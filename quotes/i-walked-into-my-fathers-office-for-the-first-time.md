I walked into my father's office for the first time when I was 16. It was barren, apart from a picture of his family and a monitor. 

No books. No artwork. My dad's a simple guy. 

But I asked him the way a son kids his dad, "why don't you put up your PhD diploma like other folks, so they can know of your greatness?"

My dad paused. "Because I want them to feel my greatness."

We both laughed. He's one of the most humble people I know. But his words never left me - even if it was a joke on both sides. 

He didn't care about titles. He didn't want to brag to people about his titles or pull rank. I don't think he wanted a corner office (but I'm sure he didn't mind at some level).

Point is: do you talk the talk or walk the walk? I hope people can trust me for who I am, and not where I've been or what I've done.

If this was written by Adam Grant would it get 10,000 likes?

I don't have much of a following, so I can't have an opinion worth 10,000 likes. That's the way it is. And that's okay. 

The quality of an idea is the impact it offers on someone, to empower and enable them to do good in the world. Not whether someone likes the idea, though correlation is a thing.

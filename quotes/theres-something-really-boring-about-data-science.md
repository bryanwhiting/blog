There's something really boring about numbers.

Maybe it's that glazed look my friends and family yield every time I try to describe what I do. I really do tire of that glazed look. 

Sometimes I like to think I'm Cypher from The Matrix, looking at that iconic cascading array of green numbers and saying "there's a brunette, there's a blonde"... 

But even after 10 years sometimes I just see numbers. Really boring numbers. 

Until I discover their story.

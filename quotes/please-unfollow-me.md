Please, unfollow me. 

It's a thing when you post on the internet that you start craving likes. 

That's not the value of the post. 

The value is that I'm putting my thoughts into production. When I do that, I learn. 

I post every day so I can learn. If you're learning with me, keep it up. If you're not, please unfollow me and get on to better content.

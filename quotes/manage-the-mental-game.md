Manage the Mental Game

Watching the best players in the world is fun, because even the best players in the world still feel like the worst players in the world. The emotional game is the same. Nobody feels good enough. Nobody liked how that turns out. And if you're lucky to win (after all the hard work you put in), you're probably more relieved than excited. 

It's hard going into an event with total expectations of success. Perhaps that's not the right mindset. Perhaps the right mindset is to just try your best on any given shot. 

Watch the world number 1 miss tons of puts by inches. How he recovers and maintains perspective for all 18 holes is why he's number 1.

As a stastician, each shot should technically be uncorrelated: the quality of a shot shouldn't be determined by the quality of the prior shot. But the mind plays lots of games. Mental correlation is real. Manage the mind game. Take each day as independent.

A good decision is associated with, but not causal of a good outcome.

You can make a bad decision and have a good outcome. 

A decision happens before the consequence. Making a decision is a process. Making a good decision involves a thoughtful process. 

Most choices are probabilistic. There are a range of probable outcomes. 

Luck is what happens after the decision is made and the outcome is good. 

Should I take fentanyl? Highly probable outcome of ruining your life, though not guaranteed.

Should I invest in #ai? Highly probable outcome of improving your business in some way, though it may tank you. 

Should I hire this employee/join this company? Wide range of possible future outcomes. 

Good #leadership recognizes the result is not decision.

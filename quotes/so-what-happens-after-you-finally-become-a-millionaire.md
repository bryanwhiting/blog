So what happens after you finally become a millionaire?

Hopefully not, but there's probably a chance you're waiting on that day. Waiting to have enough money. To vest. To cross that threshold. It's quite natural to want money. Nobody can truly say they don't. 

But imagine the day you hit 1,000,000 in your accounts. What's next?

You're probably going to be focused on the next dollar. Maybe the next million. Because the person you were before the millionth dollar will be the same person after the millionth dollar. 

Are you enjoying life today? Am I?

Buffett told Brian Chesky to make his money slowly. 

And then there's this banger:

"On the last day of class, I ask my students to turn those theoretical lenses on themselves, to find cogent answers to three questions: First, how can I be sure that I’ll be happy in my career? Second, how can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse and my family become an enduring source of happiness? Third, how can I be sure I’ll stay out of jail? Though the last question sounds lighthearted, it’s not. Two of the 32 people in my Rhodes scholar class spent time in jail. Jeff Skilling of Enron fame was a classmate of mine at HBS. These were good guys—but something in their lives sent them off in the wrong direction."

- Clayton Christensen

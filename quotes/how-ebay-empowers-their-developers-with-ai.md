3 ways in how eBay empowers their developers with AI

1. Turn on GitHub copilot
2. Fine tune LLama (open source GPT) on their own million line code base
3. Turn internal documents into a RAG database: essentially just make it more searchable. 

AI search is the next level of useful search. Google's been doing it, but now everyone can do it. 

Wild.

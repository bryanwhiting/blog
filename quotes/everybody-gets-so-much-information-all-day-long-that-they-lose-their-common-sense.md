"Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense." - Gertrude Stein

Seems oddly prescient for today's day and age. 

A few thoughts:

- I used Google Maps everywhere when I first moved to DC. When I hopped in a friends car and noticed she didn't use any navigation, I was shocked because we both lived there the same amount of time. What have I relegated to a machine that I could have learned myself? What am I going to relegate to #ai ? 

- A few months I cut out a lot of news I thought I "should" be reading and instead focused on the stuff I personally thought was applicable or rewarding. Lots of life improvements by making that choice. I like to focus now on news I can apply today, and focus much less on things I can't control at all. Eventually, if it super important, I'll find out about it by talking to someone. 

- Paul C Fisher company spent $1M in developing anti-gravity space pens. Before that they used pencils.

Four principles of good conflict

- Frame it as a debate rather than a conflict
- Argue as if you're right but listen as if you're wrong and be willing to change your mind 
- Give the most respectful interpretation of the other person's perspective
- Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you've learned from them. 

Adam Grant, as quoted in

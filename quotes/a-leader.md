I walked hesitantly into the glass conference room and see over 20 other coworkers. The middle table was full and the chairs lining the walls were going fast. 

Then Aparna Sarin walks in and makes quick use of the 30 minute meeting. 40 comments quickly volley back and forth. Like a judge before a jury, Aparna helps the audience categorize and coordinate their notes and tasks. They discuss "unknown unknowns", which before this day was an unknown unknown concept to me. She finishes with a smile and a joke and everyone leaves talking. 

Nobody likes meetings, because they're not executed like this.

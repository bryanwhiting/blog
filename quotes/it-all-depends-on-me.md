A leadership failure mode is thinking I have the answers. Thinking I'm smart. Thinking it all depends on me. Thinking I'm the solely accountable individual.

If it all depended on me, why did I hire someone? Why do I have direct reports?

It depends on my people. It depends on all of us. It depends on teamwork. 

And my team relies on me for their livelihood. Their child's medical bills. Their alimony payments. Their parental care. 

They chose me way more than I chose them.

Teamwork makes the dream work baby.

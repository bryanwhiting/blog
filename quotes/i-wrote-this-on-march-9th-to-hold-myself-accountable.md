I wrote this on March 9th to hold myself accountable. My personal 100 day challenge. 

I scheduled this for 100 days after March 9th for June 17th, the day you see this. 

I'm going to post for 100 days. I've been writing for the last 100 days on my blog, bryanwhiting.com. 

Why am I going to write every day for 100 days?

- To learn. Posting is like promoting a thought to prod. #devops I learn from feedback, please challenge my thoughts. 
- To empower. I believe I have thoughts worth sharing. I've been terrified to share them my whole life, so I've kept them to myself. Perhaps someone will benefit from these thoughts. 
- To be rejected. I want to be unfollowed. Disliked. I want the freedom to fail. I've been too hesitant to post or write because "what will they think?" 
- To get over myself. Maybe posting frequently comes off as vainglorious. Your call. For me I believe 
- To trust in myself. I've relied on external validation my whole life to know if I'm doing the right direction. For some, posting incessantly shows a high degree of self insecurity - that they're looking for validation. For me, I post my #failure s, my #lessonslearned . Vulnerability is growth. Trusting in myself is holding to a belief that I have something worth sharing and I don't need approval to share it. 
- To connect. If you follow me, you're a human following someone quite human. I hope to promote humanity. We're all in this together. 

How'd I do?

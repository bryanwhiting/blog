I'm going to let you down. 

Eventually, somewhere, somehow, you will be disappointed in me the longer you know me. 

I'm going to mess up. I'm going to make mistakes. I'm going to fail. 

But by me writing this, hopefully you know my commitment to helping you, encouraging you, surprising you, and empowering you with whatever you asked me to do or whatever you relied on me for.

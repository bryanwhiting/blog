  <title>How to Sign in with iCloud Calendar on Outlook for iOS</title>

<p>How do I add an iCloud account to iOS Outlook without it being a public calendar?</p>
<p>It was easy to add any gmail accounts but I didn’t know how to add my iCloud calendar to iOS Outlook. Part of the issue is my iCloud account is actually my gmail email address so I can’t sign in with this or it’ll load my gmail calendar.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to iOS settings &gt; iCloud &gt; get your <code>@icloud.com</code> name. If you use your gmail account for iCloud there’s still this <code>@icloud</code> account.</li>
<li>Attempt to log into iOS Outlook calendar. Apple will then make you create an app-specific password for iOS Outlook</li>
<li>Use this password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Done. Pain solved.</p>

<p><a href="../book-review/beyond-band-of-brothers.html">Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters</a></p>
<p>Leadership from the bayonette. 10 points of leadership by dick winters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strive to be a leader of character, competence, and courage.</li>
<li>Lead from the front. Say, “Follow me!” and then lead the way.</li>
<li>Stay in top physical shape—physical stamina is the root of mental toughness.</li>
<li>Develop your team. If you know your people, are fair in setting realistic goals and expectations, and lead by example, you will develop teamwork.</li>
<li>Delegate responsibility to your subordinates and let them do their jobs. You can’t do a good job if you don’t have a chance to use your imagination or your creativity.</li>
<li>Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don’t wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind.</li>
<li>Remain humble. Don’t worry about who receives the credit. Never let power or authority go to your head.</li>
<li>Take a moment of self-reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself if you did your best.</li>
<li>True satisfaction comes from getting the job done. The key to a successful leader is to earn respect—not because of rank or position, but because you are a leader of character.</li>
<li>Hang tough!—Never, ever give up.</li>

  <title>A Costly Mistake</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“This is the moment I’ve been waiting for”…until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Several years ago as a budding data scientist I got excited by using a massive compute cluster. This is it. This is when I get to do Big Data Science, baby!</p>
<p>A few thousand dollars later, I realized my hundred-dollar-an-hour cluster wasn’t doing the thing I hired it to do.</p>
<p>My patient manager David Mantilla ssh’d into my cluster and discovered that out of the 64 cores I paid for, I was using only 1.</p>
<p>A good manager goes a long way. He just laughed as I stared in horror at my gross misconduct.</p>
<p>Be kind to the noobs. Because you still are one in many ways…</p>

  <title>Implementing Culture</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/implementing-culture.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>One of the most important asset a company wields is its culture.</p>
<p>A culture is hard to define, but you know it when you see it. It’s the collective personality and written and unwritten rules of engagement. Since corporate employment is a social contract of two at-will parties, the culture emerges from the rules of conduct in which the employer is satisfied with continuing employment of the employee.</p>
<p>Values are lip service without implementation. Assume your company has the value “be kind”. Everyone has a different interpretation of what that means to them.</p>
<p>How do you know what a good culture is? People know the values of the culture and can highlight practices examples of it. The culture should live naturally, but also mechanically. Meaning, an employee will be kind while holding the door open for someone (be kind), but also provide explicit growth-oriented feedback.</p>
<p>Signs of a bad culture are therefore evident in the opposite of my definition. Like Lord of the Flies, employees are fending for survival and constantly exploring the boundaries because there are now rules of government. Employees that can’t recount what the values are or demonstrate how the company mechanically employs them are hoping for natural demonstration but get confused when they get mixed signals.</p>
<p>Toxic cultures can achieve financial success. “Toxic” has no concrete definition, but probably reveals people trying to survive on the island rather than thrive in a civilization. It stands, therefore, that a great culture will endure the battles of business, and come out tighter. At some point it won’t matter how bright your people are, how clever your IP is, or how many customers you have: culture is the rudder.</p>

  <title>Nothing to Lose</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/nothing-to-lose.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There was a moment when I had everything to lose. When I was junior in high school, I was scared I’d be cut from the lacrosse team. There was only one coach and he didn’t have space for everybody. Coach held try outs.</p>
<p>My dad was traveling the week of try outs. I gave him a call. “What if I don’t make the team?”</p>
<p>He waits till I finish. And in a way characteristic of my Dad, he re-emphasizes the question. “<em>What</em> if? You go out there, you play your hardest, you give it your all. The rest is out of your hands. If you get cut, you get cut.”</p>
<p>He didn’t give me false praise or reassurance. He gave me perspective on life. He gave me “nothing to lose.”</p>
<p>I never worked harder in my athletics than that week. I just didn’t want to get cut.</p>
<p>Well, I passed try outs. So did everyone else because it was just a coaching trick to motivate us…but that’s beside the point. But my dad’s advice was never lost on me.</p>
<p>I had low confidence the whole season. Yet my coach took a surprising interest in me. I got playing time as a junior. I was a part time defender.</p>
<p>Little did I know, nor could I ever have imagined as a defender who could barely pass or catch, that in my coach’s last game, I would be sitting on the wrong side of the field. I would be standing, as a defender, right in front of the opposing team’s goalie crease. I’m not quite sure how I got there as the whole season I always sprinted off the field whenever we transitioned from defense to offense.</p>
<p>My coach always yelled at me. “Stay on the field!! It’s a fast break!” But I was always terrified of dropping the ball. I was great at defense. Great at scooping the ball. Great at passing it to an offender. This was my safe place.</p>
<p>Yet here I was, in the final minutes of the game. We had three, they had five. And I’m on the crease. What was I doing here?</p>
<p>My eyes and voice called to my teammate who saw me. My teammate who knew full well I had no intention of actually catching the ball. My teammate who would love to pass it to me if he had any assurance I’d actually catch it. I could see his eyes lock with mine and it only takes 8 years playing a sport to recognize that split-second glance, “Are you going to actually catch this?” My eyes asserted in that moment with my stick extended and ready “I really don’t know. But I’m wide open and I’m on the crease. And you have the defender and not me. So make a call.”</p>
<p>To my surprise he actually passed it. It didn’t have to be a just perfunctory vanity motion to please the coach. Because I’ve called for the ball many times in that wrote script, “oh please pass it I swear it’s worth all our time okay I did my thing now you guys go score because I’m outta here!”</p>
<p>I catch. I turn. I dunk. 4-5.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>I asked Teddy later why he actually passed it to me. “I figured, what the heck? Maybe he’ll catch it!!” We both laughed. He had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>I didn’t know it then, but it was the last goal anybody would score for my coach. It was the last game of the season. The last game of his 35 year career at our school. I was wholly undeserving.</p>
<p>And that’s when you stand most to gain.</p>

  <title>Trajectory and Mindset</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/trajectory-and-mindset.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tony Robbins has said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are. <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/tony-robbins-quotes/">Tony Robbins Quotes, Read These Famous Quotes from Tony Robbins</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book <a href="../book-review/mindset.html">Mindset</a> talks about “fixed” vs “growth” mindsets. My post <a href="../posts/decisions-are-rivers.html">Decisions are Like Hopping on a River Raft</a> - decisions take you down to known endpoints.</p>
<p>Bring those two concepts together and on one hand there’s a trajectory - where you’re capable of going given your decisions (and mindset) and your mindset - how you perceive your circumstances.</p>
<p>Someone recently told me, “It’s not what you go through but how you perceive what you’re going through that matters.”</p>
<p>I believe perception is powerful. Any negative situation can be reframed for a positive. This is mindset.</p>
<p>But the other component is also important: where your circumstances will take you if pursued every day for the next 30 years.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-mountain-in-a-mountain-range.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Are you aimed toward the valley or the mountain? Neither is better, but one is probably better to you</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If you’re an extremely happy person but you don’t take action to get out of a minimum wage job, such as spend time on self improvement, you’re going to stay in your minimum wage job (nothing wrong with that, just trying to illustrate a point).</p>
<p>And so, to get what you want out of life you can’t just assume things will get better without any change on your part. You can 1) change your mindset or 2) change your trajectory.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered whether at times in my career I was complacent or not, or whether I was growing doing what I was doing. That’s not a helpful question. Because if you’re too myopic you can miss that you doing your multiplication tables isn’t going to change anyone’s life, but if you can’t do multiplication you can’t be a machine learning engineer.</p>
<p>Most days in our work are steps. Steps towards something.</p>
<p>A spaceman can’t land on the moon unless they build a rocket. They won’t make a rocket unless they choose to land on the moon. And by choosing the moon they’re choosing to <em>not</em> open a Chinese restaurant.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Some roles have upper bounds. Staying at that upper bound isn’t a bad thing. It’s just a thing. Other roles open up different opportunities the longer you stick around, opportunities you won’t get else where perhaps.</p>
<p>So if you’re feeling stuck, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will I be if I stay with this for the next two years?</li>
<li>Is that directionally where I want now to head?</li>
<li>Is there something about my mindset I can change today to help me reframe so that I don’t miss the opportunities already around me?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTH.</p>


<aside id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document">

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Who has more impact? Well as cool as it is to land on the moon, it doesn’t actually do anything practically useful. A restaurant prevents millions of people from starving throughout its existence.↩︎</p></li>

<p>I once played a game of pickup basketball with my football captain. He was a linebacker. All state. And got drafted to play in college. He was an incredible athlete.</p>
<p>But he moved like a clunky robot while playing basketball and couldn’t make a layup for his life.</p>
<p>Sometimes that’s how we are. As leaders, we should aim to help find where the misfits thrive.</p>

  <title>World’s Longest Drive</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There’s a fun $75,000 purse for the winner of the World’s Longest Drive.</p>
<p>These guys are averaging 400y in contest, which is an attempt to drive straight. This guy wins (ofc) but his first round is the best. 432.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gv3YACYV648?si=jXXsfxfHxpmcpHFZ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Apparently the record is 515 set in 1974 by Mike Austin, a 64 year old.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s kind of crazy that since 1974 the record for longest drive hasn’t been broken.</li>
<li>Tech helps, but old school can sometimes be the way. Form over gear all day.</li>
</ol>
<p>But Berkshire broke that record per his Instagram account. Here’s the full scoop:</p>

<p>Hemingway introduced through his writing style the <a href="https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2023/1/1646.pdf">Iceberg Theory</a>. It was something I noticed while reading <a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a>. You feel the depth of emotion from the “actions and dialogue”, rather than explicit descriptions.</p>
<p>It’s fun to contrast that with <a href="../concepts/frank-herbert.html">Frank Herbert</a>’s style which is “lay out the environment, have dialogue, then draw conclusions in the mind”.</p>
<p>Both styles speak to the thought that the writing is more interesting the less you write about. They call this “negative space” in drawing. A sketch is interesting when the mind can fill in the gaps. As an artist, you just want to make enough dots that they can connect them themselves. This connecting process is the freedom and interest the mind craves. It doesn’t want to be coddled (<a href="../book-review/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.html">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>).</p>
<p>Back to the book. The Old Man and the Sea can be summarized in one sentence: a tired, old, and recently-unlucky man catches the biggest of his life and it gets eaten before he makes it home.</p>
<p>That’s the surface story, and it’s rather boring when thought of that way. But you just <em>feel</em> so much while reading it. You feel for the old man through the young boy. You feel for him as he teeters between passing out and existing. You remember the breaking points in your own life and want the man desperately to succeed. Luck, however, was not on his side.</p>
<p>“Talk less. Smile more.” - Hamilton</p>

  <title>The Compounding Interest of Reading</title>

<p>I’m on my way to get 52 books read this year. I think I can do it.</p>
<p>But it’s not to finish 52 books. It’s to read two hours of fifty two books. Why?</p>
<p>Because of compounding interest. One book doesn’t level you up. But multiple books over time will affect you for a long while to come.</p>
<p>If you improve just 1% each day for 365 days, and that improvement compounds, then you’ll have improved 37x over a year. (invest $100 and gain 1% each day and reinvest that money is $137 by the end of the year).</p>
<p>So don’t worry what any one book gives you. Just keep investing. A few will pay off big, and the many “wasted” will have little downside.</p>

  <title>The Power of a Good Book</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/the-power-of-a-good-book.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Last night I went to a tapas style restaurant. I got 5 things. Then we opted for one more: battered cod tacos. Our taste buds rewarded us. That’s why we came.</p>
<p>Before that I was telling my wife, “I don’t see why my friend didn’t like the sushi. It’s fine. I just don’t know how to evaluate if something is worth it or not. Because it’s tasty, I’d recommend it…” This came off the heels of multiple times recently where I’ve gone out with people who are foodies that criticize the meal I’m enjoying and I’m left wondering: am I a food plebe?</p>
<p>Experiencing this last night was poignant. The whole meal was good. Not bad. Just good.</p>
<p>Then came the fish tacos.</p>
<p>That’s how it is with reading. You need to read a lot before the good and the bad start filtering out.</p>
<p>And like fish tacos, maybe there are even better ones out there, but I needed this one to point me in the direction of what’s possible.</p>
<p>And to some degree, there’s a dulling of sensitivities. If you haven’t read good literature in a long while perhaps you assume it’s all fine and “why <em>not</em> finish this book?”</p>
<p>But this year I’m trying to read many authors across many genres to tackle just that: find the books I really enjoy reading. And then ask myself, “why? What was special there?” So that I know what to look for next.</p>
<p>Last night I began <a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a> and it was a fish taco moment. I don’t know how I’ve avoided this book so long. I’m sure I read it in like sixth grade, but does that even count? And why have I largely avoided fiction for most of my adult life? I suppose having studied something very technical in college it pushed me to stop using that side of my brain. But getting back to good books, written with such depth and creative imagination, renew me with an awareness of the dullness of business books I’ve been dwelling in.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">An Old Man and His Tacos</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And now, for ChatGPT to answer the prompt: “in the style of Ernest Hemingway, write three paragraphs about a man eating fish tacos”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the style of Ernest Hemingway, characterized by his terse and direct prose, the tale unfolds on a weathered pier stretching into the gray, restless sea. The man, solitary and rugged, sits at the edge where the wood meets the water, a plate of fish tacos beside him. His hands, calloused and strong, deftly assemble the tacos with an economy of movement that speaks of a life shaped by necessity rather than choice. The fish, freshly caught, bears the scent of the ocean, a fragrance as old as time, mingling with the sharp tang of lime and cilantro.</p>
<p>Around him, the world seems to hold its breath, the only sounds are the soft lapping of waves against the pilings and the distant cries of gulls, wheeling like specters in the overcast sky. He bites into a taco, the crispness of the tortilla giving way to the tender fish within, a simplicity that belies the depth of flavors. There’s a harmony here, between man and nature, a momentary peace found in the act of eating, of sustaining oneself with the bounty of the sea.</p>
<p>As he eats, his gaze is drawn to the horizon, where the gray of the sea blends indistinguishably with the sky. There’s a contemplation in his eyes, a man adrift in his thoughts as he is in life, finding solace in the simple pleasure of a meal. The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself—uncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction. In this moment, on this pier, the man and the sea are one, their stories intertwined in the quiet, unspoken understanding that life, in all its forms, is a series of solitary moments shared with the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dang…“life shaped by necessity rather than choice” and “The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself—uncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction.” I’m glad Ernest is somewhere in there, AI. You may have a soul after all.</p>

  <title>Export your Libby Timeline to Obsidian</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/export-your-libby-timeline-to-obsidian.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I love reading and I love writing. Both are integral parts of learning. The reading to receive new ideas, the writing to cement those ideas to something.</p>
<p>As I stood up my blog I wondered how to get past books on here. There’s a way!</p>
<p>I now use Audible and Spotify audiobooks, but most of my past reads come from Libby.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Libby</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Here’s how you do it using Python:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open Libby app and figure out how to export your timeline. Somewhere in settings. It’ll produce a CSV.</li>
<li>Go through that CSV and creat a column “read” that identified the ones you actually began (sigh…so many books I placed holds on but never read….)</li>
<li>Run this python script and it’ll create an obsidian markdown file for each. Tweak it to match your preferences. I personally use <code>quarto</code> to blog so I have a naming convention for the files and metadata.</li>
<li>Or! Just ask ChatGPT to do this for you lol.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
import os
import zipfile
import re

# Load the provided spreadsheet using pandas
file_path = "~/Downloads/libbytimeline-activities.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Parse the timestamp into the format yyyy-mm-dd and rename the column to 'date'
df["timestamp_raw"] = df["timestamp"]
df["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"], format="%m/%d/%y %H:%M")
# create a stringed date
df["date"] = df["timestamp"].dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

df[["date", "timestamp_raw"]]

# Custom column: Filter rows where read == 1 (went through spreadsheet to filter out those I had borrowed but never read).
df = df[df["read"] == 1]

# De-duplicate by title, keeping the most recent record (sorted by date)
df = df.sort_values("timestamp", ascending=False).drop_duplicates("title")

# Create a new column 'created' with today's date in yyyy-mm-dd format
today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
df["created"] = today

# Create a new column 'date-finished' that's the timestamp's date + 21 days
df["date-finished"] = (df["timestamp"] + timedelta(days=21)).dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Prepare for markdown file creation
output_directory = os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/markdown_files")
os.makedirs(output_directory, exist_ok=True)

# Loop through each item in the dataframe and create a markdown file
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    markdown_content = f"""

    filename = re.sub(r"[^\w]", "-", row["title"]).lower()
    filename = re.sub(r"-+", "-", filename)
    file_path = os.path.join(output_directory, f"{filename}.md")
    with open(file_path, "w") as file:
        file.write(markdown_content.strip())
    print(f"Created {file_path}")

# Zip the markdown files
zip_file_path = os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/markdown_files.zip")
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, "w") as zipf:
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(output_directory):
        for file in files:
            zipf.write(os.path.join(root, file), file)</code></pre>

  <title>Become a Data Scientist in 10 Weeks</title>

<p>How do you get a job in data science if you currently aren’t a data scientist?</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-simple callout-tip no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>The simplest thing you can do to get experience is do 5 Kaggle competitions and use ChatGPT like crazy to learn how to code, annalyze data, and build models. Use the ChatGPT code interpreter for $20/month and see how it works. Test its limits. If you’re new to data science, you won’t understand where it’s wrong, so just ask it: “how might this answer you gave me be wrong?”</p>
<p>The rest of this focuses on how to master the fundamentals, which will take you much farther and give you a foundation to build off of. But when in doubt, “doing” data science is much better than “learning” data science from books. Always strike a balance in your efforts: it takes far less time to read and learn principles, but it’s far more valuable to try “doing” a data science project with code.</p>

</div>
<section id="my-path-to-ds" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>My path to DS</h1>
<p>I asked this question while working as an analyst 8 years ago and wanting to break into data science. I wrote about it back then (lost the post), so I’m gonna revisit it now.</p>
<p>I was asked this question today: “how do I get started and get a job in data science if I don’t have any experience?” You may then wonder “I can’t get experience without a job…this is a chicken-and-egg problem.” False.</p>
<p>Simple: get experience. For free. In 10 weeks. Write a good resume. Network like crazy: connect with real people (and not just spam). Get rejected probably 20-30 times, learn from each rejection, keep learning and presto, you’ll finally have an offer. It’s honestly just a numbers game. Everyone “ahead” of you is an imposter just like you. Just figure out enough basics and you’ll be ready for your first job.</p>
<p>There are a million ways to do this, and a million blog posts like this one. But here’s my suggestion. Enjoy!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="no-single-data-science-definition" class="level1">
<h1>No Single Data Science Definition</h1>
<p>Look at 10 job postings for data science and you’ll see 10 unique definitions for a data scientist. Roughly, I’d categorize them as such:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Human decision support: someone who supports others in their decision making. This would be their boss, their team, etc. Decisions are: should we shut this line of business down? Are our customers churning and how do we prevent that?</li>
<li>Machine Decision Support: someone who helps machines make automated decisions, like whether to approve an online credit card application, recommend a YouTube video, etc.</li>
<li>Product developer: someone who uses data to build a web product or service. This is similar to machine decision support, but the role might be in a SaaS capacity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these things below will help with 1-2. Today, AI products are all the rage and I offer one week on deep learning to get you interested in 3. That being said, all the principles in each one of these sections is important in any field you pursue. # Mindset</p>
<p>While doing the following, on weeks 2-10, write one blog post to outline what you learned.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Where did you start? Why was it hard to learn? What did you want to know?</li>
<li>What concepts were new to you?</li>
<li>Do something with that knowledge. Search the internet to find data you can write about.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t get very far, just move on to the next topic. Breadth is better early on to find out what you enjoy. Don’t get caught up in the details. Skim more. Write more. Worry less. You got this.</p>
<p>In all things, use ChatGPT to tutor you. Ask it questions. Be relentless. Have it explain things to you like you’re five.</p>
<p>Balancing learning between real books and ChatGPT is the best combo. ChatGPT is a better teacher, and the books have real info in them you can more fully trust. Using both together will get you there faster.</p>
<p>If any of the books below don’t vibe for you, there are a million free books out there. Find a simpler one and the same topic (and post in the comments so I can add it!)</p>
</section>
<section id="week-1-prepare-to-share" class="level1">
<h1>Week 1: Prepare to Share</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By creating a blog you demonstrate the following: you like to learn, you can communicate, you can do hard things, you’re naturally curious, you’re contributing to the ecosystem. Lots of ways to show those things, but having a blog is at least one way.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Set up a blog.
<ul>
<li>Medium.com</li>
<li>Substack.com</li>
<li>(Harder) Or use <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> and publish on GitHub</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find 5 blogs by top data scientists. Read their posts. See what they write about.</li>
<li>Your first blog post is about what you like about these 5 blogs.</li>
<li>Share your blog post on all social media. LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="week-2-storytelling" class="level1">
<h1>Week 2: Storytelling</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You can’t get credit for great data science work unless you can tell a story. Now that you have a blog, learn how to write about data.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/">Telling Stories with Data</a></li>
<li>Find three data-focused blogs that use charts and analysis. Economist, FiveThirtyEight, DataIsBeautiful, etc.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="week-3-analytics-and-data-intuition" class="level1">
<h1>Week 3: Analytics and Data Intuition</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To be able to make predictions about the future, you first need to understand how to understand the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analytics is the foundation of data science. It’s the process of manipulating data and reshaping it to see it in new ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wesmckinney.com/book/">Python for Data Analysis, 3E</a> - written by the creator of <code>pandas</code></li>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science (2e)</a> - written by the creator of <code>dplyr</code>, the best data manipulation language ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these books are great. Read both. It’s good to learn early that there are multiple right ways of doing your analysis the wrong way 😉. Seeing how to think in two languages is actually easier than getting stuck on one.</p>
<p>Related: understand the bias in your data.</p>

<li><a href="https://datasciencehorizons.com/thinking-clearly-data-scientist-guide-understanding-cognitive-biases/">Thinking Clearly: A Data Scientist’s Guide to Understanding Cognitive Biases [eBook] – Data Science Horizons</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-5-biases-data-science/">Top 5 Biases in Data Science to Know for Model’s Accuracy</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="week-4-data-visualization" class="level1">
<h1>Week 4: Data Visualization</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Learning how to make a plot is like learning how to write. Learn how colors work. When to use them. When to use a bar vs.&nbsp;a line chart. How to make ideas shine.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jjallaire.github.io/visualization-curriculum/">Visualization Curriculum</a></li>
<li><a href="https://r-graphics.org/">R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd edition</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is after analytics because analytics is more important (knowing what to look for and how to think about data) than plotting it.</p>
<p>There are two types of plots: those for you to learn from and those for others to learn from. First, learn what’s in the data. Learn for yourself.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Look at the plot. Look at the plot. No seriously, look at the plot.” Chris Peterson, Capital One</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, plot for other people. After you’ve learned something by sifting out all the noise, learn how to communicate that externally.</p>
<p>Beautiful plotting is really hard and time consuming. Details can take hours. Focus on the basics at first. The simplest plot focuses on “what’s the one thing I want someone to take away from this?”</p>
</section>
<section id="week-5-get-data-you-dont-yet-have" class="level1">
<h1>Week 5: Get Data You Don’t Yet Have</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you work at a company &gt; 50 people, your company’s data is probably stored in a database. Learning how to get this data so you can do data analytics and visualization will help you be self sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analytics is more important than this, because someone else may be able to get you the data. Or, once you know analytics then you can use SQL to <em>do</em> analytics.</p>
<p>Three primary ways to get data include the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SQL (from a database, returns a spreadsheet like table)</li>
<li>API (get data from a website, returns JSON data)</li>
<li>Webscraping (getting it yourself, this is considered “unstructured” data)</li>
</ol>
<p>Interactive tutorials here are the way to go. Just google around for some good ones.</p>

<p>If you’re making automated decisions with data, you’re probably using a recommendation system at some level.

But the principles also extend to: how do I recommend one course of action to my stakeholder?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t have great resources here, but getting the concepts down will help you understand how virtually every social media app or streaming service works. (Netflix, Spotify, Instagram, etc all use recommenders to figure out the content you’re interested in. )</p>

<p>I’ve loved the advice I found written up here: <a href="../posts/2022-11-18-writing-a-tech-resume/index.html">Writing a Tech Resume</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have a good resume, find real people to give it to. Dont apply blindly online. Talk to everyone you know. Find people on LinkedIn and message them directly with a personal message. Use one of your blog posts in your message to tell them why you’re a good fit for their role. Perhaps even write a blog post specific to data from their company!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

  <title>The Only Mind that’s Clear Is the One That Sees No Alternative</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The easiest thing one can do is see the world through their own viewpoints. It takes no effort. Takes no work. It’s already done: your viewpoints are there. Either you care about climate change today or you don’t. Either you care about opossums or you don’t. You are who you are, right now.</p>
<p>The only gap between who you are today and who you are tomorrow is what you learn and experience and how you see the world because of what you learn and experience.</p>
<p>You learn from others. You learn from your experiences. You learn from other’s experiences.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t to be right. The goal is to understand.</p>
<p>And so, I believe in the value of learning from those around me, especially those I disagree with. It’s hard work to grind through walls of disbelief or misunderstanding. But it’s always worth it, even if at the other side you merely understand. That in and of itself is a destination worth pursuing because of the many benefits it yields.</p>
<p>But beware, with an assumption of understanding comes peril. Therefore, the goal is to constantly seek understanding, because no person is every the same one day to the next.</p>

  <title>Writing Only Makes Sense to the Author</title>

<p><em>If you’re a bad author</em>, your writing will only make sense to you.</p>
<p>Problem is, we’re all bad authors.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>My writing makes sense as I put it fown</li>
<li>It doesn’t always make sense to me 5 minutes later (my future self is practically another person)</li>
<li>The probability of it being perfectly interpreted by someone who isn’t even me, is likely near zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>So when we write, we send out an idea. It then becomes a painting on the wall, up for anyone to interpret how they may.<sup>1</sup> therefore, it’s best to put yourself as much in your audience’s shoes as possible (something discussed often in <a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a>).</p>

  <title>The Problem with Public Opinions</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/the-problem-with-public-opinions.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>If you become a public opinion person (author, speaker, podcaster), you’re inherently inviting publicity bias.</p>
<p>A message is like a product. If it’s not well received, either through attention, clicks, or books purchased, then most people may abandon the idea. Very few (those seeking truth), are staunch advocates of an opinion not popularly received.</p>
<p>Even unpopular opinion people try out their ideas. They may rise on social media as “they want to cancel me, so trust my opinion”. That sales pitch only lasts so long as you’re a minority.</p>
<p>Point is: if your opinion gets reception, you’re less likely to change your opinion. This is a problem in politics for people who espouse something for a long time.</p>
<p>Instead we should be like Galileo: show me the data.</p>
<p>So be cautious if people like your opinion because you may be at risk of not being able to change it, either through your own evolving greed or desire for social acceptance and popularity.</p>
<p>The reception of an idea doesn’t determine its truthfulness, but the ability of the idea to stand on its own.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-galileo-stars.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Look for the evidence, not the popularity</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I always try to think about this when listening to a popular author or podcaster: what about their idea has garnered popularity? Have they changed course in the face of evidence? I recall Amy Cuddy having one of the most popular Ted talks on Power Poses, only to have a Slate article come out that refused her research. She doubled down despite her research not being reproducible: the gold standard a scientist should seek.</p>
<p>Few people are like Amy Cuddy in that their ideas cannot be easily tested and so the world lazily believes them. This is the risk: when people stop thinking for themselves.</p>
<p>Things why Frank Herbert wrote <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>: to encourage people to think for themselves and not put too much trust in their leaders.</p>

<p>Chapter 14 of <a href="../book-review/the-quest-for-cosmic-justice.html">The Quest for Cosmic Justice</a> discusses this way better than I do here.</p>

  <title>You can plan your life in 5 minutes</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/you-can-plan-your-life-in-5-minutes.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It doesn’t take 30 years to plan a good life. It’s actually quite simple and if you sit down for 5 minutes you can figure out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do you like where you’re at? Heading? No? Where do you want to go? Why? What do you need to change to get there?</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>No fancy grand vision. No elaborate planning. Just maybe 15 minutes to plan ahead.</p>
<p>The speed of planning is 0.01% of the effort required to execute. “We’re going to the moon by the end of the decade”. Plan. Done. Execution is hard.</p>
<p>Ideas are fleeting. Plans are changeable. Plans and ideas aren’t the IP of your company. It’s the people and the execution. Thats the hard part.</p>

<p>Badly formatted code attracts more badly formatted code.</p>
<p>But the same is for good: a clean floor makes you want to keep it clean.</p>
<p>So what explains the fulcrum - where is the balance between accepting dire straights vs pushing for perfection? We oscillate between these worlds as our attention wanders.</p>
<p>I’m guessing the fulcrum is based on incentives. Guests coming over? Clean up the house. Boss reviewing? Clean the code.</p>

  <title>Biden’s debt relief won’t relieve what he thinks it will</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/bidens-debt-relief-wont-relieve-what-he-thinks-it-will.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/the-quest-for-cosmic-justice.html">The Quest for Cosmic Justice</a>, Sowell points out repeatedly how policies focused on helping a target demographic may not only hinder them, but those around them too. Policies are for politicians to pursue power, to win the next vote.</p>
<p>What good does relieving <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-9-billion-student-debt-relief">130bn</a> in university debt do?</p>
<p>the argument is that our system is broken. So we’ll fix it with money.</p>
<p>The more flawed thinking is that “education is a right.” Should this be true, then food is a right. Then social media is a right. Our phones are a right.</p>
<p>Life is a right. Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, too.</p>
<p>But my decision to go 200k in debt for an investment that didn’t return dividends (hence my inability to pay), is not a right. It’s a poor investment choice.</p>
<p>Sending out money signals a poor precedence, apart from the blatant desire to buy votes. The economics aren’t aligned. The incentives are bad.</p>
<p>“Go learn about something, investing 4 years, and discover it’s not capable of helping you earn wages” is nothing more than a sabbatical.</p>
<p>We need to spend that money incentivizing innovation. Entrepreneurs. People who create value.</p>
<p>The “educated” masses (3.6m) who cannot afford to pay their debt, when they scoffed at tradespeople who were employable the moment they finished their 3 week training, and then asked those tradespeople to pay for their schooling, is disappointing.</p>
<p>We need to think about incentives, both long and short term.</p>

<p>The solution: student loan officers should be on the hook to ask “what is your potential income return?” The loan must be payable within 8 years at a 10% additional tax on their wages. They need to be able to survive with this 10% tax, and the 10% tax over 8 years should be sufficient to pay the bills.</p>
<p>So if you have a $100k job, that’s $80k education. 10% tax for 8 years is 10k per year to pay the debt.</p>

<p>Quarto lists a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/">gallery</a> of things you can do with it.</p>
<p>This post illustrates</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How you can array your blog</li>
<li>How you can collect subscribers with just google form</li>
<li>How you can iframe other apps, such as from huggingface.</li>
</ol>
<p>I came across this site: <a href="https://forbo7.github.io/" class="uri">https://forbo7.github.io/</a>. I enjoyed seeing how they arrayed their blogs, which I had never seen before - they used grids.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/quarto-demo-forbo7-landing.png" class="preview-image img-fluid"></p>
<p>They use an embedded google form for subscriptions:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-quarto-demo-forbo7-subscribe.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And they have an<a href="https://forbo7.github.io/web_apps/apps/flood_detector.html">iframe on a Huggingface</a> app to show something cool:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/quarto-demo-forbo7-huggingface.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That’s all.</p>

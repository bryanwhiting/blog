  <title>10 steps to optimize anything</title>

<p>I love-hate goal setting. Here are 10 steps I often fail at in how I try to breakdown and achieve goals, but hey, this is LinkedIn so I’ll share…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Objective: Define your “where you are going” and your “why”.</li>
<li>Principles: Decide what’s worth it in how you pursue your where/why.</li>
<li>Key Result: Measure the goal numerically 1-3 ways. Too many is too confusing.</li>
<li>KR-Drivers: Identify the key drivers that affect the goal.</li>
<li>Hypothesize: Use data/intuition to guess what will drive increases in KR-drivers.</li>
<li>Experiment: Try 2 approaches, manipulate the drivers in big or minor ways.</li>
<li>Track: Measure/track/Log what’s needed to measure if your hypothesis was valid or rejected.</li>
<li>Analyze: make minor tweaks in the drivers and measure statistically significant changes.</li>
<li>Conclude: Which direction will increase your KR. Consider alternate paths if the experiment didn’t yield good results.</li>
<li>Periodic Evaluation: At a pre-determined cadence (1 wk, 6 wk, quarter), choose if your KR is helping you achieve your objective.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>A few lessons learned as a professional experimenter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking is not the key result. Don’t confuse them. Too many people&nbsp;&nbsp;track habits for no reason (I’m guilty of this 100%)</li>
<li>KR’s have no purpose if you don’t have an objective. You want 100k ffollowers? 100k revenue? They don’t mean anything until you know what you’re going to do with it. More fame/money doesn’t equal more life satisfaction. Lots of unhappy/depressed rich/famous people.</li>
<li>“Experimentation” early into defining a product should be massive swings. Find the “lowest hanging fruit”, make the biggest changes.</li>
<li>Have principles to guide your KR’s. If you don’t</li>
<li>Have Anti-KR’s - things you won’t do. This is the hardest. If you have 10 KR’s, perhaps KR’s 2-10 should be all anti-KR’s. Otherwise, you’ll get distracted on 2 despite you knowing 1 is most important.</li>
<li>A rising tide lifts all ships: By improving one KR, you may be sacrificing improving another. But more likely you’ll actually improve all KR’s, because they’re usually correlated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy Example: “I want to be healthier”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Objective: I want more energy to be able to devote it to my kids.</p></li>
<li><p>Principles:&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>I will not hurt my body by doing unnecessary XYZ</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not going to kill myself. I’m going to keep this simple.</p></li>
<li><p>KR:&nbsp;&nbsp;(Write down 10, pick the one that will obviate the rest)</p></li>
<li><p>Gain 10 lbs of muscle</p></li>
<li><p>Eat 100g of protein a day</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep 8 hours a day</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate 20 minutes a day</p></li>
<li><p>KR-drivers for gaining 10 lbs of muscle:</p></li>
<li><p>Lift weights</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on quads</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on upper body</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesize: If I go to the gym for 10 minutes for 28 days and do 30 exercises a day, I’ll gain muscle.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment: I’ll keep my diet the same - including the popcorn. I’ll focus my mental energy on clearing my calendar and getting out the door to the gym. The “control” experiment is what I’ve done the last 28 days…not worked out 🤣</p></li>
<li><p>Track:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Day 1: I’ll weight myself, write a journal about how I feel. Perhaps ask myself some questions.</li>
<li>Did I go to the gym for 10 minutes? I’ll keep a piece of paper and a pen taped to my mirror or on my nightstand. Checkbox. Don’t track anything else. This is my one focus right now.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Analyze: on day 28, I’ll weigh myself again.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Conclude: Did this 28-day challenge change how I felt? Be honest: it might not. Perhaps I can get on my bike, or hike, or do pushups every day instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodic evaluation: every 2 months I’ll investigate how my energy is.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>your goal isn’t to gain/lose weight. Your goal is to feel better about your health. Your key result is a number on a scale going up/down.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>#SundayThoughts Six weeks ago I stopped listening to podcasts in the morning and started listening to The Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Perhaps this book doesn’t do it for you. If so, there are other scriptures or ancient philosophy texts that teach good principles. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is a good one.</p>
<p>Listening to this timeless, ancient book every day has helped center me. It’s reminded me of God’s timetable. Of God’s intervention in the course of human nature. And of God’s unending love for us as His children.</p>
<p>How do I listen? I picked a theme: Revelation. I took notes every day on what the 10-30 minutes taught me about that theme. Now I’m working on the theme of “patience”.</p>
<p>Having this more-constant anchor in my life helps me remember what’s important each day. I feel a little bit more confidence and centered perspective each day I start with this practice.</p>

<p>Solid read: https://markmanson.net/attention-diet Over the last year I had read a few things similar to the points here and went on an “low information” diet (Tim Ferriss quote?).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I don’t miss the global news. It only got me angry.</p></li>
<li><p>The point of learning something is to take action and create positive change in the world. If I learn about things I don’t plan to take action on,</p></li>
<li><p>if that sounds uneducated, another reason to learn something is to gain empathy and change my perspective. However, the global news is generally biased by the wars for subscriptions between a handful of editors.</p></li>
<li><p>Niche news is far more educative. I’ve subscribed to blogs, to specific influencers in my field, etc. I’ve learned things from these people that I can apply that day in my job. I’m subscribing to things that feed my career.</p></li>
<li><p>long form content is far better way to understand current events. If you want to understand the state of the world, read a book on it. Most major geopolitical events are insanely complicated and cannot be surmised in 126 characters. Read a few books on the things you care about.</p></li>
<li><p>there’s so much thought put into even a low quality book. Think about it: most books get reviewed by editors in the very least. They probably get read once or twice at least by the original authors. So what would be a better time for your energy - a low quality book or a set of posts on LinkedIn likely generated by ChatGPT or Jasper.ai? If a low quality book &gt; than a tweet, surely 30 min a day of a high quality book (easy to find) is worth more than most low quality content.</p></li>
<li><p>I broke my iPhone in 2020 and waited 45 days for a replacement. But it wasn’t fully broken - the screen was hopelessly shattered on the bottom half where typing is required. So I kept it in my drawer and only used it when I needed to. The risk of using it? Getting a shard of glass stuck in my finger. I wish I still had that to some degree because it forced me to be focused. I realized very few people texted me anything urgent that couldn’t wait a few days. I could still call people with Siri, but nobody called. We’re optimized to be addicted. That’s literally the goal of these phones and the apps on them. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just not in our best interest.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried using a junk $40 replacement phone I found in my closet while waiting those 45 days to get my iPhone replacement. The phone was from 2015 when I got married - it was a teaser phone from the cell company. It probably downloaded at 2 mbp/s. Any time I clicked a link I had to wait 15-20 seconds for the page to load.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I was amazed. I was shocked this piece of junk actually could take notes. Could email. Could browse the internet. But I also learned not to click on things unless it was worth 30 seconds of my time.</p>
<p>How do I spend my time now? Not wisely enough. A lot of things should be done on a computer. Most things should be planned. Few things are urgent. Fewer are essential.</p>

  <title>A Treatise on Agency and Goals</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/a-treatise-on-agency-and-goals.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I may have ADHD to some degree, I’m not sure. These thoughts came to me today when considering my side business.</p>
<hr>
<section id="a-treatise-on-desire-uncertainty-commitment-and-execution-toward-a-goal." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-treatise-on-desire-uncertainty-commitment-and-execution-toward-a-goal.">A treatise on desire, uncertainty, commitment, and execution toward a goal.</h2>
<p>Descartes proposed that if you pick a direction and walk in a straight line you’ll eventually leave the forest. This assumes you want to leave the forest.</p>
<p>A desire is a persistent yearning. Desires take root and, when nurtured, become reality.</p>
<p>An achieved desire is a blend of hope, faith, and charity. A hope (goal) is the edge of the forest. Walking is faith (belief + action). Charity is long suffering and persistence - the ability to maintain hope and faith.</p>
<p>A hope is envisioned or observed. If observed, there is believed certainty in achievement, with uncertainty in the path. An envisioned hope has uncertainty in both the path and the outcome. You might die trying. Envisioned hopes are impossible only when the path is not made clear. Thought makes the path clear.</p>
<p>A clear path is a plan. A plan is a sequence of informed choices and actions leading towards a goal, a consequence. A causal effect. Reconnaissance is the finite time and energy spent collecting information. Reason invites spending time and energy proportional to the cost or impact of the plan and goal. Judgment determines which choices and actions are taken.</p>
<p>Commitment is recognizing many roads lead to Rome, and only one of them can be walked to actually get there.</p>
<p>Luck is unknown things. Some things could have been known with more reconnaissance. Other things could never have been known or anticipated. Luck either enables or disables the path. Luck happens post plan, post deliberation. It’s the unknown distance between you and the forest’s edge. Hindsight bias is the present mind’s ability to mistakenly believe uncertainty was always certain. “I should have known” is an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Enabling luck makes possible the goal. Disabling luck makes difficult the goal, perhaps impossible. Impossible is usually a state of mind or the laws of physics, but usually never both.</p>
<p>Tilt is the mist of blindness caused by the presence of luck. Tilt distracts from information and commitment, a bias caused by observed outcomes that were previously uncertain.</p>
<p>Commitment is time and energy. Time is measured by rotations of the earth or attempts made. Energy is measured by willingness to roll the dice again.</p>
<p>Commitment is also reconnaissance. More actions, more information. Ignorance is choosing not to see the information. Stubbornness is seeing it, and maintaining the status quo for thrill of ego. Humility is hunger for more information.</p>
<p>Uncertainty invites fear and worry. Perceived time spent amplifies fear and worry. Uncertainty in the path. Uncertainty in the destination, etc.</p>
<p>A plan is the process of committing to something knowing that hindsight bias creeps in with each step. The plan mitigates the drag of hindsight bias.</p>
<p>Fear and anxiety are compounded when accomplishment doesn’t happen within perceived time. Human nature is to lose all track of time when in a task, so time should be planned for. Time to evaluate the plan and assess new information should also be decided in the plan.</p>
<p>Commitment to the plan is a recognition of the infallibility of human emotion. Judgment is evaluating if the plan could be improved, and the plan includes time/effort-base checkpoints for evaluation. Commitment is the recognition that, while the direction you’re heading may not be the right one, (shortest path between you and the edge of the forest which you can’t know at onset), walkikg straight is better than circling from changing direction multiple times. Straight lines are incapable of not exiting. Circles may exit but are capable of not exiting.</p>
<p>If new information overrides understood information at the time of the plan, and changes the decision that would have been made given the circumstances at the time of the plan, then wisdom and humility is the ability to change direction despite how many miles walked (sunk cost).</p>
<p>Walking in a straight line in business is “walking in accordance to the plan”. The time spent deliberating the plan should be proportional to the costs and benefits of the action, which requires judgment. Inspiration is praying that God will guide you and enable your plan.</p>
<p>Arrogance is believing you have infinite energy and time. Optimism is appreciating that any mile walked strengthens your legs, that the direction you chose may not match the imagined ideal. Self awareness is appreciating that the human mind is capable of any imagination, and few imaginations consider accurately all costs or benefits of reality. Imaginations are powerful, but can cause circling, and are most powerful during the plan. After the plan, use imagination to accomplish it. Before the plan, use imagination to design it. But don’t use imagination during the plan to redesign it, I.e, avoid circling.</p>
<p>Action gets stuff done.</p>

  <title>New business Checklist</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/new-business-checklist.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Getting paid is easy. Getting paid the right way is harder.</p>
<p>You don’t need to have an LLC.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get an address. You can use your own, but safer to pay $10/mo for a postal box. I use Ipostal.com</li>
<li>File an LLC. Use Incfile. Get it done right if you’re doing this business with a partner.</li>
<li>Using the EIN, go register a small business bank account. I chose Chase only because they do</li>
<li>Create a website.</li>
<li>Accounting software (Freshbooks)</li>
<li>On Freshbooks you can connect to strip. You need a website first.</li>
<li>Get an email provider. (Outlook or Google) You don’t need a website to do email, but you do need a domain. You can have anyone host your website, anyone register your name, and anyone do your email. But the company that registers your url will be the place where you manage your DNS records to set up your email.</li>
<li>Track your expenses separately. They’re all a tax write off.
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a separate credit card, perhaps a small business credit card, for just this purpose.</li>
</ol></li>
<li></li>
</ol>

  <title>My Advice for New Career People</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The keys for me for job satisfaction are now pretty basic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is my manager supportive and someone I like spending time with?</li>
<li>Is the work continuously interesting? Will I develop skills that are likely to bring interesting opportunities in the future?</li>
<li>Is there incentive alignment between what I offer and what the company needs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog post will attempt to describe my thoughts on what makes for a fulfilling career. It’s a hard question. Maybe something in here is valuable as you search for your “ideal” career.</p>
<section id="likely-useless-career-advice" class="level1">
<h1>Likely useless career advice</h1>
<p>Now for a stream of consciousness about corporate employment…</p>
<p>Some say a job should help you 1) earn or 2) learn and if neither then leave. But that framework doesn’t really work because you can learn anything anywhere.</p>
<p>Knowledge is accretive. As I look back on jobs I didn’t love, I still learned things. I wasn’t a fan of the type of consulting I was doing 10 years ago, but I’ve now started a consulting firm and having had that experience is helpful. So it’s all kind of gray. I didn’t like pulling weeds as a kid but I’m now pulling weeds as a homeowner so yea, I’m glad I know how to do that.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-life-anyway" class="level1">
<h1>what is life anyway?</h1>
<p>Per <a href="../book-review/guide-to-decision-making.html">Guide to Decision Making</a>, “resulting” may apply if you say you made a good decision because you enjoyed a job. By the same token you made a bad decision because you didn’t enjoy the job.</p>
<p>The reality is that “all or nothing thinking” is more of a cognitive bias, per <a href="../book-review/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.html">The Coddling of the American Mind</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-worry-cure.html">The Worry Cure</a>. And so, you’re going to learn things as long as you’re remotely interested in learning things. Whether they satisfy your <a href="../book-review/the-6-types-of-working-genius.html">Working Genius</a> is another matter.</p>
</section>
<section id="i-want-my-dream-job-though" class="level1">
<h1>I want my “dream” job though</h1>
<p>Can you land your dream job? Or is it a myth? 30-40% of first time marriages end in divorce. And not all of the remaining 70-60% are blissfully happy either. But many of those 70% ARE blissfully happy. Or they will be. Or they were and they will be again maybe or something…</p>
<p>Marriage and work are similar: they’re a type of relationship.</p>
<p>Happiness in a relationship takes both people being committed to the happiness of the other. One sided relationships eventually crumble. But if both people remain committed to the other’s happiness, and other certain caveats…, the marriage will prove valuable to both for their whole lives.</p>
</section>
<section id="professional-and-life-happiness" class="level1">
<h1>Professional and Life happiness</h1>
<p>Happiness to me comes in two forms: doing the best I can with the circumstances I have (the cards I’ve been dealt) and choosing environments that are healthy (the game that gives me the cards).</p>
<p>It’s about 1) what you’re doing and 2) the environment and context you’re doing it in.</p>
<p>This is life. Some games are fun to me. Others less fun by definition. But any game may be better than no game. Unless the game involves a high risk of me breaking my spine. Nuance.</p>
<p>Point is: it takes a long while to find what environments you thrive in. Any company can offer just one or potentially many environments depending on their size or the role.</p>
<p>So if you don’t know what you’re interested in, you must explore. You try.</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-the-best-environment" class="level1">
<h1>Finding the best environment</h1>
<p>First on the environment.</p>
<p>Jane Austen is better at this than me. Take all those sisters in Pride and Prejudice who have varying views on love and stability. Some sisters believe in true love. Others think it’s a myth and instead choose financial stability. Of course true love wins in the end.</p>
<p>I suppose work is very similar: you’re going to get out of it what you believe is possible. After all: you work with and for people.</p>
<p>It will take time and risks to figure out what environments you thrive in, kind of like dating. The interview is part of the process. Bring in a company is another part. Talking to friends in other companies is a third part. Thinking grass is greener is a fourth part, and so forth. That’s life.</p>
<p><em>Your needs</em> also change in your career. As you change, your preferences change. It’s up to you to learn how to match your preferences with your environments, and how to accommodate your preferences within your environments.</p>
<p>If you don’t like your roommate, you can leave early or wait till your contract expires or etc etc. or you can try to work it out and get to know your roommate. All are options. Which you choose is up to you. In the end, a good environment takes two. But it also takes one to instigate change for the better for both. Reciprocity.</p>
</section>
<section id="experiment-your-way-to-a-happy-career" class="level1">
<h1>Experiment Your Way to a Happy Career</h1>
<p>Then there’s the <em>thing you’re doing.</em></p>
<p>You can “try” anything by doing it yourself. Do you want to be a teacher? Go try to volunteer teaching. Do you want to be a coder? Spend 20 hours trying to build an app. Do you want to be a doctor? Volunteer with doctors.</p>
<p>Four ways of learning what you like emerge. The quality of the information is ordered top to bottom while the amount of time it takes to get that information is bottom to top:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading about an industry or job is kind of helpful.</li>
<li>Talking to people in the field is more helpful.</li>
<li>Following and shadowing those people is even more useful.</li>
<li>But actually doing the work is the only way to really know.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read about 50 jobs to see what piques your interest and help you learn what’s out there. Next, you can increase the chance of pursuing a job you like by trying to do it without actually having to get the job.</p>
<p>You can get a pretty good sense by doing little projects similar to what the real work is going to be.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-not-try-something-because-of-a-dumb-reason" class="level1">
<h1>Don’t Not Try Something Because of a Dumb Reason</h1>
<p>A lot of people think they shouldn’t do something because they’re not good enough. Even professionals. (Tiger Woods just had his worst round of his life, but I’m guessing he’s still better than you.)</p>
<p>Or they think they shouldn’t try something because they’re not yet credentialed. “Don’t try this at home kids”. It’s what we’re taught.</p>
<p>And that’s kind of the great myth: the myth of titles and credentials. That you need to be experienced at something to be able to do that thing. But that’s a lie. Instead, you should only pursue the credential if it offers you something you can’t otherwise get (due to red tape). And until you get the credential, you’re just spending a few hours every day learning stuff and maybe passing an exam at the end. So if you ignore the exam, what’s stopping you from just picking up the activities today you may find rewarding?</p>
<p>I once spent a single week shadowing dentists in an open room in Honduras. I was a Spanish translator for these American dentists that came through. I felt pretty confident by the end that I could probably do one of the fillings just because it really wasn’t that complicated. And the dentists told me so. Once you look at 100 cavities in a mouth it’s not hard to spot them. This was the easiest way to de-myth this job: watching and observing.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It was actually really boring. Once you’ve seen 100 cavities you’ve seen them all I think. Glad I figured that out quickly! But I know there’s someone out there that disagrees with me and I’m glad they’ll be drilling my teeth and not me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>90% of most people’s jobs could be taught via apprenticeship, like the good old days. Today’s world of credentials makes people think they’re incapable of doing a pretty simple task: putting a tool into someone’s tooth. But before you invest 8 years of your life in dental school, why not go be a dental hygienist for 1 year? Instead of doing a coding bootcamp, why not just code in your basement for a month after hours? This is the way to find what you like.</p>
<p>Whether you enjoy doing that thing that created value for people can only be discovered by doing it.</p>
</section>
<section id="people-hire-you-because-you-offer-a-service-or-value.-period." class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>People Hire you Because you offer a Service or Value. Period.</h1>
<p>Your real job is to create value for people. It’s not a title. It’s not a credential. It’s not mandated or necessary in society. And if you were born 100 years before today or 100 years after the job may not exist. So think about opportunities in this way.</p>
<p>A healthier way to thinking about corporate life is: what creates value? Is there a reasonable exchange of goods for my offering?</p>
<p>I’m capable of many offerings. But they’re hiring for one offering. That’s life.</p>
<p>If I were selling apricots, and someone was offering me peanuts, would I exchange my apricots for their peanuts? Well, if we were the only two people sure.</p>
<p>But maybe I feel like I can get some avocados for my apricots. So can I find an avocado dealer? Do they even like apricots? Do they already have enough apricots? And if yes to all the above, are they even in the mood to exchange for apricots today? Lastly, do they like me?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-exchange-of-goods.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Work is just an exchange of goods</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Getting a job is more of a negotiation than anything. And everything in work is a negotiation. Read <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> and that becomes quite apparent. Work is nothing fancy. It’s not a title. It’s not a degree. It’s just doing little activities.</p>
<p>And after you’ve 1000 similar activities you’re soon labeled a data scientist or a farmer. And if you circled the right boxes on an exam and got a piece of paper you’re now a doctor/dentist. But the paper or the title don’t make you good at that thing. My point: create value, not titles.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-sum" class="level1">
<h1>In Sum</h1>
<p>So yes. I’ve gone on a rant here. But hey this is my blog. I’m trying to talk about the deeper issues at how to choose a profession or a company within that profession. I’m trying to break away from the titles and credentials that blind our thinking away from the more important questions of “what activities bring me joy” and “how will I know it?” And “will someone pay me for doing this activity?” And “how do I find an environment of people that will enable me to do valuable activities and make it a pleasant place to work?” (PS, some say to not work for <a href="../book-review/elon-musk.html">Elon Musk</a>…unless you enjoy his working style.)</p>
<p>Long story short: make sure the company hiring you actually needs your skills to run their business. Strive to find better opportunities by putting yourself out there and trying new things. And find people you like working with. All the rest is just a bonus.</p>
<p>The most dangerous thing is to get all those good things on your first job because then you try to self actualize per Maslov’s hierarchy of needs. “Don’t it always seem to go That you don’t know what you got ’til it’s gone?” (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big+yellow+taxi+lyrics&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-ca&amp;client=safari&amp;si=AKbGX_rdaVK-rhf5KHnOAD2drrRmADv7R3TkES869sRtvhJtAOFIxRuJ9oGiG6TvSdbxEwjlbUdo-jivJcsfmZzA84yEzB3d-vLGFPTy5juD3yV4riCQxI1XJ6ZQGPnEjGqh-qYE7AaZxecxMD6ZV9wfd6ykO8ZaKA%3D%3D&amp;ictx=1&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi176q45LuFAxVsKkQIHdMLBT4QjukCegQIIxAE">Lyrics</a>) So if you get a “bad” job just know it’s part of the process and one day 10 years from now you’ll probably be grateful you had that job anyway.</p>
<p>If I didn’t actually answer your questions that’s because some questions are a perennial debate. Some popular people hate the idea of work-life balance, some embrace it. Go figure. And keep searching to find someone who sees work and career the same way you do, because there are millions of jobs in the work. Hundreds of millions.</p>
</section>
<section id="books-to-read" class="level1">
<h1>Books to read</h1>
<p>It helps to get perspective when choosing where you want to work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a> - have a decision framework</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/the-6-types-of-working-genius.html">The 6 Types of Working Genius</a> - understand who you are.</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/overcoming-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team.html">Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team</a> - it helps to recognize a good company by first understanding a bad company.</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a> - a job is a job at the end of the day. It’s just fishing.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="practical-questions" class="level1">
<h1>Practical Questions</h1>
<p>Things I’d think about in your shoes:</p>
<ul>
<li>what loosely sounds interesting? Who perhaps knows someone with that type of role? How do I get 15 min with that person, or a quick email? (Use 6 degrees of separation to your advantage)</li>
<li>do I have an ideal salary? What’s realistic? (Levels.fyi, don’t over or undersell yourself. Figure out market rates and if your job will support your desired lifestyle in a location)</li>
<li>what’s the entry level job that gets me some experience 50% in the right direction that I’m interested in?</li>
<li>where will I learn?</li>
<li>Does this company offer flexibility to try new things?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes job searching is helped by thinking by contrast:</p>
<ul>
<li>what can someone not pay me $500k per year to do? $300k? $100k? (Nobody could pay me $500k to be an investment banker and work 100 hour weeks. Maybe they could pay me $2M and I’d do it for 2 years ya know? But $500 isn’t enough.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you’re interviewing:</p>
<ul>
<li>what incentivizes people on a daily basis?</li>
<li>will this job be around in 2 years? Why? Why not? Why might they fire me in 6 months for things 100% outside of my control? (Recessions, business strategy shifts, etc)</li>
<li>how essential is my skillset to what they do?</li>
<li>what relationship do people have with my would-be manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to potentially ask your hiring manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you see me fitting into this role?</li>
<li>Why might this role not be a good fit for me?</li>
<li>Who’s the highest ranking person who’s quit or been fired recently and why?</li>
<li>How do you define success for this role?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to ask your peers you’re interviewing with:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe your relationship with your manager?</li>
<li>describe the communication patterns of the team?</li>
<li>describe how decisions are made? What’s a recent decision that was made? describe your role in how the team made that decision?</li>
</ul>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>

  <title>How to Sign in with iCloud Calendar on Outlook for iOS</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/how-to-sign-in-with-icloud-calendar-on-outlook-for-ios.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>How do I add an iCloud account to iOS Outlook without it being a public calendar?</p>
<p>It was easy to add any gmail accounts but I didn’t know how to add my iCloud calendar to iOS Outlook. Part of the issue is my iCloud account is actually my gmail email address so I can’t sign in with this or it’ll load my gmail calendar.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to iOS settings &gt; iCloud &gt; get your <code>@icloud.com</code> name. If you use your gmail account for iCloud there’s still this <code>@icloud</code> account.</li>
<li>Attempt to log into iOS Outlook calendar. Apple will then make you create an app-specific password for iOS Outlook</li>
<li>Use this password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Done. Pain solved.</p>

<p><a href="../book-review/beyond-band-of-brothers.html">Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters</a></p>
<p>Leadership from the bayonette. 10 points of leadership by dick winters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strive to be a leader of character, competence, and courage.</li>
<li>Lead from the front. Say, “Follow me!” and then lead the way.</li>
<li>Stay in top physical shape—physical stamina is the root of mental toughness.</li>
<li>Develop your team. If you know your people, are fair in setting realistic goals and expectations, and lead by example, you will develop teamwork.</li>
<li>Delegate responsibility to your subordinates and let them do their jobs. You can’t do a good job if you don’t have a chance to use your imagination or your creativity.</li>
<li>Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don’t wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind.</li>
<li>Remain humble. Don’t worry about who receives the credit. Never let power or authority go to your head.</li>
<li>Take a moment of self-reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself if you did your best.</li>
<li>True satisfaction comes from getting the job done. The key to a successful leader is to earn respect—not because of rank or position, but because you are a leader of character.</li>
<li>Hang tough!—Never, ever give up.</li>

  <title>A Costly Mistake</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“This is the moment I’ve been waiting for”…until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Several years ago as a budding data scientist I got excited by using a massive compute cluster. This is it. This is when I get to do Big Data Science, baby!</p>
<p>A few thousand dollars later, I realized my hundred-dollar-an-hour cluster wasn’t doing the thing I hired it to do.</p>
<p>My patient manager David Mantilla ssh’d into my cluster and discovered that out of the 64 cores I paid for, I was using only 1.</p>
<p>A good manager goes a long way. He just laughed as I stared in horror at my gross misconduct.</p>
<p>Be kind to the noobs. Because you still are one in many ways…</p>

  <title>Implementing Culture</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/implementing-culture.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>One of the most important asset a company wields is its culture.</p>
<p>A culture is hard to define, but you know it when you see it. It’s the collective personality and written and unwritten rules of engagement. Since corporate employment is a social contract of two at-will parties, the culture emerges from the rules of conduct in which the employer is satisfied with continuing employment of the employee.</p>
<p>Values are lip service without implementation. Assume your company has the value “be kind”. Everyone has a different interpretation of what that means to them.</p>
<p>How do you know what a good culture is? People know the values of the culture and can highlight practices examples of it. The culture should live naturally, but also mechanically. Meaning, an employee will be kind while holding the door open for someone (be kind), but also provide explicit growth-oriented feedback.</p>
<p>Signs of a bad culture are therefore evident in the opposite of my definition. Like Lord of the Flies, employees are fending for survival and constantly exploring the boundaries because there are now rules of government. Employees that can’t recount what the values are or demonstrate how the company mechanically employs them are hoping for natural demonstration but get confused when they get mixed signals.</p>
<p>Toxic cultures can achieve financial success. “Toxic” has no concrete definition, but probably reveals people trying to survive on the island rather than thrive in a civilization. It stands, therefore, that a great culture will endure the battles of business, and come out tighter. At some point it won’t matter how bright your people are, how clever your IP is, or how many customers you have: culture is the rudder.</p>

  <title>Nothing to Lose</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/nothing-to-lose.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There was a moment when I had everything to lose. When I was junior in high school, I was scared I’d be cut from the lacrosse team. There was only one coach and he didn’t have space for everybody. Coach held try outs.</p>
<p>My dad was traveling the week of try outs. I gave him a call. “What if I don’t make the team?”</p>
<p>He waits till I finish. And in a way characteristic of my Dad, he re-emphasizes the question. “<em>What</em> if? You go out there, you play your hardest, you give it your all. The rest is out of your hands. If you get cut, you get cut.”</p>
<p>He didn’t give me false praise or reassurance. He gave me perspective on life. He gave me “nothing to lose.”</p>
<p>I never worked harder in my athletics than that week. I just didn’t want to get cut.</p>
<p>Well, I passed try outs. So did everyone else because it was just a coaching trick to motivate us…but that’s beside the point. But my dad’s advice was never lost on me.</p>
<p>I had low confidence the whole season. Yet my coach took a surprising interest in me. I got playing time as a junior. I was a part time defender.</p>
<p>Little did I know, nor could I ever have imagined as a defender who could barely pass or catch, that in my coach’s last game, I would be sitting on the wrong side of the field. I would be standing, as a defender, right in front of the opposing team’s goalie crease. I’m not quite sure how I got there as the whole season I always sprinted off the field whenever we transitioned from defense to offense.</p>
<p>My coach always yelled at me. “Stay on the field!! It’s a fast break!” But I was always terrified of dropping the ball. I was great at defense. Great at scooping the ball. Great at passing it to an offender. This was my safe place.</p>
<p>Yet here I was, in the final minutes of the game. We had three, they had five. And I’m on the crease. What was I doing here?</p>
<p>My eyes and voice called to my teammate who saw me. My teammate who knew full well I had no intention of actually catching the ball. My teammate who would love to pass it to me if he had any assurance I’d actually catch it. I could see his eyes lock with mine and it only takes 8 years playing a sport to recognize that split-second glance, “Are you going to actually catch this?” My eyes asserted in that moment with my stick extended and ready “I really don’t know. But I’m wide open and I’m on the crease. And you have the defender and not me. So make a call.”</p>
<p>To my surprise he actually passed it. It didn’t have to be a just perfunctory vanity motion to please the coach. Because I’ve called for the ball many times in that wrote script, “oh please pass it I swear it’s worth all our time okay I did my thing now you guys go score because I’m outta here!”</p>
<p>I catch. I turn. I dunk. 4-5.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>I asked Teddy later why he actually passed it to me. “I figured, what the heck? Maybe he’ll catch it!!” We both laughed. He had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>I didn’t know it then, but it was the last goal anybody would score for my coach. It was the last game of the season. The last game of his 35 year career at our school. I was wholly undeserving.</p>
<p>And that’s when you stand most to gain.</p>

  <title>Personal Constitution</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/personal-constitution.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="preamble" class="level1">
<h1>Preamble</h1>
<p>In the spirit of the book <a href="../book-review/principles.html">Principles</a>, with a goal toward increased productivity through self-awareness and accountability, I cement here a personal constitution. I publish this publicly for all to read that I might benefit from their feedback.</p>
</section>
<section id="foundational-principles" class="level1">
<h1>Foundational Principles</h1>
<p><strong>Improvement through self awareness</strong>. As perhaps <a href="../book-review/socrates-a-life-worth-living.html">Socrates</a> said, “an unexamined life is not worth living”. To add my own twist: an examined life refines what’s worth living for. Like a chef with a fine palette, a self awareness acquired through reading, personal coaching, cognitive therapy, and above all journaling and hearing yourself talk, refines</p>
<p><strong>Trust thyself: I can’t grow unless I test my opinions.</strong> “Success&nbsp;in life is the&nbsp;result of good judgment.&nbsp;Good judgment&nbsp;is usually the&nbsp;result of experience.&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;is usually the&nbsp;result of bad judgment.” <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/tony-robbins-quotes/">Tony Robbins</a> Alberto Savoia teaches in <a href="../book-review/the-right-it.html">The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeeds</a> the YODA framework - Your Own DAta. Only your own data is trustworthy. Intuition gets me to the point of knowing what data I need to collect. After intuition, there’s my opinion about what might happen, someone else’s opinion about what might happen, someone else’s data, and my own data. With limited time and the infeasability of collecting omniscient data (discussed in <a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a> (Annie Duke)), I want to collect as much data as I can from other people’s mistakes by reading and learning. My value to the world, however, will come when I recognize that for a problem at hand that there is either data gathered via the Aristotlean methold of empirical evidence or Socratic method of reasoning by degrees. Judgment is used to determine whether data is worth being collected. In absence of data, “If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine.” Jim Barksdale, CEO of Netscape (<a href="../book-review/trustworthy-online-controlled-experiments-a-practical-guide-to-ab-testing.html">Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing</a>). I will be unafraid to share my opinion, even if perceived as stupid or wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Assume Kindness, Give Kindness, Give and Seek Forgiveness.</strong> In a multi-cultural world, it’s hard to know what word might offend someone. I learned this by learning “Honduran” Spanish. The word for “Wednesday” in one culture might be a curse word in another. Inadvertantly, if I’m to share an opinion with the best of intentions, I may offend someone unwittingly due to the way I shared it or the way they interpreted it. Everyone communicates differently. Assume kindness means to assume they don’t intend harm. Give kindness means to speak with good intention. Giving and seeking forgiveness is the process of recognizing that in assuming or giving kindness, I’ll fall short but I can recover and let things go. Regardless of culture, we’re all human and want good feelings. We can operate in a way that cultivates these good feelings - a universal language.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerability is recognizing weakness, which is the foundation of true, enduring strength</strong>. As discussed in <a href="../book-review/dare-to-lead.html">Dare to Lead</a> and <a href="../book-review/overcoming-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team.html">Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team</a>, teams fail when they’re not vulnerable, vulnerable in the sense that they’re self aware to share their strengths and weaknesses and ask for help in their weaknesses. A toxic environment is one that fails to recognize weakness, because like a limp knee that causes first hip, then shoulder issues appear. A powerful Christian teaching states, “I&nbsp;give&nbsp;unto men weakness that they may be humble;…for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make&nbsp;weak&nbsp;things become strong unto them.” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p27#p27">Ether 12:27</a>). From this point of view, weakness is actually a gift. It’s a gift to rely on God (in my opinion, which is most often found in the goodness and grace of others) and ask for help. The Alcoholics Anonymous group recognizes the power of asking for help.</p>
</section>
<section id="principled-behaviors" class="level1">
<h1>Principled Behaviors</h1>
<p><strong>Opinions deserve to be dissected, and everyone is filled with biases.</strong> <strong>Challenging Opinions: Put out opinions, and challenge others’</strong>: “Strong opinions, loosely held” is a mantra in tech and means something different to everyone. I interpret this as “everyone <em>has</em> an opinion, most choose to let the most dominant opinion run the conversation”. “strong” means you recognize you actually do have an opinion, even if you don’t care. By sharing an opinion, you’re putting it out there to be challenged. Being willing to change it with new evidence is “loosely-held”. It’s demonstrated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY73exaVpyw">Elon Musk</a> changing his opinion of how to design Starship while talking to a reporter. Speak, be open to challenges, and adjust. If I don’t challenge opinions, I’m at risk of “I told you so” syndrome later, except you didn’t tell them and instead you inflate your internal ego and did nothing to solve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge theory, challenge data collection.</strong> As discussed in <a href="../book-review/scientific-freedom.html">Scientific Freedom</a> (Donald Braben), peer review is dying and failing the scientific process. As discussed in <a href="../book-review/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.html">The Coddling of the American Mind</a> (Jonathan Haidt,&nbsp;Greg Lukianoff), cancel culture is crushing open and free discussion, opinions and movements usually driven by cognitive distortions. As demonstrated in <a href="../book-review/the-quest-for-cosmic-justice.html">The Quest for Cosmic Justice</a> (Thomas Sowell), there is usually strong contra-evidence to very dogmatic political beliefs about “how things should be”. If we reason with evidence like Sowell, challenge our beliefs like Haidt/Lukianoff, and seek to establish real, empirical truth like Braben, we’ll approach problems like <a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">Duke</a> by considering all possibilitys, evaluating costs, and challenging internal biases. Data collection is difficult, and the procedures by which you collect data and draw conclusiosn from it must be challenged so that inferences can</p>
<p><strong>If I have an issue I’ll bring it to the problem first.</strong> If I have a conflict (see next section) with someone, I seek to resolve it behind closed doors first. It takes two people to resolve a conflict. If the conflict cannot be resolved behind closed doors, or repeatedly re-occurs despite my best efforts, I’ll proceed to a more defensive stance, which often resolves in me processing it through journaling.</p>
<p><strong>If I sense an issue, I seek to reassure those around me.</strong> I’ve been in several great organizations, and several toxic organizations. Once, 2 weeks after joining a team I interviewed everyone on the team. I could tell immediately that 6/12 were incredibly dissatisfied even if they didn’t say it. One of them went so far as to tell me they hated their boss. Within a year, 5/12 had left the team to go somewhere else in the org. On another occassion, I joined a team and within one week of joining, one person asked me to unionize. Again, a lot of discord. Within 6 weeks 10 of the 20 data scientists in the company were fired, including the disgruntled. In a third cirucmstance, a lot of disgruntled employees foment amongst themselves, each trying to solve their problems with management. Management doesn’t recognize even direct requests for changes in behavior. In all three of these circumstances, I work quickly to bring up the issues. I speak directly with management. I speak in the first person, keeping confidences, and only doing so usually at my own personal risk. I try to resolve what I have experienced, and what I have control over. Sometimes, people don’t want to change. Usually this results in failed organizations, but not always. In all three of these circumstances, I have witness failed organizations. The first was in a large organization where the manager got a horrible “do not recommend” rating from their peers. The second was an organization that lost all of its remaining data science talent. The third was an organization that lost multiple long-tenured teammates, even key leaders, that went on to get top jobs at other top companies. Belief: if talent gets a great job at a great company elsewhere, the company is doing something wrong.</p>

<section id="my-conflict-style" class="level1">
<h1>My Conflict Style</h1>
<p>Conflict, to me, isn’t a dirty word if two people have good intentions. It becomes dirty when both parties have bad intentions. It’s at its worst when one has good intentions and the other has bad.</p>
<p>As the youngest child of peaceful parents, my conflict style is to observe and self-reflect.</p>

<h1>How I’ll Fail</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>After doing a ton of work on myself, I’ve grown to an awareness of how I operate. There are past scars.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve been fired before.</strong> This leads</p>
<p>I hyperfocus on the negative.</p>

  <title>Trajectory and Mindset</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/trajectory-and-mindset.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tony Robbins has said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are. <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/tony-robbins-quotes/">Tony Robbins Quotes, Read These Famous Quotes from Tony Robbins</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book <a href="../book-review/mindset.html">Mindset</a> talks about “fixed” vs “growth” mindsets. My post <a href="../posts/decisions-are-rivers.html">Decisions are Like Hopping on a River Raft</a> - decisions take you down to known endpoints.</p>
<p>Bring those two concepts together and on one hand there’s a trajectory - where you’re capable of going given your decisions (and mindset) and your mindset - how you perceive your circumstances.</p>
<p>Someone recently told me, “It’s not what you go through but how you perceive what you’re going through that matters.”</p>
<p>I believe perception is powerful. Any negative situation can be reframed for a positive. This is mindset.</p>
<p>But the other component is also important: where your circumstances will take you if pursued every day for the next 30 years.</p>

</div>
<p>If you’re an extremely happy person but you don’t take action to get out of a minimum wage job, such as spend time on self improvement, you’re going to stay in your minimum wage job (nothing wrong with that, just trying to illustrate a point).</p>
<p>And so, to get what you want out of life you can’t just assume things will get better without any change on your part. You can 1) change your mindset or 2) change your trajectory.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered whether at times in my career I was complacent or not, or whether I was growing doing what I was doing. That’s not a helpful question. Because if you’re too myopic you can miss that you doing your multiplication tables isn’t going to change anyone’s life, but if you can’t do multiplication you can’t be a machine learning engineer.</p>
<p>Most days in our work are steps. Steps towards something.</p>
<p>A spaceman can’t land on the moon unless they build a rocket. They won’t make a rocket unless they choose to land on the moon. And by choosing the moon they’re choosing to <em>not</em> open a Chinese restaurant.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Some roles have upper bounds. Staying at that upper bound isn’t a bad thing. It’s just a thing. Other roles open up different opportunities the longer you stick around, opportunities you won’t get else where perhaps.</p>
<p>So if you’re feeling stuck, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will I be if I stay with this for the next two years?</li>
<li>Is that directionally where I want now to head?</li>
<li>Is there something about my mindset I can change today to help me reframe so that I don’t miss the opportunities already around me?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTH.</p>

<p>I once played a game of pickup basketball with my football captain. He was a linebacker. All state. And got drafted to play in college. He was an incredible athlete.</p>
<p>But he moved like a clunky robot while playing basketball and couldn’t make a layup for his life.</p>
<p>Sometimes that’s how we are. As leaders, we should aim to help find where the misfits thrive.</p>

  <title>World’s Longest Drive</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/worlds-longest-drive.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There’s a fun $75,000 purse for the winner of the World’s Longest Drive.</p>
<p>These guys are averaging 400y in contest, which is an attempt to drive straight. This guy wins (ofc) but his first round is the best. 432.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gv3YACYV648?si=jXXsfxfHxpmcpHFZ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Apparently the record is 515 set in 1974 by Mike Austin, a 64 year old.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s kind of crazy that since 1974 the record for longest drive hasn’t been broken.</li>
<li>Tech helps, but old school can sometimes be the way. Form over gear all day.</li>

<p>But Berkshire broke that record per his Instagram account. Here’s the full scoop:</p>

<p>Hemingway introduced through his writing style the <a href="https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2023/1/1646.pdf">Iceberg Theory</a>. It was something I noticed while reading <a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a>. You feel the depth of emotion from the “actions and dialogue”, rather than explicit descriptions.</p>
<p>It’s fun to contrast that with <a href="../concepts/frank-herbert.html">Frank Herbert</a>’s style which is “lay out the environment, have dialogue, then draw conclusions in the mind”.</p>
<p>Both styles speak to the thought that the writing is more interesting the less you write about. They call this “negative space” in drawing. A sketch is interesting when the mind can fill in the gaps. As an artist, you just want to make enough dots that they can connect them themselves. This connecting process is the freedom and interest the mind craves. It doesn’t want to be coddled (<a href="../book-review/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.html">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>).</p>
<p>Back to the book. The Old Man and the Sea can be summarized in one sentence: a tired, old, and recently-unlucky man catches the biggest of his life and it gets eaten before he makes it home.</p>
<p>That’s the surface story, and it’s rather boring when thought of that way. But you just <em>feel</em> so much while reading it. You feel for the old man through the young boy. You feel for him as he teeters between passing out and existing. You remember the breaking points in your own life and want the man desperately to succeed. Luck, however, was not on his side.</p>
<p>“Talk less. Smile more.” - Hamilton</p>

  <title>The Compounding Interest of Reading</title>

<p>I’m on my way to get 52 books read this year. I think I can do it.</p>
<p>But it’s not to finish 52 books. It’s to read two hours of fifty two books. Why?</p>
<p>Because of compounding interest. One book doesn’t level you up. But multiple books over time will affect you for a long while to come.</p>
<p>If you improve just 1% each day for 365 days, and that improvement compounds, then you’ll have improved 37x over a year. (invest $100 and gain 1% each day and reinvest that money is $137 by the end of the year).</p>
<p>So don’t worry what any one book gives you. Just keep investing. A few will pay off big, and the many “wasted” will have little downside.</p>

  <title>Easiest ways to learn something</title>

<p>The easiest ways to learn how do to something better:</p>
<ul>
<li>do something for the first time</li>
<li>Do something 1000 times. You get better over time.</li>
<li>Mess up doing something: this is how you realize your initial assumptions were wrong and you overcome beginners luck.</li>
<li>Do something fast: You see what you do more efficiently.</li>
<li>Do the same thing with new inputs: serve a new customer, try on new shoes for walking.</li>
<li>Watch someone do the same thing you’ve done 50 times: you have all the context and you’re primed to observe new ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is life experience, it turns out. Doing a lot of stuff on repeat, watching others do it, mess up doing it, or do it slightly differently…</p>

  <title>Reading Charts Every Week</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The hardest thing about looking at charts is the “nothings changed” bias our minds are prone to. It requires a ton of energy to look at each chart with new eyes every time.</p>
<p>This is actually where AI can help point out things. But then there’s the fatigue of starting to ignore AI read outs.</p>
<p>Then move to anomaly detection</p>
<p>But what if there are always a ton of anomalies.</p>
<p>Then go back and make sure you read every chart. Every week.</p>

  <title>Expertise is knowing what to do when things go wrong</title>

<p>Expertise isn’t knowing how to do something right. It’s knowing how to make it right when things go wrong.</p>
<p>I shadowed a dentist for a week as a hygienist. I was pretty confident by the end that filling a cavity was actually the pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>But what about that one time you hit a nerve? Or take too much off? Or…or…</p>

  <title>How I will vote</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/how-i-will-vote.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2016 I voted independent with the hope that I could have neither Trump nor Hilary. I lived in Virginia, a somewhat swing state, and had a chance of creating an electoral college lock.</p>
<p>In 2020 I voted independent because I wanted to give a third party a viable say, and I knew that a democrat would earn my delegate votes anyway. (Californian republicans have a say in the house, not the senate or the Oval Office.) a state that has only voted <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/California">Democrat since 1988</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img2024-09-01-2109-republican-b.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This is interesting because they’ve had multiple tepiblican</p>

  <title>Scientific method</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/scientific-method.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I use these seven steps to the scientific method every single day:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What’s the problem?</li>
<li>Hypothesis: What’s the believed answer?</li>
<li>Metrics: how do I measure with data?</li>
<li>Methods: how do I test the belief?</li>
<li>Findings: what are the unemotional facts?</li>
<li>Discussion: what are my opinions about the findings? (These are usually more hypotheses.)</li>
<li>Next steps: self explanatory 🤣</li>
</ol>
<p>It helps me think more clearly when diving into data! Hope it helps.</p>

  <title>This is an A/B test</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Dude. You’re being experimented on. Aren’t you a little bit curious how it works?</p>
<p>Bruh, they’re experimenting on you. Yes you. Now. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p>Im A/B testing out some clickbait, let’s see if it works 👇👇</p>
<p>This post is not AI generated. I wrote it. But I’m testing an idea: what if I write and publish two posts at the exact same time but with different clickbait hooks? Same content (what I’m writing here.)</p>
<p>Hypothesis: I’m guessing LinkedIn will naturally favor one post over the other. Hard to know which.</p>
<p>A/B testing is all about this every day. Newspapers play with their bylines. Search engines play with their titles. Ad copy is all one massive experiment to see what clicks the most.</p>
<p>So drop a like if you like A/B tests. And keep an eye out for my other identical post, launched at 10am on Tuesday PST. Let’s see which gets the more impressions on LinkedIn!</p>
<p>Here are the two intros:</p>

  <title>Data science structure</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/data-science-structure.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Over my career I’ve thought a lot about “where should a data scientist sit in an org?” 👇 5 lessons from what I’ve learned after working in 6 very different companies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>DS under an MBA: maybe okay, probably bound for failure.</li>
<li>DS under the PM: def bound for failure.</li>
<li>DS under the DS: good for the junior in the short term.</li>
<li>DS under Eng: good.</li>
<li>DS under a people manager, but works closely integrated team with a DS-experiences tech lead: best.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interdisciplinary teams do the best work. It maximizes labor efficiency to have engineers, PMs, and DS’s working on the same problem but doing different things.</p>
<p>When you federate DS, they don’t care as much about what they’re working on. The incentives are off.</p>
<p>When a DS works for a PM the PM will make wild assumptions about what they should do. PMs oversimplify problems and DS find that unsatisfying.</p>
<p>DS reporting to DS means you throw stuff over the fence and the Eng do the real work. And the Eng don’t capture all the nuance the DS would like to implement.</p>
<p>DS reporting to business types is unfulfilling because DS love technical stuff.</p>
<p>best scenario? Have a DS work in a pod with experienced tech leads. DS reports (HR purposes) to someone outside of the team who can give them guidance but is incapable of micromanaging them.</p>

  <title>10 steps to optimize anything</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/10-steps-to-optimize-anything.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I love-hate goal setting. Here are 10 steps I often fail at in how I try to breakdown and achieve goals, but hey, this is LinkedIn so I’ll share…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Objective: Define your “where you are going” and your “why”.</li>
<li>Principles: Decide what’s worth it in how you pursue your where/why.</li>
<li>Key Result: Measure the goal numerically 1-3 ways. Too many is too confusing.</li>
<li>KR-Drivers: Identify the key drivers that affect the goal.</li>
<li>Hypothesize: Use data/intuition to guess what will drive increases in KR-drivers.</li>
<li>Experiment: Try 2 approaches, manipulate the drivers in big or minor ways.</li>
<li>Track: Measure/track/Log what’s needed to measure if your hypothesis was valid or rejected.</li>
<li>Analyze: make minor tweaks in the drivers and measure statistically significant changes.</li>
<li>Conclude: Which direction will increase your KR. Consider alternate paths if the experiment didn’t yield good results.</li>
<li>Periodic Evaluation: At a pre-determined cadence (1 wk, 6 wk, quarter), choose if your KR is helping you achieve your objective.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>A few lessons learned as a professional experimenter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking is not the key result. Don’t confuse them. Too many people&nbsp;&nbsp;track habits for no reason (I’m guilty of this 100%)</li>
<li>KR’s have no purpose if you don’t have an objective. You want 100k ffollowers? 100k revenue? They don’t mean anything until you know what you’re going to do with it. More fame/money doesn’t equal more life satisfaction. Lots of unhappy/depressed rich/famous people.</li>
<li>“Experimentation” early into defining a product should be massive swings. Find the “lowest hanging fruit”, make the biggest changes.</li>
<li>Have principles to guide your KR’s. If you don’t</li>
<li>Have Anti-KR’s - things you won’t do. This is the hardest. If you have 10 KR’s, perhaps KR’s 2-10 should be all anti-KR’s. Otherwise, you’ll get distracted on 2 despite you knowing 1 is most important.</li>
<li>A rising tide lifts all ships: By improving one KR, you may be sacrificing improving another. But more likely you’ll actually improve all KR’s, because they’re usually correlated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy Example: “I want to be healthier”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Objective: I want more energy to be able to devote it to my kids.</p></li>
<li><p>Principles:&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>I will not hurt my body by doing unnecessary XYZ</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not going to kill myself. I’m going to keep this simple.</p></li>
<li><p>KR:&nbsp;&nbsp;(Write down 10, pick the one that will obviate the rest)</p></li>
<li><p>Gain 10 lbs of muscle</p></li>
<li><p>Eat 100g of protein a day</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep 8 hours a day</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate 20 minutes a day</p></li>
<li><p>KR-drivers for gaining 10 lbs of muscle:</p></li>
<li><p>Lift weights</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on quads</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on upper body</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesize: If I go to the gym for 10 minutes for 28 days and do 30 exercises a day, I’ll gain muscle.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment: I’ll keep my diet the same - including the popcorn. I’ll focus my mental energy on clearing my calendar and getting out the door to the gym. The “control” experiment is what I’ve done the last 28 days…not worked out 🤣</p></li>
<li><p>Track:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Day 1: I’ll weight myself, write a journal about how I feel. Perhaps ask myself some questions.</li>
<li>Did I go to the gym for 10 minutes? I’ll keep a piece of paper and a pen taped to my mirror or on my nightstand. Checkbox. Don’t track anything else. This is my one focus right now.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Analyze: on day 28, I’ll weigh myself again.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Conclude: Did this 28-day challenge change how I felt? Be honest: it might not. Perhaps I can get on my bike, or hike, or do pushups every day instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodic evaluation: every 2 months I’ll investigate how my energy is.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>your goal isn’t to gain/lose weight. Your goal is to feel better about your health. Your key result is a number on a scale going up/down.</p>

  <title>Reading this Daily</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>#SundayThoughts Six weeks ago I stopped listening to podcasts in the morning and started listening to The Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Perhaps this book doesn’t do it for you. If so, there are other scriptures or ancient philosophy texts that teach good principles. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is a good one.</p>
<p>Listening to this timeless, ancient book every day has helped center me. It’s reminded me of God’s timetable. Of God’s intervention in the course of human nature. And of God’s unending love for us as His children.</p>
<p>How do I listen? I picked a theme: Revelation. I took notes every day on what the 10-30 minutes taught me about that theme. Now I’m working on the theme of “patience”.</p>
<p>Having this more-constant anchor in my life helps me remember what’s important each day. I feel a little bit more confidence and centered perspective each day I start with this practice.</p>

<p>Solid read: https://markmanson.net/attention-diet Over the last year I had read a few things similar to the points here and went on an “low information” diet (Tim Ferriss quote?).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I don’t miss the global news. It only got me angry.</p></li>
<li><p>The point of learning something is to take action and create positive change in the world. If I learn about things I don’t plan to take action on,</p></li>
<li><p>if that sounds uneducated, another reason to learn something is to gain empathy and change my perspective. However, the global news is generally biased by the wars for subscriptions between a handful of editors.</p></li>
<li><p>Niche news is far more educative. I’ve subscribed to blogs, to specific influencers in my field, etc. I’ve learned things from these people that I can apply that day in my job. I’m subscribing to things that feed my career.</p></li>
<li><p>long form content is far better way to understand current events. If you want to understand the state of the world, read a book on it. Most major geopolitical events are insanely complicated and cannot be surmised in 126 characters. Read a few books on the things you care about.</p></li>
<li><p>there’s so much thought put into even a low quality book. Think about it: most books get reviewed by editors in the very least. They probably get read once or twice at least by the original authors. So what would be a better time for your energy - a low quality book or a set of posts on LinkedIn likely generated by ChatGPT or Jasper.ai? If a low quality book &gt; than a tweet, surely 30 min a day of a high quality book (easy to find) is worth more than most low quality content.</p></li>
<li><p>I broke my iPhone in 2020 and waited 45 days for a replacement. But it wasn’t fully broken - the screen was hopelessly shattered on the bottom half where typing is required. So I kept it in my drawer and only used it when I needed to. The risk of using it? Getting a shard of glass stuck in my finger. I wish I still had that to some degree because it forced me to be focused. I realized very few people texted me anything urgent that couldn’t wait a few days. I could still call people with Siri, but nobody called. We’re optimized to be addicted. That’s literally the goal of these phones and the apps on them. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just not in our best interest.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried using a junk $40 replacement phone I found in my closet while waiting those 45 days to get my iPhone replacement. The phone was from 2015 when I got married - it was a teaser phone from the cell company. It probably downloaded at 2 mbp/s. Any time I clicked a link I had to wait 15-20 seconds for the page to load.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I was amazed. I was shocked this piece of junk actually could take notes. Could email. Could browse the internet. But I also learned not to click on things unless it was worth 30 seconds of my time.</p>
<p>How do I spend my time now? Not wisely enough. A lot of things should be done on a computer. Most things should be planned. Few things are urgent. Fewer are essential.</p>

  <title>A Treatise on Agency and Goals</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/a-treatise-on-agency-and-goals.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I may have ADHD to some degree, I’m not sure. These thoughts came to me today when considering my side business.</p>
<hr>
<section id="a-treatise-on-desire-uncertainty-commitment-and-execution-toward-a-goal." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-treatise-on-desire-uncertainty-commitment-and-execution-toward-a-goal.">A treatise on desire, uncertainty, commitment, and execution toward a goal.</h2>
<p>Descartes proposed that if you pick a direction and walk in a straight line you’ll eventually leave the forest. This assumes you want to leave the forest.</p>
<p>A desire is a persistent yearning. Desires take root and, when nurtured, become reality.</p>
<p>An achieved desire is a blend of hope, faith, and charity. A hope (goal) is the edge of the forest. Walking is faith (belief + action). Charity is long suffering and persistence - the ability to maintain hope and faith.</p>
<p>A hope is envisioned or observed. If observed, there is believed certainty in achievement, with uncertainty in the path. An envisioned hope has uncertainty in both the path and the outcome. You might die trying. Envisioned hopes are impossible only when the path is not made clear. Thought makes the path clear.</p>
<p>A clear path is a plan. A plan is a sequence of informed choices and actions leading towards a goal, a consequence. A causal effect. Reconnaissance is the finite time and energy spent collecting information. Reason invites spending time and energy proportional to the cost or impact of the plan and goal. Judgment determines which choices and actions are taken.</p>
<p>Commitment is recognizing many roads lead to Rome, and only one of them can be walked to actually get there.</p>
<p>Luck is unknown things. Some things could have been known with more reconnaissance. Other things could never have been known or anticipated. Luck either enables or disables the path. Luck happens post plan, post deliberation. It’s the unknown distance between you and the forest’s edge. Hindsight bias is the present mind’s ability to mistakenly believe uncertainty was always certain. “I should have known” is an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Enabling luck makes possible the goal. Disabling luck makes difficult the goal, perhaps impossible. Impossible is usually a state of mind or the laws of physics, but usually never both.</p>
<p>Tilt is the mist of blindness caused by the presence of luck. Tilt distracts from information and commitment, a bias caused by observed outcomes that were previously uncertain.</p>
<p>Commitment is time and energy. Time is measured by rotations of the earth or attempts made. Energy is measured by willingness to roll the dice again.</p>
<p>Commitment is also reconnaissance. More actions, more information. Ignorance is choosing not to see the information. Stubbornness is seeing it, and maintaining the status quo for thrill of ego. Humility is hunger for more information.</p>
<p>Uncertainty invites fear and worry. Perceived time spent amplifies fear and worry. Uncertainty in the path. Uncertainty in the destination, etc.</p>
<p>A plan is the process of committing to something knowing that hindsight bias creeps in with each step. The plan mitigates the drag of hindsight bias.</p>
<p>Fear and anxiety are compounded when accomplishment doesn’t happen within perceived time. Human nature is to lose all track of time when in a task, so time should be planned for. Time to evaluate the plan and assess new information should also be decided in the plan.</p>
<p>Commitment to the plan is a recognition of the infallibility of human emotion. Judgment is evaluating if the plan could be improved, and the plan includes time/effort-base checkpoints for evaluation. Commitment is the recognition that, while the direction you’re heading may not be the right one, (shortest path between you and the edge of the forest which you can’t know at onset), walkikg straight is better than circling from changing direction multiple times. Straight lines are incapable of not exiting. Circles may exit but are capable of not exiting.</p>
<p>If new information overrides understood information at the time of the plan, and changes the decision that would have been made given the circumstances at the time of the plan, then wisdom and humility is the ability to change direction despite how many miles walked (sunk cost).</p>
<p>Walking in a straight line in business is “walking in accordance to the plan”. The time spent deliberating the plan should be proportional to the costs and benefits of the action, which requires judgment. Inspiration is praying that God will guide you and enable your plan.</p>
<p>Arrogance is believing you have infinite energy and time. Optimism is appreciating that any mile walked strengthens your legs, that the direction you chose may not match the imagined ideal. Self awareness is appreciating that the human mind is capable of any imagination, and few imaginations consider accurately all costs or benefits of reality. Imaginations are powerful, but can cause circling, and are most powerful during the plan. After the plan, use imagination to accomplish it. Before the plan, use imagination to design it. But don’t use imagination during the plan to redesign it, I.e, avoid circling.</p>
<p>Action gets stuff done.</p>

  <title>New business Checklist</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/new-business-checklist.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Getting paid is easy. Getting paid the right way is harder.</p>
<p>You don’t need to have an LLC.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get an address. You can use your own, but safer to pay $10/mo for a postal box. I use Ipostal.com</li>
<li>File an LLC. Use Incfile. Get it done right if you’re doing this business with a partner.</li>
<li>Using the EIN, go register a small business bank account. I chose Chase only because they do</li>
<li>Create a website.</li>
<li>Accounting software (Freshbooks)</li>
<li>On Freshbooks you can connect to strip. You need a website first.</li>
<li>Get an email provider. (Outlook or Google) You don’t need a website to do email, but you do need a domain. You can have anyone host your website, anyone register your name, and anyone do your email. But the company that registers your url will be the place where you manage your DNS records to set up your email.</li>
<li>Track your expenses separately. They’re all a tax write off.
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a separate credit card, perhaps a small business credit card, for just this purpose.</li>
</ol></li>
<li></li>
</ol>

  <title>My Advice for New Career People</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/my-advice-for-new-career-people.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The keys for me for job satisfaction are now pretty basic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is my manager supportive and someone I like spending time with?</li>
<li>Is the work continuously interesting? Will I develop skills that are likely to bring interesting opportunities in the future?</li>
<li>Is there incentive alignment between what I offer and what the company needs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog post will attempt to describe my thoughts on what makes for a fulfilling career. It’s a hard question. Maybe something in here is valuable as you search for your “ideal” career.</p>
<section id="likely-useless-career-advice" class="level1">
<h1>Likely useless career advice</h1>
<p>Now for a stream of consciousness about corporate employment…</p>
<p>Some say a job should help you 1) earn or 2) learn and if neither then leave. But that framework doesn’t really work because you can learn anything anywhere.</p>
<p>Knowledge is accretive. As I look back on jobs I didn’t love, I still learned things. I wasn’t a fan of the type of consulting I was doing 10 years ago, but I’ve now started a consulting firm and having had that experience is helpful. So it’s all kind of gray. I didn’t like pulling weeds as a kid but I’m now pulling weeds as a homeowner so yea, I’m glad I know how to do that.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-life-anyway" class="level1">
<h1>what is life anyway?</h1>
<p>Per <a href="../book-review/guide-to-decision-making.html">Guide to Decision Making</a>, “resulting” may apply if you say you made a good decision because you enjoyed a job. By the same token you made a bad decision because you didn’t enjoy the job.</p>
<p>The reality is that “all or nothing thinking” is more of a cognitive bias, per <a href="../book-review/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.html">The Coddling of the American Mind</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-worry-cure.html">The Worry Cure</a>. And so, you’re going to learn things as long as you’re remotely interested in learning things. Whether they satisfy your <a href="../book-review/the-6-types-of-working-genius.html">Working Genius</a> is another matter.</p>
</section>
<section id="i-want-my-dream-job-though" class="level1">
<h1>I want my “dream” job though</h1>
<p>Can you land your dream job? Or is it a myth? 30-40% of first time marriages end in divorce. And not all of the remaining 70-60% are blissfully happy either. But many of those 70% ARE blissfully happy. Or they will be. Or they were and they will be again maybe or something…</p>
<p>Marriage and work are similar: they’re a type of relationship.</p>
<p>Happiness in a relationship takes both people being committed to the happiness of the other. One sided relationships eventually crumble. But if both people remain committed to the other’s happiness, and other certain caveats…, the marriage will prove valuable to both for their whole lives.</p>
</section>
<section id="professional-and-life-happiness" class="level1">
<h1>Professional and Life happiness</h1>
<p>Happiness to me comes in two forms: doing the best I can with the circumstances I have (the cards I’ve been dealt) and choosing environments that are healthy (the game that gives me the cards).</p>
<p>It’s about 1) what you’re doing and 2) the environment and context you’re doing it in.</p>
<p>This is life. Some games are fun to me. Others less fun by definition. But any game may be better than no game. Unless the game involves a high risk of me breaking my spine. Nuance.</p>
<p>Point is: it takes a long while to find what environments you thrive in. Any company can offer just one or potentially many environments depending on their size or the role.</p>
<p>So if you don’t know what you’re interested in, you must explore. You try.</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-the-best-environment" class="level1">
<h1>Finding the best environment</h1>
<p>First on the environment.</p>
<p>Jane Austen is better at this than me. Take all those sisters in Pride and Prejudice who have varying views on love and stability. Some sisters believe in true love. Others think it’s a myth and instead choose financial stability. Of course true love wins in the end.</p>
<p>I suppose work is very similar: you’re going to get out of it what you believe is possible. After all: you work with and for people.</p>
<p>It will take time and risks to figure out what environments you thrive in, kind of like dating. The interview is part of the process. Bring in a company is another part. Talking to friends in other companies is a third part. Thinking grass is greener is a fourth part, and so forth. That’s life.</p>
<p><em>Your needs</em> also change in your career. As you change, your preferences change. It’s up to you to learn how to match your preferences with your environments, and how to accommodate your preferences within your environments.</p>
<p>If you don’t like your roommate, you can leave early or wait till your contract expires or etc etc. or you can try to work it out and get to know your roommate. All are options. Which you choose is up to you. In the end, a good environment takes two. But it also takes one to instigate change for the better for both. Reciprocity.</p>
</section>
<section id="experiment-your-way-to-a-happy-career" class="level1">
<h1>Experiment Your Way to a Happy Career</h1>
<p>Then there’s the <em>thing you’re doing.</em></p>
<p>You can “try” anything by doing it yourself. Do you want to be a teacher? Go try to volunteer teaching. Do you want to be a coder? Spend 20 hours trying to build an app. Do you want to be a doctor? Volunteer with doctors.</p>
<p>Four ways of learning what you like emerge. The quality of the information is ordered top to bottom while the amount of time it takes to get that information is bottom to top:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading about an industry or job is kind of helpful.</li>
<li>Talking to people in the field is more helpful.</li>
<li>Following and shadowing those people is even more useful.</li>
<li>But actually doing the work is the only way to really know.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read about 50 jobs to see what piques your interest and help you learn what’s out there. Next, you can increase the chance of pursuing a job you like by trying to do it without actually having to get the job.</p>
<p>You can get a pretty good sense by doing little projects similar to what the real work is going to be.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-not-try-something-because-of-a-dumb-reason" class="level1">
<h1>Don’t Not Try Something Because of a Dumb Reason</h1>
<p>A lot of people think they shouldn’t do something because they’re not good enough. Even professionals. (Tiger Woods just had his worst round of his life, but I’m guessing he’s still better than you.)</p>
<p>Or they think they shouldn’t try something because they’re not yet credentialed. “Don’t try this at home kids”. It’s what we’re taught.</p>
<p>And that’s kind of the great myth: the myth of titles and credentials. That you need to be experienced at something to be able to do that thing. But that’s a lie. Instead, you should only pursue the credential if it offers you something you can’t otherwise get (due to red tape). And until you get the credential, you’re just spending a few hours every day learning stuff and maybe passing an exam at the end. So if you ignore the exam, what’s stopping you from just picking up the activities today you may find rewarding?</p>
<p>I once spent a single week shadowing dentists in an open room in Honduras. I was a Spanish translator for these American dentists that came through. I felt pretty confident by the end that I could probably do one of the fillings just because it really wasn’t that complicated. And the dentists told me so. Once you look at 100 cavities in a mouth it’s not hard to spot them. This was the easiest way to de-myth this job: watching and observing.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It was actually really boring. Once you’ve seen 100 cavities you’ve seen them all I think. Glad I figured that out quickly! But I know there’s someone out there that disagrees with me and I’m glad they’ll be drilling my teeth and not me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>90% of most people’s jobs could be taught via apprenticeship, like the good old days. Today’s world of credentials makes people think they’re incapable of doing a pretty simple task: putting a tool into someone’s tooth. But before you invest 8 years of your life in dental school, why not go be a dental hygienist for 1 year? Instead of doing a coding bootcamp, why not just code in your basement for a month after hours? This is the way to find what you like.</p>
<p>Whether you enjoy doing that thing that created value for people can only be discovered by doing it.</p>
</section>
<section id="people-hire-you-because-you-offer-a-service-or-value.-period." class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>People Hire you Because you offer a Service or Value. Period.</h1>
<p>Your real job is to create value for people. It’s not a title. It’s not a credential. It’s not mandated or necessary in society. And if you were born 100 years before today or 100 years after the job may not exist. So think about opportunities in this way.</p>
<p>A healthier way to thinking about corporate life is: what creates value? Is there a reasonable exchange of goods for my offering?</p>
<p>I’m capable of many offerings. But they’re hiring for one offering. That’s life.</p>
<p>If I were selling apricots, and someone was offering me peanuts, would I exchange my apricots for their peanuts? Well, if we were the only two people sure.</p>
<p>But maybe I feel like I can get some avocados for my apricots. So can I find an avocado dealer? Do they even like apricots? Do they already have enough apricots? And if yes to all the above, are they even in the mood to exchange for apricots today? Lastly, do they like me?</p>

<p>Getting a job is more of a negotiation than anything. And everything in work is a negotiation. Read <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> and that becomes quite apparent. Work is nothing fancy. It’s not a title. It’s not a degree. It’s just doing little activities.</p>
<p>And after you’ve 1000 similar activities you’re soon labeled a data scientist or a farmer. And if you circled the right boxes on an exam and got a piece of paper you’re now a doctor/dentist. But the paper or the title don’t make you good at that thing. My point: create value, not titles.</p>

<h1>In Sum</h1>
<p>So yes. I’ve gone on a rant here. But hey this is my blog. I’m trying to talk about the deeper issues at how to choose a profession or a company within that profession. I’m trying to break away from the titles and credentials that blind our thinking away from the more important questions of “what activities bring me joy” and “how will I know it?” And “will someone pay me for doing this activity?” And “how do I find an environment of people that will enable me to do valuable activities and make it a pleasant place to work?” (PS, some say to not work for <a href="../book-review/elon-musk.html">Elon Musk</a>…unless you enjoy his working style.)</p>
<p>Long story short: make sure the company hiring you actually needs your skills to run their business. Strive to find better opportunities by putting yourself out there and trying new things. And find people you like working with. All the rest is just a bonus.</p>
<p>The most dangerous thing is to get all those good things on your first job because then you try to self actualize per Maslov’s hierarchy of needs. “Don’t it always seem to go That you don’t know what you got ’til it’s gone?” (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big+yellow+taxi+lyrics&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-ca&amp;client=safari&amp;si=AKbGX_rdaVK-rhf5KHnOAD2drrRmADv7R3TkES869sRtvhJtAOFIxRuJ9oGiG6TvSdbxEwjlbUdo-jivJcsfmZzA84yEzB3d-vLGFPTy5juD3yV4riCQxI1XJ6ZQGPnEjGqh-qYE7AaZxecxMD6ZV9wfd6ykO8ZaKA%3D%3D&amp;ictx=1&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi176q45LuFAxVsKkQIHdMLBT4QjukCegQIIxAE">Lyrics</a>) So if you get a “bad” job just know it’s part of the process and one day 10 years from now you’ll probably be grateful you had that job anyway.</p>
<p>If I didn’t actually answer your questions that’s because some questions are a perennial debate. Some popular people hate the idea of work-life balance, some embrace it. Go figure. And keep searching to find someone who sees work and career the same way you do, because there are millions of jobs in the work. Hundreds of millions.</p>

<section id="books-to-read" class="level1">
<h1>Books to read</h1>
<p>It helps to get perspective when choosing where you want to work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a> - have a decision framework</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/the-6-types-of-working-genius.html">The 6 Types of Working Genius</a> - understand who you are.</li>

</section>
<section id="practical-questions" class="level1">
<h1>Practical Questions</h1>
<p>Things I’d think about in your shoes:</p>
<ul>
<li>what loosely sounds interesting? Who perhaps knows someone with that type of role? How do I get 15 min with that person, or a quick email? (Use 6 degrees of separation to your advantage)</li>
<li>do I have an ideal salary? What’s realistic? (Levels.fyi, don’t over or undersell yourself. Figure out market rates and if your job will support your desired lifestyle in a location)</li>
<li>what’s the entry level job that gets me some experience 50% in the right direction that I’m interested in?</li>
<li>where will I learn?</li>
<li>Does this company offer flexibility to try new things?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes job searching is helped by thinking by contrast:</p>
<ul>
<li>what can someone not pay me $500k per year to do? $300k? $100k? (Nobody could pay me $500k to be an investment banker and work 100 hour weeks. Maybe they could pay me $2M and I’d do it for 2 years ya know? But $500 isn’t enough.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you’re interviewing:</p>
<ul>
<li>what incentivizes people on a daily basis?</li>
<li>will this job be around in 2 years? Why? Why not? Why might they fire me in 6 months for things 100% outside of my control? (Recessions, business strategy shifts, etc)</li>
<li>how essential is my skillset to what they do?</li>
<li>what relationship do people have with my would-be manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to potentially ask your hiring manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you see me fitting into this role?</li>
<li>Why might this role not be a good fit for me?</li>
<li>Who’s the highest ranking person who’s quit or been fired recently and why?</li>
<li>How do you define success for this role?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to ask your peers you’re interviewing with:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe your relationship with your manager?</li>
<li>describe the communication patterns of the team?</li>
<li>describe how decisions are made? What’s a recent decision that was made? describe your role in how the team made that decision?</li>
</ul>

  <title>How to Sign in with iCloud Calendar on Outlook for iOS</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>How do I add an iCloud account to iOS Outlook without it being a public calendar?</p>
<p>It was easy to add any gmail accounts but I didn’t know how to add my iCloud calendar to iOS Outlook. Part of the issue is my iCloud account is actually my gmail email address so I can’t sign in with this or it’ll load my gmail calendar.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to iOS settings &gt; iCloud &gt; get your <code>@icloud.com</code> name. If you use your gmail account for iCloud there’s still this <code>@icloud</code> account.</li>
<li>Attempt to log into iOS Outlook calendar. Apple will then make you create an app-specific password for iOS Outlook</li>
<li>Use this password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Done. Pain solved.</p>

<p><a href="../book-review/beyond-band-of-brothers.html">Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters</a></p>
<p>Leadership from the bayonette. 10 points of leadership by dick winters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strive to be a leader of character, competence, and courage.</li>
<li>Lead from the front. Say, “Follow me!” and then lead the way.</li>
<li>Stay in top physical shape—physical stamina is the root of mental toughness.</li>
<li>Develop your team. If you know your people, are fair in setting realistic goals and expectations, and lead by example, you will develop teamwork.</li>
<li>Delegate responsibility to your subordinates and let them do their jobs. You can’t do a good job if you don’t have a chance to use your imagination or your creativity.</li>
<li>Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don’t wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind.</li>
<li>Remain humble. Don’t worry about who receives the credit. Never let power or authority go to your head.</li>
<li>Take a moment of self-reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself if you did your best.</li>
<li>True satisfaction comes from getting the job done. The key to a successful leader is to earn respect—not because of rank or position, but because you are a leader of character.</li>
<li>Hang tough!—Never, ever give up.</li>

  <title>A Costly Mistake</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“This is the moment I’ve been waiting for”…until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Several years ago as a budding data scientist I got excited by using a massive compute cluster. This is it. This is when I get to do Big Data Science, baby!</p>
<p>A few thousand dollars later, I realized my hundred-dollar-an-hour cluster wasn’t doing the thing I hired it to do.</p>
<p>My patient manager David Mantilla ssh’d into my cluster and discovered that out of the 64 cores I paid for, I was using only 1.</p>
<p>A good manager goes a long way. He just laughed as I stared in horror at my gross misconduct.</p>
<p>Be kind to the noobs. Because you still are one in many ways…</p>

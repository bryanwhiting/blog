<p>When we don’t have time to build an audience, we’ll partner with a creator. Give them a cut of the business.</p>

  <title>How I Learn and How to Hack the Audio Book and Speed Reading Game</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/how-i-learn.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been overdosing slightly on learning lately.</p>
<p>Ever since I got off social media, I got into writing (<a href="../tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.html">A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media</a>), and listening to audio books.</p>
<p>Podcasts are fine, but they’re about as quality as top-of-mind thinking. Books are usually far more instructive because each sentence is reviewed at least a few times if not a hundred times during the editing process.</p>
<p>I noticed that once I started binging books instead of posts, my happiness and satisfaction increased.</p>
<p>Here’s a strategy I’m using for learning.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get Audible and Spotify subscriptions. It has books that aren’t available on Libby (which I also use).</li>
<li>Stock up on free books using Libby. Hold times vary, but can be a few weeks or months for popular titles. Note: you can supply multiple library accounts.</li>
<li>For short books not on Libby, check Audible free catalog. If it’s not in the Audible free catalog, check Spotify Premium listening, which is 15 hours per month. If you listen to short books on Spotify, you can get 2-3 books in 15 hours. (It’s 15 book hours, not listening hours.) Also, if your phone is locked, you can go beyond the 15 hours (don’t report this…). But once you re open the app the 15 hour limit will halt you. 2-3 books would otherwise be $20-45 dollars depending on the cost of the audio book. $12 for Spotify premium is a deal.</li>
<li>Use Audible credits for books you can’t find on Libby or Spotify. Remember, Audible is $15 per month. So don’t waste it on a $4 book. Buy the expensive books or &gt;15 hour books with the credits.</li>
<li>With all the cash savings, and if you still have time, now you can buy the remaining books you want on either Audible and Spotify.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most books are on Libby. Domain specific books and cutting edge releases books are on Audible. Lots of great in between books on Spotify Premium.</p>
<p>I don’t know why but after 50 books you get a sense for what books are going to be available where.</p>
<p>Lastly, on Chrome I use the SwiftRead extension for speed reading and on iOS the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/outread-speed-reading/id778846279">Outread</a> app.</p>

<p>Working for a startup is like being a nanny. You can love it all you want, but it’s not yours.</p>
<p>In the words of Michael Jackson:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Billie Jean is not my lover She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always remember: unless you own it, the kid is not your son.</p>

  <title>5 Questions You Should Ask Before Adopting AI</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/5-questions-you-should-ask-before-adopting-ai.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I see a lot of executives dive into AI with a fury of excitement - the possibilities are endless. As it results, chatbots offering used cars for $1, refund policies you don’t want to stand behind and having the system generate fake legal briefs (<a href="../tech/three-ai-failures-needing-guardrails.html">Air Canada’s failed AI-generated Refund Policy and other AI mishaps: When you need guardrails on your AI</a>).</p>
<p>I see this with experienced executives saying “I want to just infuse my product with AI.” For example, “I’ve got 100 PDFs and a wealth of knowledge that I want to integrate into my app”.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re an unknown artist. What’s more likely for success: pain something you want, or paint something by commission?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-ai-apple-picker.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">How much time will it take to build an AI apple picker vs just hiring someone?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Software fails when software developers build something because it sounds like a good idea. Essentially, they build a solution looking for a problem. Or they believe “if I build this my customers will love it.”</p>
<p>The same goes for AI. We’re at a new wave where anything is possible. Perhaps you’re so entrenched in a problem you intuitively know the solution, build something, and your customers (or coworkers) love what you’ve made.</p>
<p>Far more likely is you end up believing AI isn’t working.</p>
<p>Here are the five questions you should ask before adopting AI:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whats the job my customer will hire my AI to do? (<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Know Your Customers’ “Jobs to Be Done”</a>)</li>
<li>Why will they hire my AI?</li>
<li>How much is not having my AI costing them?</li>
<li>If my AI didn’t exists, whats the stupidest way my customers could get an 80% solution?</li>
<li>If my AI does exist in all its glory, why will it fail miserably to do the job its hired to do?</li>
</ol>
<p>Too many dive straight to a solution.</p>
<p>Yes, AI is and will revolutionize jobs. The first ones it’ll revolutionize are the obvious ones: the boring or time intensive tasks that you’re already doing. For Hollywood, AI will replace the laborious task of generating storyboards and such (<a href="../tech/unreal-ai-sora.html">Unreal AI: Meet Sora</a>). They’re not trying to solve world hunger (first) at open AI. They’re trying to replace jons that are already being hired for. They want to replace truck drivers with AI drivers, warriors with AI drones, and creatives (artistic, musical, and software) with AI. They invented a whole new way of doing…the thing that needed to be done anyway.</p>
<p>Don’t solve a problem that nobody cares about. Because at this point in the economy your customer already has Google, competitors they can go to, and half baked solutions they can already muster on their own. What they need from you is a solution to their biggest problem, now.</p>
<p>Maybe AI will solve that. Maybe some basic software will instead. Ask yourself these three questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Will this save time?</li>
<li>Save energy?</li>
<li>Save money?</li>
</ol>
<p>If not, it’s not worth your time, energy, or money to develop.</p>

<p>And don’t forget the lawywrs being sanctioned for not reviewing their AI: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/new-york-lawyers-sanctioned-using-fake-chatgpt-cases-legal-brief-2023-06-22/">New York lawyers sanctioned for using fake ChatGPT cases in legal brief | Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>Be careful - AI is incredibly hard to control. Open tools exist to attempt impose guardrails, but they’re not perfect: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01822v1">Building Guardrails for Large Language Models</a>.</p>
<p>If we can’t contain today’s AI, can we contain tomorrow’s? This isn’t to be an alarmist, but a pragmatist. Machine learning was used in a lot of wrong ways before it was able to be harnessed for good. The same will likely be true for AI.</p>

<li>AI will empower the few creatives to not need underlings. Same in legal - no need for temps or paralegals. Tech can replace them, empowering the truly competent to get more done faster. This will eliminate jobs near the bottom, not near the top (the ones in control to begin with)</li>

  <title>Unreal AI: Meet Sora</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Years ago Deepmind proved they can solve StarCraft: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cUTMhmVh1qs?si=BXO9WJ-2WV1jgf0f">YouTube</a></p>

Now OpenAI is probably using reinforcement learning using physics engines. Meet Sora: <a href="https://openai.com/sora">Sora</a>.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
If you think OpenAI Sora is a creative toy like DALLE, … think again. Sora is a data-driven physics engine. It is a simulation of many worlds, real or fantastical. The simulator learns intricate rendering, "intuitive" physics, long-horizon reasoning, and semantic grounding, all… <a href="https://t.co/pRuiXhUqYR">pic.twitter.com/pRuiXhUqYR</a>

  <title>Observable Framework 1.0 vs Quarto</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/observable-framework-vs-quarto.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/">Observable Framework</a> seems like a nice competitor to Quarto. It seems like it has far fewer features, but some other more specialized features.</p>
<p>Things they can both do:</p>
<ul>
<li>use markdown to build websites and apps</li>
<li>Use Observable for plots and reactivity</li>
<li>Load data from any format, using any language</li>
</ul>
<p>Things Quarto excels at:</p>
<ul>
<li>more full featured - can be a blog, a site, etc.</li>
<li>can execute raw R or Python code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things Observable seems better at (based on glancing the docs only):</p>
<ul>
<li>More beautiful</li>
<li>More powerful reactivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like observable is good for people who prefer JavaScript for plotting.</p>

<p>Obviously war profits defense contractors. This isn’t anything new.</p>
<p>And putting aside beliefs about the war itself, I see the angle here as somewhat inauthentic. It assumes tech is somehow awful.</p>
<p>Arms dealers will always be in the race for selling more arms, whether in peace or in war. But providing services at a discounted rate to defend an invaded ally seems reasonable.</p>
<p>My point: I wish we had more positive tech news. Tech is how we won WWII and almost how we lost it. That same awful WWII tech is how we now power homes with cleaner energy across the world. Some argue it’s how we’ve avoided a WWIII so far because it’s a nuclear war is an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>Tech cannot control the hearts of the men and women who wield it. It can only enable them. May we all strive for wars of words and code not wars of people or weapons, and I actually think tech helps enable that. And hopefully, we can use tech to facilitate misunderstandings and bring people to better diplomacy, ending the need for war. But that’s up to the leaders. Desires for war rage within hearts long before those desires rage within bullets.</p>
<p>As for the main stream media, I’d hope for more nuanced discussions around the uses of tech. Perhaps that’s what it’s alluding to - that war mongers are being fueled by this war.</p>
<p>But then let’s get more diplomatic leaders into office that can manage peace talks. It’s a people problem. Our government shouldn’t be run by the war machine, but by the people. And tech will always enable the people to do what they do best: be human.</p>

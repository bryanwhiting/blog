  <title>Handling Outliers in Linear Regression</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/handling-outliers-in-linear-regression.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>So you have an outlier in your data. How do you handle it?</p>
<section id="three-ways-to-handle-an-outlier" class="level1">
<h1>Three Ways to Handle an Outlier</h1>
<p>Well, you can either include it or drop it from your data. If you include it, it may bias your regression coefficient.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you have some data where you have X = Emails Sent and Y = Sales. You want to know the effect of email on sales.</p>
<p>You have at least three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: fit the model on 100% if data, and don’t account for the outlier.</li>
<li>B: Create a dummy variable that’s 1 for outlier and 0 otherwise.</li>
<li>C: drop the outlier from your data and fit without a special feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that options B and C are identical in their predictions for non-outlier time periods. Effectively, you isolate the effect of those outliers when you create a dummy variable for them. Let’s take a look.</p>
</section>
<section id="scenario-1-outlier-with-constant-effect" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scenario 1: Outlier with constant effect</h1>
<p>Here we have some sales data over time. You can see the outliers here are all relatively equally high:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-outlier-sales-only.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Sales</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now I’m going to fit a model as above and get the “fitted values”, or in-sample predictions. We can see from this that the A model (no outlier treatment) has a higher line. This is the effect of the outlier on the slope. But the B model fits the data near perfectly. You’ll notice the C model and the B model are perfectly overlapping except for the gap on C (remember we dropped rows, so we didn’t have in-sample fitted values there!)</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-in-sample.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">In sample predictions</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now, the model B is Y = intercept + email + is_holiday Boolean. If you make a prediction assuming is_holiday = 0 then you get the green line. This is the effect of making a prediction of what your sales would have been if it wasn’t a holiday. This is one way to get a “baseline”. Then the blue line is the predicted value with holiday = 1. The gap between blue and green is the effect of your holiday (I could show the model coefficients but I’m lazy!)</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-fitted-and-non-fitted.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Fitted and non-fitted B values</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Okay, last interesting bit: what would the prediction of the model C be during this holiday period? Remember, we don’t have in-sample predictions (fitted values) because we dropped those rows. So technically, this middle spot is “out of sample” for model C.</p>
<p>What do we see? Well since the slope for “email” is the same for model C and B, the predictions are near identical. Let’s add in the model C non-fitted line:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-model-c-out-of-sample.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Predicting model C out of sample</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What do we see? We see that model C (purple line) overlaps the green line perfectly.</p>
<p>So per this simple example, there are two ways of handling an outlier:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop it from your data (not ideal)</li>
<li>Use feature engineering to handle it (ideal)</li>
</ol>
<p>In a more complicated setting, there are tons of real world interactions in your data that make this even more complicated. But with good feature engineering you can isolate the effect of those outliers or subgroups.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. As always, always test the principle on your own data before fully trusting this principle. There may be something specific about your data or your model where this may not apply exactly (such as using decision trees or a GLM or GAM).</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s a beautiful world. You can ask ChatGPT to code up these analyses really quickly. Do you have a debate at work? Ask ChatGPT to run a simulation.</p>
</section>
<section id="scenario-2-variable-impact-outlier" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scenario 2: Variable impact outlier</h1>
<p>In this scenario, we assume that the outliers are unpredictably spikey. Some days are more spikey than others. This might be representative of a holiday period where a few days are on the weekend.</p>
<p>We see again that our principle holds: the regression coefficient is largely the same.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-charts-sales-scenario-2.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">When you have non-stationary outliers</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="scenario-3-massively-spiky-outliers" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scenario 3: Massively Spiky outliers</h1>
<p>Now what if you have a holiday period AND a massive one-day spike (Black Friday)?</p>
<p>Here’s what the model predictions look like in green. <img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-3-massive-spike.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Massive spike"></p>
<p>And this is where we start to see the Model C predictions (drop outliers) differ from model B:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-massive-spike-3-compare-close-up.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Dropping has different results than retaining</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The predictions can differ by 10% or more. This means the coefficients can be wildly different, and that’s what we see. Model B’s email coefficient was 2.0 compared to just 1.1 for C. (Remember the model is <code>y ~ emails (+ holiday)</code>).</p>
<p>How do we solve this problem? Back to Scenario 1 - more feature engineering and interactions. # In Conclusion</p>
<p>Feature engineering has a huge impact on your model’s ability to make good predictions. Also, it affects the interpret ability of your model coefficients, which may be valuable in gaining insights from your data (such as what is the causal effect of email on revenue).</p>
<p>When you drop a row of data, you’re essentially creating a new model. And you’re implicitly targeting that row. You’re doing a type of feature engineering.</p>
<p>The better thing to do is to actually just do the feature engineering, because you’ll be able to generalize to similar data points like that in the future. # Other Ways to Handle Outliers</p>
<p>In this DoorDash blog, they provide a unique solution for XGBoost, mostly because XGBoost has a hard time extrapolating. But there are other ways to handle your data.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/">Galileo AI</a>. It lets you mock up UI interfaces. Great story in their blog: <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/blog/seed">Galileo AI - Feb 6 Launch Announcement</a></p>
<p>It doesn’t export the code itself, but for a fee it’ll export to Figma for you. The cool thing is they trained or fine tuned an LLM specifically on design components. This is a cool use case of how people with specialized skill sets will create custom LLMs to compete in areas ChatGPT won’t be able to.</p>
<p>This is also showing the emergence in new software: don’t build a rules engine, train an LLM to solve the problem.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Let’s assume you have a raw HTML file on GitHub, such as a <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-html/">Jupyter notebook you rendered to HTML</a> or a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html">Quarto</a> doc you rendered via <code>quarto render</code>.</p>
<p>If you try to share the link from GitHub directly, GitHub will just show the raw HTML file.</p>
<p>Use this link to convert it to your dashboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/">GitHub &amp; BitBucket HTML Preview</a></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>GitHub File: https://github.com/bryanwhiting/blog/blob/gh-pages/index.html</p>

  <title>Embedding audio in Quarto</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/embedding-audio-in-quarto.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I want to embed just a plain audio file in my blog post.</p>
<p>Check out the post <a href="../creative/guitar-clouds.html">Guitar: Clouds</a>, where I embed some audio using the quarto video short link: <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html">Quarto – Videos</a>.</p>
<p>My process:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a voice recording with my voice notes on iOS.</li>
<li>Save to files, I did audio/ folder (<a href="../posts/quarto-from-phone/index.html">How to blog from your phone using quarto (or hugo/jekyll/etc) using Working Copy and Obsidian</a>)</li>
<li>Then if I link using a standard markdown link it’ll create an audio recording in a new browser. If I use the video shortcode then quarto will embed it as a video right in the post (doesn’t open a new browser). You can adjust the height so it’s not a massive black screen.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
Song snippet today: [2024-02-05-guitar-clouds](../audio/2024-02-05-guitar-clouds.m4a) 3rd capo, G, Em, C, G with some pinky action. 


&lt;-- This works on safari, not chrome desktop for some reason --&gt; 

![2024-02-05-guitar-clouds](../audio/2024-02-05-guitar-clouds.m4a)


</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>
<p>Note, the second way (<code>the ![]</code>) approach didn’t work on Chrome Desktop, but works on Safari desktop, safari mobile, and chrome mobile:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Chrome doesn’t pick up the audio player</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If I inspect the HTML I can see the audio tag is created in Chrome, it’s just not showing a player or anything.</p>
<p>But the mobile audio player is picked up:</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Mobile chrome</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="obsidian" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Obsidian</h1>
<p>I like using this markdown syntax in Obsidian because that’s where I write my notes.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-audio-quarto-not-rendered.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The markdown syntax</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Because it appears like an audio player in app. The <code></code> syntax is a <code>quarto</code> thing and renders nicely. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag is supposed to work but doesn’t in my vault. In my app it looks like this;</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-audio-obsidian-rendered.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Rendered in quarto</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So yes, the markdown link is the most usable, works on most browsers, and works in Obsidian. Just doesn’t work on Chrome Web…(at least not on my version).</p>
<p>Seems also that using the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag breaks my quarto:</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Broken file</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="in-summary" class="level1">
<h1>In Summary</h1>
<p>I’ve found two ways of showing audio in quarto. 1) using the image syntax in markdown and 2) using a video shortcode. The markdown syntax works great locally on my iPhone and on most browsers, but the video shortcode seems to work on all browsers.</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos alluded to the “divinely discontent” customer in a 2017 shareholder letter (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/">Elements of Amazon’s Day 1 Culture | AWS Executive Insights</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly becomes today’s ‘ordinary’. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/Amazon_Shareholder_Letter.pdf">2017 Amazon_Shareholder_Letter.pdf</a></p>

</div>
<p>More googling shows the phrase was also used by Neal A Maxwell in 1976 (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng">Notwithstanding My Weakness</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What can we do to manage these vexing feelings of inadequacy? Here are but a few suggestions: (1) We can distinguish more clearly between <strong>divine discontent</strong> and the devil’s dissonance, between dissatisfaction with self and disdain for self. We need the first and must shun the second, remembering that when conscience calls to us from the next ridge, it is not solely to scold but also to beckon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Just dropping that in case Bezos gets all the credit for the term 😉.)</p>

<section id="llm-discontent" class="level1">
<h1>LLM Discontent</h1>
<p>People grappling with building LLMs are facing this discontent at an alarming rate. The <a href="../tech/llm-chatbot-arena-leaderboard.html">LLM Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a> is a testament to how quickly appetites will change. Many AI tool providers refrain from vendor lock in and try to build LLM agnostic tooling.</p>
<p>How do you compete? Well, most of us aren’t building these foundational models. How do they compete with each other? None of us care. We just want a good one.</p>
<p>But ask yourself, would you rather have Bard from today or nothing from 2022?</p>
<p>These leaderboards are fascinating because in 14 months since ChatGPT emerged we’ve become so reliant on these tools but yet they’re not even old enough to walk or talk by human standards. Yet we now have Bard, ChatGPT, LLaMA, Mistral, Claude, and whatever’s cooking at Amazon/Apple/Microsoft (behind the scenes as a contingency plan I’m sure) and the Chinese/Indian companies that don’t want to rely on the U.S.</p>
<p>It’s the early days of search: Yahoo, AOL, Ask Jeeves, etc. One will emerge as your favorite perhaps, like how we all use Google even though Bing probably isn’t that bad anymore (I wouldn’t know…).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Point is: it’s a race to the bottom, the customer is fickle. They know this, which is why they keep releasing new stuff every 6 months.</p>
<p>Point is: as you build your LLM application, your customer will be divinely discontent with <em>you</em>. This is nothing knew, it’s just the age of software development.</p>
<p>Expectations of what software can do are rising. Those expectations are becoming indiscernible from the magic that software is becoming.</p>

  <title>This drug is habit forming</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/this-drug-is-habit-forming.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Sometimes they tell you that at the pharmacy: “this drug is habit forming”. Or, the saline nasal spray bottle thing I tried once, “this spray is refreshing, but not habit forming.” Oh, how nice.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t everything have this distinction? Driving in the car: non habit forming. Eating a bag of goldfish when I’m noodling on a work problem: def habit forming.</p>
<p>One time, someone put a candy jar with skittles right beside my desk. It was for the whole floor, but my consumption was certainly not a pro-rata share. Buggy code? Gimme some skittles. Habit formed.</p>
<p>Social media? Someone likes your post? Habit formed.</p>

<p>Why don’t they warn that social media is one of the most addictive digital things we do? That we’ve just accepted as a society?</p>
<p>It took until 1964 before the surgeon general announced smoking caused cancer. The first cigarette machine was invented in 1881 by Albert Bonsack. That’s +80 years, not to mention it was popular for much longer before that.</p>
<p>So yes, society can get it wrong for many years before they change course and do the more healthful thing.</p>

  <title>The Matrix: Social Media’s Influence on Human Interaction</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/the-matrix.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?” - Dark Blue, Jack’s Mannequin</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I know kung fu - Neo, “The Matrix”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do these to quotes have in common? Social Media.</p>
<p>Everyone on social media is downloading something. They do it because they want to learn kung fu. And while they’re not on social media, other people are getting the download even more.</p>
<p>Something strange happens once you start spending 3+ hours on social a day. You start to see what’s actually going on. You start getting the cross-internet jokes. And once you do, you feel alone in a crowded room: you get the jokes that nobody else in your family gets. (Presumably because they have lives not on social media.)</p>
<p>Detach from social (<a href="../tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.html">A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media</a>) and you start to see something else: when you’re not on your phone at a party, you start to see <em>just</em> how much everyone is on social. Checking their SMS, their posts, etc. That’s when you really feel alone in a crowded room.</p>

  <title>A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tim Ferris describes <a href="https://youtu.be/_Fn-giKevmo?si=f1Lz9H2U08BQhKwv">why he doesn’t have</a> social media on his phone:</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fn-giKevmo?si=f1Lz9H2U08BQhKwv" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>I recently deleted social media from my phone 14 days ago. I had been using Instagram until April when I quit and migrated to Twitter the rest of the year. I recently realized within days how much better I felt without social media. Happier. Legitimately happier.</p>
<p>And why? What did I get out of it? I wasn’t growing closer to friends. That’s what texting and calling and spending time in person does. But I’d argue even texting doesn’t really strengthen a relationship because it’s so hard to properly interpret emotions and cues via text: you interpret them how you read those texts. You interpret it according to your emotional state, not the sender’s.</p>
<p>Phone provides vocal emotional cues. Body language another set of emotional cues. I can get probably 70% of this out from FaceTime or <a href="../gratitude/zoom.html">Zoom</a>. But being in person is what we’re meant for.</p>
<p>This is why we strengthen relationships locally, and fail to continue ones from high school or our previous job.</p>
<p>So what was I doing on social media? Watching clips of either strangers I don’t care about or college associates I friended (once lived locally with) that I no longer talk to.</p>
<p>So what’s the knife you’re bringing to the gun fight? When at YouTube I heard the CEO praise a team for increasing “seconds watched” by 15% by reducing the lag of the swipes between YouTube shorts (TikTok clone). The lag reduction was in the milliseconds. Meaning: they made the slot machine more addictive.</p>
<p>Your attention is being bought and manipulated by the shareholders of these companies.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>They A/B test everything. This isn’t morally wrong. It’s actually quite human: we all A/B test everything every day. A joke here. A smile there. We put out feelers and see if we get a reaction. Don’t believe me? Ask my kid why he keeps throwing things in the toilet!</p>
<p>Billions of dollars and the brightest minds on earth are working at FAANG. Why? They need to provide for their families and academics doesn’t pay. Non-profits don’t pay. This isn’t immoral, it just is. There are very good people working there: honest, moral people. Some of the best I’ve seen in the industry. But when you get paid to maximize swipes, you maximize swipes. It’s just human nature. And some of them buy into the odd notions of “snackable content”, as if swiping for 30 minutes while on the toilet is what anyone wakes up excited to do. Keep on snacking…</p>
<p>Social media and Netflix provide a ton of value to the world in my opinion. I can use them to call anyone I want, raise money for a cause, or get likes on a cute pic of my cat (I don’t have a cat). I <em>do</em> see the value.</p>
<p>But the costs for me have outweighed the value.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> miss laughing about some random Reel. There’s nothing that can get you laughing faster than a 10 second clip paired with the right cuts and music and everything. The right meme just nails it in a way nothing else can. I miss seeing memes from my friends. But when all I do is send memes to these friends, is that a friendship?</p>
<p>Since being off social media I feel like my senses have grown. I now find my kids a lot funnier, my wife funnier, and I’m able to make heavy situations lighter much easier.</p>
<p>There’s a quote in <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> that’s something like “If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken”. I’d argue my other relationships had weakened too. Time to leave the fight. I was losing.</p>

  <title>AI won’t replace us. We’ll always create.</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/ai-will-not-replace-human-creativity.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I recently got back into writing some poems. <a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a> was fun to write. After the fact, I tried getting ChatGPT to create something similar. I only tried once before declaring victory.</p>
<p>Why is this poem meaningful to me? Because it has my soul in it. It’s the summation of my experience as a parent. Should you find it interesting, perhaps that’s why.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.html">The Best of Edgar Allen Poe</a> recently I’m amazed (besides how depressing he is) at how excellent a writer he is. He peers into the mind and soul and extricates anything interesting. It’s interesting because a human wrote it.</p>
<p>Do we still paint, even if a camera can take a picture? Do we still ride bikes and horses even with cars and things? Do we still read even though we have TV and movies?</p>
<p>Words. Creative expression. They will always be interesting to us. Humans are interesting to us. Stories. Social acceptance is a fundamental human need. We desire connection. We’ll like reading something because a human wrote it.</p>
<p>But what about that guy I heard about who makes a ton of money using ChatGPT to create fake digital books on Amazon. People don’t <em>know</em> it’s AI-written. Digital GenAI images now are insanely accurate - it’s only 2024. It’s very possible great AI art will inspire us more than non-AI art (whatever that means because everyone uses photoshop anyway).</p>
<p>I’m not saying we won’t find value in AI art (creative writing, digital, video, etc.). We will. It’s clear we’ll have a really hard time knowing what’s human vs not.</p>
<p>But I am saying that creativity will never disappear. We’re always going to be interested in creating - even if machines can do it better. Machines can beat us at Go and StarCraft (<a href="../posts/2023-12-25-ai-robots-are-mastering-tasks-faster-than-humans-/index.html">AI Robots are mastering tasks faster than humans</a>), but we’ll still play. Because what else will there be to do?</p>

  <title>What startups and musicians have in common</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/what-startups-and-musicians-have-in-common.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was reminded of a video I watched a while back on YouTube. It was a great documentary about these new artists and their debate about whether to sign a record label (there’s a recent trend to selling music as an independent artist).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-musician-signing-record-label-watercolors.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Putting pen to ink</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I forget all the details, but there are some roughly insane trends that are generally interesting as I recall:</p>
<ul>
<li>new record labels are for $500k give or take. This is so the artist can invest a year into their music and get an album out, pay for production, etc.</li>
<li>many artists at that early stage aren’t financially literate and end up wasting the (they’re musicians, not bankers)</li>
<li>Some have to pay back the money</li>
<li>Up to 85% of the streaming royalties are owed to the label (started when streaming became a thing)</li>
<li>Labels also take a large portion of touring revenues now (something that wasn’t common 10 years ago)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this similar to tech startups? Lots.</p>
<p>Musicians have to find product market fit. They need to find their customers. Their monthly listeners.</p>
<p>They need to keep them coming back.</p>
<p>They need to differentiate.</p>
<p>Those who are customer focused and build a following are those who succeed. (Money in the bank and relying too much on the label can cripple you)</p>
<section id="the-musicians-in-town" class="level1">
<h1>The Musicians in Town</h1>
<p>I remember hanging out with some new artists while I was running my startup (we both used the same videographer). I couldn’t help but notice how similar the dynamics were. The founders. The first hires (replacements). The convos about who gets what. It’s all very fascinating.</p>
<p>Not much else to say.</p>

  <title>The future wave of AI hype</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/the-future-wave-of-ai-hype.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Reading about Airplane’s failure per OnlyCFO. A few notable quotes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Airplane’s shutdown and future shutdowns like this will have negative consequences for many early stage companies. For many years buyers of these tools haven’t had to deal with a tool being abruptly killed. It only takes this happening once for you to really second guess purchasing a startup tool that is mission critical, deeply integrated, or would take a long time to replace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>

<p>This chart is misleading for a few reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What’s the denominator?</li>
<li>What’s the denominator…</li>
<li>Denomi…</li>
</ol>
<p>As Carta grows, their user base grows, their churn rate grows.</p>
<p>I’m also concerned for Carta’s investors. If they’ve got this many churning users, I’d really like to know the denominator.</p>

  <title>The Dream State of Software</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/dreaming-software.html</link>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Dreaming code working is ever coders dream</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I returned from vacation yesterday and tried running my code. It didn’t work. I looked at code I had written, it had my imports correctly and all - why wasn’t it running?</p>
<p>The file it was importing didn’t exist.</p>
<p>I thought I created that. I swear I made it. My coworker remarked, “oh so you set up all the scafffolding but didn’t write the actual code?” I was in disbelief. maybe it was deleted by accident or stashed on another branch. But the <code>git log</code> shows all: the imported file never existed.</p>
<p>In <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>, Paul Atriedes has many visions and the author uses this feature to skip the book ahead three years. Paul wakes up one morning and doesn’t know what’s past or future. It’s all one in his mind.</p>
<p>So it is with software. It gets created in the mind near instantly. Coding is a burden, the journey of many failures and design choices to enable the simple vision of the mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps Gen AI can help us dream software faster. I look forward to when my dreams are realities, and not the rude awakening I still have coding to do.</p>

  <title>The Psychology of New Software Releases and its Parallels with Fashion</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/why-we-want-new-software.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>What is it about a new release that gets people excited? Would you buy software that never changes? How about a hammer?</p>
<p>Why are we okay with buying a hammer, but not stagnant software? Our culture is addicted to new widgets. A/B testing.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Shipping software like fashion, every season</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Software releases are free, but development is not. Therefore, research and development is constant, whereas the Hammer company hasn’t needed to update its product in a couple…millennia. That’s why they call it software. It’s not hard to make.</p>
<p>Is there a way to sell software like you sell a hammer?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;Because per <a href="../book-review/innovators-dilemma.html">Innovator’s Dilemma</a>, those who can out-do you will. And software is easy to alter and improve. I’m not convinced all “updates” done in the software industry are actually improvements, but people like change. Ever see a fashion line repeat itself?</p>
<p>Software is like fashion.</p>

  <title>Replacing human work with AI</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/swapping-out-human-labor-for-ai.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/4-questions-to-ask-swapping-out-human-labor-ai">recent MIT article</a>, the author discusses how to know if you’re ready for AI adoption. It boils things down to a rather obvious four-step questioning process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How much time would I save if I used AI?</li>
<li>How expensive is the task? (How expensive is the salary of the person doing the task.)</li>
<li>How capable is the AI of completing the task successfully?</li>
<li>How easy is it to determine if the output is good/correct?</li>
</ol>
<p>I say obvious because these are actually just questions you’d ask of any task worth doing by any person at your company. In every decision in running a business, there is an ROI question at play - what does this person cost me, what’s the return?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-ai-task-vs-human.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">It’s not: “should I use AI?” It’s “how?”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="knowing-what-you-dont-know-and-how-to-know-you-know-it" class="level1">
<h1>Knowing what you don’t know, and how to know you know it</h1>
<p>The author lays out the hypothetical “I asked this ChatGPT to write something in Perl and it did it well on the second try!”</p>
<p>Consider that. Do you know what Perl is? Would you know how to evaluate if the code is complete? How would you execute such code - do you know the programs to run?</p>
<p>AI cannot solve these environmental, contextual problems yet. It can’t think through all the nuance. And, if you have an expensive salary, there’s a reason: you have a lot of experience. Experience to know what Perl is. Experience to recognize the code’s flaws and poor design patterns. This makes you all the more valuable <em>with</em> AI.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a highly creative, curious person could just ask AI “what programming languages are good for this task?” Like Neo in <em>The Matrix</em> when he “downloads kung-foo” into his brain, we all can get up to speed a lot faster.<sup>1</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="how-do-i-adopt-ai-not-should" class="level1">
<h1><em>How</em> do I adopt AI? (Not “should”)</h1>
<p>To me, the question isn’t “do these four questions check the box”? Instead, I see AI as an always-on strategy with various ranges of usefulness:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do you care what the final product looks like?
<ul>
<li>Are you okay with an 80% solution?</li>
<li>Is this throwaway work?</li>
<li>Do you plan to maintain this code as part of a 10,000 line code base?</li>
<li>Do you just need ideas to get started?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the risks in firing my experts?
<ul>
<li>Who will catch the mistakes of the AI? What if it’s wrong?</li>
<li>In many aspects of your business the risk of being wrong might be a lot lower than you think.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What <em>can’t</em> it do well?
<ul>
<li>Assume AI is doing everything at your company - what would that look like?</li>
<li>Give AI the benefit of the doubt first, then work backward from what it can’t do.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>I think that AI holds great power to aid our jobs in a lot of ways. It <em>will</em> replace a lot of jobs, just as there are far fewer farmers today than a hundred years ago. Those farmers are far more effective than ever before - we get more yield for less. It will replace <em>part</em> of your job - the stuff you know how to do but would rather have someone else do it.</p>
<p>Coders <em>will</em> be highly automatable, especially those who think otherwise. Lawyers. Graphic designers. Marketers. This is a cycle as old as time: people and businesses who think they have a strong hold on the market (think: BlackBerry, <em>Innovators Dilemma</em>) are the ones who always get eclipsed. # Learn the new skillset</p>
<p>Have everyone at your company use it today. It’s the new programming language. It’s the new way of authoring. And yes, prompt engineering (how you ask it questions) widely impacts its usefulness. Therefore, we all need to learn how to prompt engineer.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is the new skillset: <strong>knowing what question to ask and how to pressure test its validity</strong>. In essence, the learning acceleration curve has skyrocketed, and one person can now actually be good at many things a lot faster. It’s the curious person who will win. It’s the visionary. The evaluator. The one who knows where they want to go, can discern if the steps they’re taking are taking them to their destination, and who have the ability to adapt and course correct when necessary.</p>
<p>For now, AI can hardly do things outside data it was trained on. In the future 10 years that may change. If so, we’ll all be on the edge of scientific discovery, pushing the bounds of creative work, and focusing on the nuance that will win/lose that legal case. AI will have a seat at the table.

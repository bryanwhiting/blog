<p>Working for a startup is like being a nanny. You can love it all you want, but it’s not yours.</p>
<p>In the words of Michael Jackson:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Billie Jean is not my lover She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always remember: unless you own it, the kid is not your son.</p>

  <title>5 Questions You Should Ask Before Adopting AI</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/5-questions-you-should-ask-before-adopting-ai.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I see a lot of executives dive into AI with a fury of excitement - the possibilities are endless. As it results, chatbots offering used cars for $1, refund policies you don’t want to stand behind and having the system generate fake legal briefs (<a href="../tech/three-ai-failures-needing-guardrails.html">Air Canada’s failed AI-generated Refund Policy and other AI mishaps: When you need guardrails on your AI</a>).</p>
<p>I see this with experienced executives saying “I want to just infuse my product with AI.” For example, “I’ve got 100 PDFs and a wealth of knowledge that I want to integrate into my app”.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re an unknown artist. What’s more likely for success: pain something you want, or paint something by commission?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-ai-apple-picker.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">How much time will it take to build an AI apple picker vs just hiring someone?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Software fails when software developers build something because it sounds like a good idea. Essentially, they build a solution looking for a problem. Or they believe “if I build this my customers will love it.”</p>
<p>The same goes for AI. We’re at a new wave where anything is possible. Perhaps you’re so entrenched in a problem you intuitively know the solution, build something, and your customers (or coworkers) love what you’ve made.</p>
<p>Far more likely is you end up believing AI isn’t working.</p>
<p>Here are the five questions you should ask before adopting AI:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whats the job my customer will hire my AI to do? (<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Know Your Customers’ “Jobs to Be Done”</a>)</li>
<li>Why will they hire my AI?</li>
<li>How much is not having my AI costing them?</li>
<li>If my AI didn’t exists, whats the stupidest way my customers could get an 80% solution?</li>
<li>If my AI does exist in all its glory, why will it fail miserably to do the job its hired to do?</li>
</ol>
<p>Too many dive straight to a solution.</p>
<p>Yes, AI is and will revolutionize jobs. The first ones it’ll revolutionize are the obvious ones: the boring or time intensive tasks that you’re already doing. For Hollywood, AI will replace the laborious task of generating storyboards and such (<a href="../tech/unreal-ai-sora.html">Unreal AI: Meet Sora</a>). They’re not trying to solve world hunger (first) at open AI. They’re trying to replace jons that are already being hired for. They want to replace truck drivers with AI drivers, warriors with AI drones, and creatives (artistic, musical, and software) with AI. They invented a whole new way of doing…the thing that needed to be done anyway.</p>
<p>Don’t solve a problem that nobody cares about. Because at this point in the economy your customer already has Google, competitors they can go to, and half baked solutions they can already muster on their own. What they need from you is a solution to their biggest problem, now.</p>
<p>Maybe AI will solve that. Maybe some basic software will instead. Ask yourself these three questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Will this save time?</li>
<li>Save energy?</li>
<li>Save money?</li>
</ol>
<p>If not, it’s not worth your time, energy, or money to develop.</p>

  <title>Air Canada’s failed AI-generated Refund Policy and other AI mishaps: When you need guardrails on your AI</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/three-ai-failures-needing-guardrails.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In recent news, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/">Air Canada must honor refund policy invented by airline’s chatbot | Ars Technica</a>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-guardrails-on-ai.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">We can’t even contain today’s AI. How will we contain tomorrow’s?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Previously, trollers were able to convince the chatbot to agree to selling them a car for $1. <a href="https://the-decoder.com/people-buy-brand-new-chevrolets-for-1-from-a-chatgpt-chatbot/">People buy brand-new Chevrolets for $1 from a ChatGPT chatbot</a>. It’s possible some of these things may have actually been legally binding if someone wanted to sue for it.</p>
<p>And don’t forget the lawywrs being sanctioned for not reviewing their AI: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/new-york-lawyers-sanctioned-using-fake-chatgpt-cases-legal-brief-2023-06-22/">New York lawyers sanctioned for using fake ChatGPT cases in legal brief | Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>Be careful - AI is incredibly hard to control. Open tools exist to attempt impose guardrails, but they’re not perfect: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01822v1">Building Guardrails for Large Language Models</a>.</p>
<p>If we can’t contain today’s AI, can we contain tomorrow’s? This isn’t to be an alarmist, but a pragmatist. Machine learning was used in a lot of wrong ways before it was able to be harnessed for good. The same will likely be true for AI.</p>

If you think OpenAI Sora is a creative toy like DALLE, … think again. Sora is a data-driven physics engine. It is a simulation of many worlds, real or fantastical.

  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/observable-framework-vs-quarto.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/">Observable Framework</a> seems like a nice competitor to Quarto. It seems like it has far fewer features, but some other more specialized features.</p>
<p>Things they can both do:</p>
<ul>
<li>use markdown to build websites and apps</li>
<li>Use Observable for plots and reactivity</li>
<li>Load data from any format, using any language</li>
</ul>
<p>Things Quarto excels at:</p>
<ul>
<li>more full featured - can be a blog, a site, etc.</li>
<li>can execute raw R or Python code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things Observable seems better at (based on glancing the docs only):</p>
<ul>
<li>More beautiful</li>
<li>More powerful reactivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like observable is good for people who prefer JavaScript for plotting.</p>

</div>
<p>Obviously war profits defense contractors. This isn’t anything new.</p>
<p>And putting aside beliefs about the war itself, I see the angle here as somewhat inauthentic. It assumes tech is somehow awful.</p>
<p>Arms dealers will always be in the race for selling more arms, whether in peace or in war. But providing services at a discounted rate to defend an invaded ally seems reasonable.</p>
<p>My point: I wish we had more positive tech news. Tech is how we won WWII and almost how we lost it. That same awful WWII tech is how we now power homes with cleaner energy across the world. Some argue it’s how we’ve avoided a WWIII so far because it’s a nuclear war is an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>Tech cannot control the hearts of the men and women who wield it. It can only enable them. May we all strive for wars of words and code not wars of people or weapons, and I actually think tech helps enable that. And hopefully, we can use tech to facilitate misunderstandings and bring people to better diplomacy, ending the need for war. But that’s up to the leaders. Desires for war rage within hearts long before those desires rage within bullets.</p>
<p>As for the main stream media, I’d hope for more nuanced discussions around the uses of tech. Perhaps that’s what it’s alluding to - that war mongers are being fueled by this war.</p>
<p>But then let’s get more diplomatic leaders into office that can manage peace talks. It’s a people problem. Our government shouldn’t be run by the war machine, but by the people. And tech will always enable the people to do what they do best: be human.</p>

  <title>Create AI images with Google’s Gemini model</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/create-ai-images-with-googles-gemini-model.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>First seen on: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_i-think-that-google-may-have-come-out-of-ugcPost-7162219043054170112-73pn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios">Ethan Mollick on LinkedIn: I think that Google may have come out of nowhere to have the best LLM… | 19 comments</a></p>
<p><a href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx#">ImageFX</a> Is the tool to generate images with Google’s Gemini. I’ve been a huge fan of using ChatGPT on iOS to get images for this blog. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually good or not. But it’s helped me associate a post with an idea (image), which I think is incredibly helpful for memory retention. So my theory has been: some content is better than no content. The other thought is: better learn now what these tools are and how to use them because you never know where you’re going to be able to take them. They’re like learning how to drive a car: if you can drive, you can go places.</p>
<p>So how does ImageFX compare?</p>
<section id="battle-prompt" class="level1 page-columns page-full">

<p>This is but one test, and clearly chatGPT wins.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, ChatGPT added a camera <em>and</em> had the identical photo inside the camera’s viewport. I’m really not sure how LLMs are that capable, that’s some diffusion inside diffusion.</p>
<p>But winner goes to Gemini here! That nails the image best.</p>
<p>Also, Gemini has an editor that pops up that lets you swap out backgrounds or objects. Pretty neat!</p>

<p>ChatGPT wins by TKO on this one. Gemini perhaps can’t generate images of kids? Not sure.</p>

<h1>Final Battle: Picturesque Landscape</h1>
<p>Nothing better than a sunset, right?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sunset over the San Francisco Bay. Taken from the East, the Golden Gate Bridge is in visible. The sunset is bursting through a gentle fog, angle is taken from higher in the air, perhaps 1000 feet as if from a low helicopter view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/Pasted image 20240210200221.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-sf-sunset.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">SF sunset</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And a real photo taken from Google Images:</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">What the sunset really looks like</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Winner here is Google Images search! Both of those photos are bad. ChatGPT nailed the fog, which Gemini omitted. Gemini is much closer to the mark but made up a city to the right. Both of them couldn’t produce the right angle for the sun. But hey, they’re both better than nothing!</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Gemini is here! I can now use it to create images from my phone.</p>
<p>As a consumer, I think the mobile experience of ChatGPT is really great. But if I’m on desktop I may use Gemini because it gives me four variations for each prompt. And it’s free. Can’t beat free.</p>
<p>But ChatGPT can do crazy things that Gemini can’t, such as the head to head battle.</p>

  <title>Protobufs - Everything I don’t know</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/protobufs-everything-i-dont-know.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>If you want a guide on Protobufs this isn’t it. These are my notes. Just stumbled on this tonight after having seen these all over the place at Google and I wanted to learn something.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffers Documentation</a> and ChatGPT. <a href="../tech/pkl-for-configuration-management.html">Pkl for Configuration Management</a> made me think of this. # The point of a Protobuf</p>
<ul>
<li>write one file</li>
<li>This file defines data structure, but not the data itself</li>
<li>Compile it to different languages (like Python)</li>
<li>A file in Python will be have a class defined with the properties in it</li>
<li>When you serialize data (send via JSON or something over an API) the other service knows how to read that data file immediately (if you built it and gave it the proto)
<ul>
<li>This makes sense to me why Google used this everywhere. They have one service in Python and another in Java and another in Go. To get them talking to each other they need a common data structure to read from.</li>
<li>The setters and getters help with the parsing a JSON blob for example.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Like first you define the protobuf</p>

</div>
<p>And then you compile it via a bash command and it turns to this:</p>

  <title>Pkl for Configuration Management</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/pkl-for-configuration-management.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://pkl-lang.org/blog/introducing-pkl.html">Pkl</a> is the new kid on the block.</p>
<p>Have you ever built a config for a modeling pipeline? Surely, if you’ve built a pipeline to do experiments you’ve wondered how you can quickly iterate through a bunch of different settings to see which model is the best for your use case.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to generate a list of hypothesis to test, and then compare and contrast them.</p>
<p>Like any good data scientist you’ve created a system to loop over some settings.</p>
<p>It’s the big challenge of data science: how do I configure something? Should I build this function to do one thing or should I build a development environment where I can explore a thousand things? If I build a development environment how do I know if all the things I’ve configured aren’t going to be moot in a few weeks or months?</p>
<p>I don’t have the answer to those questions. But perhaps how we design our configs can affect those design decisions.</p>
<p>Pkl is cool because it lets you do a for loop to output configs.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic config file per their docs:</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Config</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And here’s that config looped and rendered:</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Rendered</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="application-to-ds" class="level1">
<h1>Application to DS</h1>
<p>I’m not 100% sure that this is any easier for a Python developer than just using ChatGPT to loop some parameters and spit out a bunch of yaml files. Because YAML does have some validation to it. And YAML has been around a long time.</p>
<p>Anything’s better than Python’s ConfigParser…yuck.</p>
<p>Reminds me of <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffers Documentation</a> but honestly I don’t know much about this stuff. See <a href="../tech/protobufs-everything-i-dont-know.html">Protobufs - Everything I don’t know</a></p>
<p>But it’s nice to see people are thinking about configs…</p>

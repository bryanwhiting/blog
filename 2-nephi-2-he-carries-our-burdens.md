# Scriptures

The Savior is known to have offered himself as a sacrifice for our sins:

> Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.
> [2 Nephi 2.7](../scriptures/2-nephi-2.7)

But that's not all He sacrificed himself for:

> Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
> [Isaiah 53.4](../scriptures/isaiah-53.4)

Did He specify which griefs? Which sorrows?

I think sometimes we can limit in our minds which sorrows. But since He doesn't specify, it's probably all sorrows. Yes. Actually, not probably. It *is* all sorrows. 

The time in middle school you were teased and you cried. The time in college you failed that test and wondered what the future would hold. The time your loved one passed away. The time you got rejected in some interview/deal/relationship/etc. Those sorrows. 

If you haven't felt any of these sorrows, I question if you've even lived...

The Lord's rest ironically comes when we take His yoke upon us. Just like he wants us to [Receive the Holy Ghost](sacrament-symbols/receive-the-holy-ghost.md), he wants us to receive His yoke. He wants us to join Him:

> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
> [Matthew 11.28â€“30](../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30)

# Meaning

When praying, it may increase the power of a prayer by holding in mind the imagery of the Savior beckoning us to be by His side. To be yoked with him. 

When we do, perhaps we'll see how close He is to us. How much he knows us. But we have to come to Him to feel that. He comes to us to invite us, but it's only when we turn to Him that we truly feel He is with us.

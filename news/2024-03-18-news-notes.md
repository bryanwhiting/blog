- Greg on how to bootstrap a busines. 
- This is an IRS tax form of a recent business we started. 95% of the businesses we start look like this:  

We use audience to bootstrap customers.

When we don’t have time to build an audience, we’ll partner with a creator. Give them a cut of the business.

Then we’ll create a little community of the power customers. Sometimes it’s just an iMessage group or WhatsApp group.

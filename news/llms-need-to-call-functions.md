- LLms guess what functions to call, such as running a calculation in Python or a function to do a web search. 
- Efficient Tool Use with Chain-of-Abstraction Reasoning, Gao et al. (2024)

- Here’s code intended for task X: [previously generated code]    Check the code carefully for correctness, style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism for how to improve it.
- Next, we can prompt the LLM with context including (i) the previously generated code and the constructive feedback and (ii) ask it to use the feedback to rewrite the code

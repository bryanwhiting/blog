# AI

[Tesla finally releases FSD v12, its last hope for self-driving | Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/01/22/tesla-releases-fsd-v12-last-hope-self-driving/)
- 300k rules based system down to a model 
- you'll need both: a model and overrides. 
- Or, you train the model by learning from the scenarios encoded in your 300k rules engine (like DeepMind's AlphaGo)

[Fast Tracking RAG Model Evaluation with Synthetic Data](https://info.gretel.ai/rag-model-workshop)
- synthetic data to evaluate RAG responses?
- A response is non-deterministic, random
- Perhaps do a Levenshtein distance of sorts to evaluate of response is as good as you want?
- But isn't this the same as question-answer pairs and instruction tuning?

[Auto Wiki by Mutable.ai](https://wiki.mutable.ai/?utm_source=tldrai)
- this proves how powerful AI is. Just add data and watch it churn. 
- An example of an AI product. 

# Coding
[Python Does Not Fully Deliver OOP Encapsulation Functionalities](https://www.blog.dailydoseofds.com/p/python-does-not-fully-deliver-oop?publication_id=1119889&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=email-share&triggerShare=true&r=2ri91a)
- I learned how attributes are names in a Python class. As an R programmer, most of these things were never taught to me in school, and I've never *really* needed to know them (until working with software engineers)


# Product

[How Gong builds product - by Lenny Rachitsky](https://open.substack.com/pub/lenny/p/how-gong-builds-product?r=2ri91a&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email)
- the planning!!
> We do not plan monthly or biweekly. Both the engineering leader and I dislike the Scrum methodology. We feel it’s trying to drive urgency via artificial deadlines versus via value to the customer. And by forcing “commitment” to deliverables within a time window, it essentially inhibits on-the-fly trade-offs between content, quality, and timelines. Yet we have internal reviews with the different groups on a monthly basis.

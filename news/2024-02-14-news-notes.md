The crazy thing about AI is that it's moving so faat it's not longer "that'd be cool in 5 years if it did X". Instead it's "TikTok is doing X, Google's doing Y, researchers just did Z, OpenAI just did A-K...Apples still sleeping which means it's gonna do J-Z".

- Will this create echo chambers?
- Character.ai is doing this. Helpful for building personal assistants. 

# Gemini on Mobile



This doesn't work:

But at the top there's a Gemini button:

And here it's working!

Use [Create AI images with Google's Gemini model](../tech/create-ai-images-with-googles-gemini-model.md) instead.

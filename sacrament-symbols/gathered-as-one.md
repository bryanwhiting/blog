# Symbol

We take the sacrament as a congregation, as one unified body.

# Scriptures

When the sacrament was first administered, there was one bread and one cup. 

> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
> [Matthew 26.26–27](../scriptures/matthew-26.26-27)

Can you imagine being in that room with Him? Drinking the sacrament for the first time?

> There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; **One Lord, one faith, one baptism,** One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
> [Ephesians 4.1–7](../scriptures/ephesians-4.1-7)

This is what it means when we gather together. We are one. We all rely on the same One Savior. We've all made the same one baptismal covenant. We all worship the same One God. 

We all renew the same One covenant, which is a covenant to love and serve each other with His love. 

# Meaning

I gain strength looking around at people so incredibly different than me, but also so incredibly similar. The fact that all these people want to follow Christ too gives me strength.

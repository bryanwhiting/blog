Pouring water from the cup to my mouth. 

# Scriptures

Blessings for keeping the commandments (the commandment of tithing):

> Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not **open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.** And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.
> [Malachi 3.10–11](../scriptures/malachi-3.10-11)

The Lord invites us to drink his blood, to drink if we are thirsty:

> For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: **I will pour my spirit upon thy seed**, and my blessing upon thine offspring:
> [Isaiah 44.3](../scriptures/isaiah-44.3)

Blessings will be poured out on those who covenant with Christ:

> Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands **shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out**, and the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house. And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads of my people.
> [Doctrine and Covenants 110.9–10](../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-110.9-10)

The covenant of baptism is about pouring the spirit upon us:

> Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, **that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?**
> [Mosiah 18.10](../scriptures/mosiah-18.10)
> O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.
> [Mosiah 18.12](../scriptures/mosiah-18.12)
> Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a **testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body**; and **may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you**; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.
> [Mosiah 18.13](../scriptures/mosiah-18.13)

# Meaning

When I take the sacrament, I renew a covenant which binds me to a Lord who is eager and capable of pouring out blessings. He does not deliver in vain. He does not deliver spitefully. He does not deliver like a carrot on a stick. In short, he is not human. 

He delivers bountifully, readily, excitedly. When we rejoice, he rejoices ([Mosiah 18.9](../scriptures/mosiah-18.9)). It pleases Him to bless us:

> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, **that my joy might remain in you**, and that your joy might be full.
> [John 15.10–11](../scriptures/john-15.10-11)

His work is one of joy:

> And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.  And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
> [Luke 15.5–7](../scriptures/luke-15.5-7)

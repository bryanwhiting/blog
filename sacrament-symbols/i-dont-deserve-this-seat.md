# Symbol

Every week I have a great spot at church. One that I don't deserve. 

My mother in law saves us a bench. We're always late. But there's the near-front row bench. 

Whenever she's not here, the bench goes to someone who shows up before us and we're sit in the back where we deserve to be. 

# Scriptures

> For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
> [Ephesians 2.8â€“9](../scriptures/ephesians-2.8-9)


# Meaning

The Savior saves a place for all of us in heaven, one that we don't deserve. We cannot earn. But it's there. It's there because He showed up. He came. He did his part. 

Now it's up to us to take advantage of the work He's done.

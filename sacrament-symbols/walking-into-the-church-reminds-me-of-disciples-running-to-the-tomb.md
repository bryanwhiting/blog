# Symbol

My church has four class doors with a middle space between another set of glass doors. As I parked in the lot and walked to the door I couldn't help but think of Peter running to the tomb to see what has happened. 

As I enter the tomb, I don't see Christ, I see the remnants of his cloth and his sacrament body on the sacrament table. He isn't here. He is risen. 

# Scriptures

# Meaning

When I leave the church, I leave renewed, remembering I was here. I testified of His resurrection by taking the sacrament, and I left cleansed of the things that hold me down.

# Symbol

All are welcome. Everyone. He doesn't want a skimpy congregation. He wants it packed. The bread is offered to everyone, the way His life was.  

Likewise, his life was freely given. Free. He had control. And He gives the sacrament freely to all who see it. 

#  Scriptures

*All* are invited to participate in the sacrament, which is symbolic of the life He freely gave. All souls in the chapel are invited to partake of His goodness. 

Only He could give up His life:

> A natural effect of His immortal origin, as the earth-born Son of an immortal Sire, was that He was immune to death except as He surrendered thereto. **The life of Jesus the Christ could not be taken save as He willed and allowed. The power to lay down His life was inherent in Himself, as was the power to take up His slain body in an immortalized state.**
> [Chapter 25. Jesus Again in Jerusalem](../scriptures/chapter-25.-jesus-again-in-jerusalem)

Christ alone was given power by God to control the fate of his otherwise immortal body:

> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. **No man taketh it from me**, but I lay it down of myself. **I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.** This commandment have I received of my Father.
> [John 10.17â€“18](../scriptures/john-10.17-18)

By similar rite, all are welcome. He is in control. 

> And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not;
> [3 Nephi 18.22](../scriptures/3-nephi-18.22)

# Meaning

Because Christ had a choice, and not the Romans, over the timing of His death, and He chose to be taken in captivity, and He chose to walk up the hill, the Lord showed he did all that He could to offer Himself to us. 

When I pray, I'm not praying to an unknown God. I'm praying to one who fully understands me ([Porous Bread](porous-bread.md)). 

When I pray, I can remember He's already done His part. The only thing holding me back from feeling His love is me. 

How can I pray in such a way to lower those barriers that I put up between Him and me ?

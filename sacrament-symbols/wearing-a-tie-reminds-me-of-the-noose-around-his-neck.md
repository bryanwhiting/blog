# Symbol

I wear a tie to church on Sundays. Many consider it in jest as a noose. 
# Scriptures

> After this—His body then wrenched and drained of strength﻿—He confronted Judas and the other incarnate devils, some from the very Sanhedrin itself; and He was led away with a rope around His neck, as a common criminal, to be judged by the arch-criminals, who as Jews sat in Aaron’s seat and who as Romans wielded Caesar’s power.

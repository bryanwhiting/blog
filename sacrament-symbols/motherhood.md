# Symbol

Motherhood is implicit in the sacrament prayer. Where there is a Father and a Son, there is a Mother. 

# Scriptures

> O God, the Eternal **Father**, we ask thee in the name of thy **Son**, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.
> [Moroni 4.3](../scriptures/moroni-4.3)


# Meaning

We don't know why we don't pray to Heavenly Mother, or why she isn't mentioned in scriptures.

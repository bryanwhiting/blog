Every chapel I've been in has a vaulted, high ceiling. This is common across many church architectures. 

It reminds me of the stable where he was born. It reminds me of above, how he came down. It reminds me that there's space for everyone. Even if it's crowded on the ground, there's a ton of space Above. This is why he came: to make space for all of us. 

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
> [John 3.16](../scriptures/john-3.16)

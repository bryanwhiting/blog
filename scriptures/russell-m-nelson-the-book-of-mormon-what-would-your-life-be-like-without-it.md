> My dear brothers and sisters, I promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon every day, you will make better decisionsâ€”every day. I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life. I promise that as you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized against the evils of the day, even the gripping plague of pornography and other mind-numbing addictions.

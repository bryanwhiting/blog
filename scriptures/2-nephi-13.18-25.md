> In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon;  19 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers;  20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings;  21 The rings, and nose jewels;  22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins;  23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils.  24 And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty.  25 Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war.

> Instructions   Under the direction of the bishopric, one or more Melchizedek Priesthood holders may participate in a confirmation. They place their hands lightly on the person’s head. Then the one acting as voice:       Calls the person by his or her full name.       States that the ordinance is being performed by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.       Confirms the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.       States “receive the Holy Ghost” (not “receive the gift of the Holy Ghost”).       Gives words of blessing as guided by the Spirit.       Closes in the name of Jesus Christ.

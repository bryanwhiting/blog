> Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him—  4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;  5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.

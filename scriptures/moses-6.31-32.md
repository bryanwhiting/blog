> 31 And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord, saying: Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?  32 And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee.

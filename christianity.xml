  <title>Chewing the Bread Reminds me of His Slow, Agonizing Death</title>

<h1>Symbol</h1>
<p>When I take the bread, I eat. Eating takes something whole and makes it smaller. Each bite can remind me of a whip. Of a crown. Of a nail. Of a drop of blood.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-broken-bread.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Broken bread"> # Scriptures</p>
<p>Christ’s final moments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Betrayal. Judas chose to forsake his Savior for money. Jesus knew this would happen, but he also went into the garden to atone for the bitterest sin of all: knowing who the Savior is and turning altogether away from him. Christ must have felt true sorrow for a lost brother that day.</li>
<li>Loneliness. Where were his disciples while he suffered in the garden? They couldn’t stay awake.</li>
<li>Incredible emotional and spiritual pain - paying the debts of the world across time and space. Of all galaxies.</li>
<li>Disbelief of his followers. In his final moments with the Savior, Peter defied the will of the Lord, chose violence, and cut off the ear of a soldier.</li>
<li>Noose. He was walked like a lamb with a noose around his neck.</li>
<li>Crown of thorns.</li>
<li>Whips.</li>
<li>Mockery.</li>
<li>Heavy burden of carrying his cross.</li>
<li>The nails</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Each bite slowly decomposes the bread. Each attack on the Savior slowly decomposed his body, spirit, and mind to the point He felt forsaken by His Father. But he kept doing the will of the Father even as He felt forsaken. He showed the Way.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 13 - Enduring Beauty</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-13-enduring-beauty.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>While this scripture is sad, it tells some important truths:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon; 19 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers; 20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings; 21 The rings, and nose jewels; 22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins; 23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils. 24 And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty. 25 Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-13.18-25">2 Nephi 13.18–25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lists out all the things we think are so important, but really at the end of the day are meaningless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our dress</li>
<li>our decorations and fine things</li>
<li>Our hair</li>
<li>Our beauty # Meaning</li>
</ul>
<p>Beauty is a closeness with the Lord. Adhering to His gospel.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet! 16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace! 17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever! 18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people; <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-15.15-18">Mosiah 15.15–18</a></p>

  <title>2 Nephi 11 - Seeing My Redeemer</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-11-seeing-my-redeemer.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Nephi explains why he writes the words of Isaiah in his record:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for <strong>he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him</strong>. And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-11.2-3">2 Nephi 11.2–3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, he read the words and enjoyed reading them. Second, he identified with Isaiah - he felt a common bond with him, namely that they had both seen the Redeemer. Third, He wants to establish a testimony to his posterity by saying “Isaiah saw it, but Jacob and I did too. And there will be others as well.”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-jesus-at-the-temple-newborn.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Seeing the Savior"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Can I say I’ve seen my Redeemer?</p>
<p>Nephi wasn’t Moses. He wasn’t the son of Moses. He was the son of a dad who was called to preach to people. There were many prophets like Lehi, per 1 Nephi 1. But Lehi was chosen to leave. Nephi was diligent in His duties.</p>
<p>Seeing the Redeemer is a spiritual event. Moroni was visited by the Lord, “And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus.” (<a href="../scriptures/mormon-1.15">Mormon 1.15</a>)</p>
<p>If we recall, many were visited by Jesus and saw him with their physical eyes and didn’t recognize Him (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-16.15-17.html">Matthew 16.15-17</a>).</p>
<p>Then there was King Lamoni who also experienced a spiritual witness of the Lord: “For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have <strong>seen my Redeemer</strong>; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name.” (<a href="../scriptures/alma-19.13">Alma 19.13</a>) Was King Lamoni a prophet? No.&nbsp;A week before this spiritual experience he was sentencing his servants to death for not taking good enough care of his flocks.</p>
<p>I’m not sure there is a pre-requisite to “seeing” the Lord. I’m also not sure that seeing him with your literal eyes is important at all. But gaining a witness from the Holy Ghost that Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Chosen One on whom we rely on for forgiveness…this is what matters. If ye seek, ye shall find.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 6 - Waiting on the Lord</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-6-wait-on-the-lord.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Two scriptures stand out in 2 Nephi 6:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-6.7">2 Nephi 6.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people. For thus saith the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth with thee <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-6.17">2 Nephi 6.17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implication of “wait” means that not all things happen in the time table that we want to expect it to happen on. It’s important we don’t lose faith when what we perceive should be the timeline ends up not being the Lord’s timeline. # Meaning</p>
<p>Challenges come and go in life. What do we do when the Lord doesn’t turn back the challenge immediately? Do we “wait” to see His deliverance?</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 5 - Sometimes there’s war</title>

<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p><a href="../2-nephi-5-emergency-preparedness.html">2 Nephi 5 - Emergency Preparedness</a> talks about how Nephi was prepared to leave his family. He made swords.</p>
<p>Sadly, we learn that Laman and Lemuel and their people did content with Nephi and his people, even to “wars”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had passed away, and we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-5.34">2 Nephi 5.34</a></p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>War rages in the hearts of individuals. This verse brings sadness because there’s an aspect of not being able to change people (a good thing) and instead realizing that sometimes in life things might not change. So it’s time to move on.</p>

<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Blessings for keeping the commandments (the commandment of tithing):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not <strong>open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</strong> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. <a href="../scriptures/malachi-3.10-11">Malachi 3.10–11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord invites us to drink his blood, to drink if we are thirsty:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: <strong>I will pour my spirit upon thy seed</strong>, and my blessing upon thine offspring: <a href="../scriptures/isaiah-44.3">Isaiah 44.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blessings will be poured out on those who covenant with Christ:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands <strong>shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out</strong>, and the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house. And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads of my people. <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-110.9-10">Doctrine and Covenants 110.9–10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The covenant of baptism is about pouring the spirit upon us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, <strong>that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</strong> <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.10">Mosiah 18.10</a> O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.12">Mosiah 18.12</a> Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a <strong>testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body</strong>; and <strong>may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you</strong>; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.13">Mosiah 18.13</a></p>
</blockquote>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>When I take the sacrament, I renew a covenant which binds me to a Lord who is eager and capable of pouring out blessings. He does not deliver in vain. He does not deliver spitefully. He does not deliver like a carrot on a stick. In short, he is not human.</p>
<p>He delivers bountifully, readily, excitedly. When we rejoice, he rejoices (<a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.9">Mosiah 18.9</a>). It pleases Him to bless us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, <strong>that my joy might remain in you</strong>, and that your joy might be full. <a href="../scriptures/john-15.10-11">John 15.10–11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His work is one of joy:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. <a href="../scriptures/luke-15.5-7">Luke 15.5–7</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - Heaven and Hell in One</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-heaven-and-hell.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>This quote focuses on the dichotomy people feel as they draw closer to Christ. First, they have the desire. Second, they have positive experiences. Third, they doubt their worthiness. Or they wish that all the good things could prevent them from sinning again:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions? 27 And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy? <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.26-27">2 Nephi 4.26–27</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lord wants us to grow. Sometimes that involves choosing to see the good in an experience.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - Love and Despair</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-love-and-despair.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>2 Nephi 4 has two interesting scriptures:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine a human who has felt so much love to describe it as the consuming of his flesh, yet have perhaps a degree of self loathing because of his sins? That he’d like to be happy but he can’t because he knows what he’s done wrong?</p>
<p>I think anyone who is a human can empathize.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-peace-vs-despair.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Same person, same feelings"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Humanity is about building a relationship with God. God is about letting us have agency. He doesn’t expect us to be perfect. He expects us to be human, but guides us to perfection. In some sense He demands it, knowing we’ll fall short.</p>
<p>But we can take comfort in that He will bless us even when we feel undeserving.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - A Prophecy of Another Branch</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.2">2 Nephi 4.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another powerful reminder of things lost from the Bible, similar to <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-20-baptism-in-the-old-testament.html">1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament</a>. As we look at 2 Nephi 3:5, we see a link to the Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die, and go unto my fathers; and I go down to my grave with joy. The God of my father Jacob be with you, to deliver you out of affliction in the days of your bondage; for the Lord hath visited me, and I have obtained a promise of the Lord, <strong>that out of the fruit of my loins, the Lord God will raise up a righteous branch out of my loins</strong>; and unto thee, whom my father Jacob hath named Israel, a prophet; (not the Messiah who is called Shilo;) and this prophet shall deliver my people out of Egypt in the days of thy bondage. <a href="../scriptures/jst,-genesis-50.24">JST, Genesis 50.24</a></p>

<p>Imagine if for 2000 years the entire world knew about this prophecy and the other things in 50:24-38 # Meaning</p>

  <title>Coalesce - Revelation first, then Agency</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/coalesce-revelation-first-then-agency.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Some believe in pre-destiny. That their life is predetermined.</p>
<p>Some believe there is no God and they have to do the best they can with what they’ve got, because that’s all they’ve got.</p>
<p>The truth lies somewhere in between. There <em>is</em> a God, <em>and</em> He wants us to be agents (<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.28.html">Doctrine and Covenants 58.28</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-plan-a-and-b.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Life is filled with choices and many actions to perform"> In data science, there’s a concept called “coalesce”. In English it means to come together and make one whole. In software, it means to fill in missing data with a default value.</p>
<p>Forgive the nerd talk, but bear with me here: So if you have an empty spreadsheet, and you do the operation <code>coalesce(spreadsheet, 5)</code> it would return the spreadsheet’s value if you had data in the spreadsheet but the number 5 if you had a missing cell. So if you have 10 rows of data in Excel but 3 missing rows, the output would be the 7 original values with 3 cells now with 5 in them. It’s a way of handling missing data, because missing data creates problems.</p>
<p>What is the missing data in our personal lives? It’s “what do we do?” What do we do today? Tomorrow? Next year? What do we do today and tomorrow to prepare for the thing we may want to do next year?</p>
<p>I’ve realized the healthy way to have a relationship with personal revelation is to operate under the constraints of a coalesce. To be whole and one with the Lord, our goal should be to coalesce.</p>
<p>Some rely too much on the spirit. Hoping God will make a choice for us. But he gave us agency. He lost 1/3 of his children because he didn’t want to give up agency. And, by that right, he’s willing to lose you and me too if we’re not willing to exercise our agency. We just choose. This is life. And we must choose Him.</p>
<p>In many things, there is a commandment we can rely on. Don’t kill. Don’t steal. Be honest. Pay tithing.</p>
<p>That’s the priority.</p>
<p>Then there’s the gray area stuff: love our neighbor.</p>
<p>That’s the agency.</p>
<p>Then there’s the really gray area: have joy. Among this is “provide for a family” and “raise them the best way you can”.</p>
<p>So, use a coalesce. Your default value is what <em>you</em> want to do. That’s what you fill in.</p>
<p>Our life should be <code>coalesce(personal revelation, our agency)</code>.</p>
<p>Where there’s a commandment or personal revelation from the Lord, do it. Don’t wait. Do it. Follow the prompting. Otherwise, if you have no prompting or commandment to follow, make a choice! Learn. Experience. Enjoy.</p>
<p>I believe the Lord will support us when we follow a pattern of putting Him first, and then defaulting to doing many good things of our own free will and choice when He hasn’t given us instruction.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean he doesn’t care what we do. He cares deeply. It’s just more like <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23.html">Ether 2.23</a> where he wants us to come up with some good ideas.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 Ask</title>

<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Do you believe in what Nephi came to know?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.35">2 Nephi 4.35</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the limitations we can put on the Lord? Here are a few that get me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord wants me to struggle on this one</li>
<li>I don’t want to ask too much</li>
<li>This isn’t that big of a deal. I should pray about more important things instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these are easily contradicted by scriptures. He <em>does</em> want us to struggle but struggle <em>with</em> him and overcome (<a href="../scriptures/1-corinthians-10.13">1 Corinthians 10.13</a>). The Lord wants us to ask for all the blessings He’s capable of giving us (<a href="../scriptures/malachi-3.10">Malachi 3.10</a>), and pour out endless blessings.<sup>1</sup> And lastly, the Lord works by small and simple means (<a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps instead those three things should be exactly what we pray for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can we struggle on together? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30.html">Matthew 11.28–30</a>)</li>
<li>What’s the gift that thou art willing to bless me with? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-6.8.html">Matthew 6.8</a> )</li>
<li>What’s the smallest piece of help I could possibly ask for? (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23">Ether 2.23</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase “ask not amiss” isn’t some indication that a secret code needs to be enacted. That to unlock the heavens, the prayer needs to be offered in the right way at the right time by the right person.</p>
<p>How can you ask amiss? The scriptures teach us. If we’re selfish, seek our own, are puffed up, are easily provoked, want revenge, are greedy, etc. then we’re asking amiss.</p>
<p>But if we’re trying to do our best to be good people and dealing with the challenging responsibilities of being a father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, neighbor, coworker, manager, etc. then we’re just dealing with life.</p>
<p>What is life without these titles? Who doesn’t work? Who doesn’t have someone to care for?</p>
<p>It’s precisely <em>these</em> things that are worthy of our prayers and divine supplication.</p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a> is a theme I’ve tried this year. I’ve grown deeply in finding healing by making sure I can have a private place to pray.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen how prayers have been answered in ways I didn’t expect. That something comes unexpectedly and it turns out to be really good. But it wasn’t in the plans.</p>
<p>This is kind of like a personal manna. God delivers. Not expected. But welcomed.</p>

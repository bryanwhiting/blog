<h1>Symbol</h1>
<p>We take the sacrament as a congregation, as one unified body.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-one-congregation-feasting.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="We partake as one congregation"> # Scriptures</p>
<p>When the sacrament was first administered, there was one bread and one cup.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; <a href="../scriptures/matthew-26.26-27">Matthew 26.26–27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine being in that room with Him? Drinking the sacrament for the first time?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; <strong>One Lord, one faith, one baptism,</strong> One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. <a href="../scriptures/ephesians-4.1-7">Ephesians 4.1–7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what it means when we gather together. We are one. We all rely on the same One Savior. We’ve all made the same one baptismal covenant. We all worship the same One God.</p>
<p>We all renew the same One covenant, which is a covenant to love and serve each other with His love.</p>

<p>I gain strength looking around at people so incredibly different than me, but also so incredibly similar. The fact that all these people want to follow Christ too gives me strength.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Redemption</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-redemption.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Notice the words “in” and “through”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.6">2 Nephi 2.6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This provides some meaningful words. Rambling a bit here:</p>
<ul>
<li>in: because of?</li>
<li>through: by means of</li>
</ul>
<p>How are these two words different? One, Christ is a Being. He’s not an “amorphous entity”. By means of what He did for us, we can be redeemed. But it’s also because of who He is (presently as the Living Christ) in granting us forgiveness.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-risen-christ-by-the-tomb-redemption.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Risen Christ"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Christ’s atonement is infinite. It’s empowering to know that he’s already suffered for my sins of today and yesterday as well as tomorrow and beyond. Meaning, he already knows the mistakes I’m going to choose to make, which is kind of trippy in a way, but also comforting thinking about how He still loves me and knows how I’ll falter. That brings me peace knowing He knows me, who I am today, who I’ll develop into tomorrow.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Consecration</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-consecration.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Lehi, now in America after a long journey, sits his son, Jacob, down for a chat. He told him all his hard times would be rewarded:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall <strong>consecrate</strong> thine afflictions for thy gain. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.2">2 Nephi 2.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will <strong>consecrate</strong> thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9.html">2-nephi-32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To consecrate is to “make or declare something sacred” (Oxford), or “to devote or dedicate exclusively to a purpose”.</p>
<p>From this lens, Jacob’s trials (like all his brothers and sisters) could be declared sacred (for the purposes of the Lord) and dedicated to the Lord’s purposes and cause.</p>
<p>Likewise, through prayer we can consecrate all of our acts. We can make them sacred devotions. What would your life be like if every day you dedicated it to the Lord? Where you did everything with a sacred purpose and cause?</p>
<p>And what if He made all those things consecrated for your spiritual gain?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-consecration-gift-to-cloud.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Consecration feels fuzzy, but it’s just giving yourself to something greater. It’s a mindset"> # Meaning</p>
<p>I can find more ways to consecrate my day and actions. To give myself with greater purpose.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Shake off the Chains</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-shake-off-the-chains.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Keeping the commandments brings blessings:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.20">2 Nephi 1.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it. Keeping the commandments means being honest, being kind, being respectful, finding a way to help others. Not being lazy. Being productive.</p>
<p>Literally, nobody can prosper without keeping some commandment. Without finding a way to meet someone’s need.</p>
<p>I also like this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.23">2 Nephi 1.23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a rallying cry we can all relate to. We are all bound with chains in life. But we don’t have to be. The call to “rise up” is a call to shake the chains to hold you bound. Arise from the dust!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-breaking-free-from-the-chains.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Break free from the chains"> # Meaning</p>
<p>It makes me wonder: what are the chains that hold me bound? Perhaps there are limiting beliefs.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Obtaining a Promised Land</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-land-of-promise.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures-a-land-of-promise" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures: A Land of Promise</h1>
<p>I thought about the phrase “land of promise” in <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-2-receiving-a-promised-land.html">1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land</a> and there’s the verse in <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5.html">1 Nephi 5.5</a> where Lehi says “I have obtained a land of promise”. He says that years before arriving in the promised land.</p>
<p>But now, years later, he testifies:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>notwithstanding our afflictions, <strong>we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands</strong>; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.5">2 Nephi 1.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long did it take for them to receive that land? Many years. And many hardships. Lehi complained and was chastised at some point (1 Nephi 16). So the journey isn’t without its struggles.</p>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>The Lord is with us. Even if we complain and struggle, He wants to help us get to a better place, our promised lands.</p>
<p>We can be like Lehi and seek to obtain that personal vision. And receive a personal covenant of how the Lord wants to bless us in our lives.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Alternative Endings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-alternative-endings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Lehi and his family were prompted to leave Jerusalem before King Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed it in 586 BCE.</p>
<p>There must be that lingering doubt, when following the Lord, as in “what would life have been like otherwise?”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have seen a vision, in which I know that Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have perished. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.4">2 Nephi 1.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lehi knew the answer: had they stayed they would have perished.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">What if the alternative to the choices you made was actually a much worse life?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>We hardly ever get to know how it would otherwise have ended. What if you took job A over B? What if I hadn’t broken my wrist? What if I had moved into X house vs.&nbsp;Y - who would I have met?</p>
<p>I’m not sure we’re supposed to know how it could otherwise have turned out. I’m not sure it matters much, either. Because I’m sure there were a lot of good people who weren’t prompted like Lehi to leave. (Consider how Abinadi had to stay.)</p>
<p>So I take this as “that’s interesting.” In this case, Lehi got to know the alternative ending to the story. He got to learn that he had avoided destruction in Jerusalem and could instead finish his days peacefully in his promised land.</p>
<p>We also often compare our lives to how perhaps it could have been better (thanks social media). Do you ever wonder if it could have been worse had you not made that good choice in your life?</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 22 - His Covenants will be the key of the Gathering of Israel</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-22-gathered-by-his-covenants.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>There is so much doctrine packed in here. Nephi is talking about the Lord doing a “marvelous work”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it [the marvelous work] shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, <strong>unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham</strong>, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, <strong>in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel</strong>. Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they <strong>shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-22.9-12">1 Nephi 22.9–12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will restore His covenants. It doesn’t explicitly say “baptism, the sacrament, the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the endowment, and the sealing ordinance”, but that’s what Nephi is referring to.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-image-wheat-into-a-silo.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The Lord will gather us into His silo. This is His work, not ours.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Why doesn’t the Book of Mormon mention the sealing ordinance? The Melchizedek priesthood (the name of it)? The endowment? I’m not sure. But it’s fascinating how Joseph Smith translated this book but also received revelations to help finalize the structure of the church. # Meaning</p>
<p>This teaches me that…</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord cares about people who reject him. He will do His work among them. He won’t leave me even if I leave Him. That’s a powerful concept.</li>
<li>The covenants are the most important thing to focus on in the scriptures. Everything else is just context about how to best live them.</li>
<li>I am gathered when I keep my covenants. They are the thing that help me understand and connect with the Lord.</li>
</ul>

  <title>1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament</title>

<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>The Isaiah chapters in Nephi often get skipped. But if you skip them, we miss out on important doctrine, like how “baptism” appears in the Nephi version of Isaiah 48 but not in the King James Version.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or <strong>out of the waters of baptism</strong>, who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in truth nor in righteousness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-20.1">1 Nephi 20.1</a></p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Baptism</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>But if you compare to Isaiah 48, that line is not mentioned:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness. <a href="../scriptures/isaiah-48.1">Isaiah 48.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only reference to baptism in the Old Testament is found only in the chapter heading of 1 Kings 7:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The molten sea (baptismal font) rests on the backs of twelve oxen. <a href="../scriptures/1-kings-7">1 Kings 7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is clearly one of the “plain and precious” things taken, or lost in translation, from the Bible:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and <strong>also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away</strong>. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-13.26">1 Nephi 13.26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we know they practiced baptism in the Old Testament because Nephi lived and taught it, and the Pearl of Great Price talks about Adam’s baptism and ordination into the priesthood:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. 65 And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man. 66 And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever; 67 And thou art after the order of him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity. 68 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons. Amen. <a href="../scriptures/moses-6.64-68">Moses 6.64–68</a></p>

<ul>
<li>It was cool to notice this today, as that verse popped out to me and that word “baptism”. It makes me wonder what else was taken from these Isaiah chapters</li>
<li>How could Joseph Smith have ideated that baptism was in the Old Testament? All records we have are that Joseph wasn’t very literate or well known in the Bible. He didn’t even know that Jerusalem had a wall and had to ask Emma (<a href="../book-review/saints-book-1-the-standard-of-truth-1815-1846.html">Saints Book 1 The Standard of Truth 1815-1846</a>) This strengthens my testimony that he was inspired in translating it</li>
<li>It makes sense to me how valuable the Book of Mormon is to answer these longstanding questions.</li>
<li>Those who are of the house of Israel are those who are baptized. The baptized are adopted into the Abrahamic family. This is is consistent with Galatians 3:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise. <a href="../scriptures/galatians-3.27-29">Galatians 3.27–29</a></p>

<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>On Sunday I was thinking about <a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.html">Bread given freely, like His life</a>. It’s powerful to read this verse today:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, <strong>yieldeth himself</strong>, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-19.10">1 Nephi 19.10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also <a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-in-the-oven.html">Bread in the Oven</a> post touches here.</p>
<p>He gave His life freely. He yielded himself.</p>
<p>So much doctrine is packed in this one verse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ had all power. He was a deity.</li>
<li>He obeyed the father.</li>
<li>He fulfilled prophesy.</li>
<li>He was the God of Abraham. He is distinct from the Father.</li>
<li>It was prophesied he would resurrect. Prophets in America knew this.</li>
<li>There is a space between death and the resurrection. Christ lived in that space for 3 days.</li>
<li>There are prophets who have testified of the Lord whom we don’t have records from.</li>
<li>Jesus delivered the Israelites. → the Israelites then delivered him unto the cross.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Every scripture in the Book of Mormon can contain some or many truths about the Savior. There’s always something to learn.</p>
<p>Humility is the process of putting the Lord’s wishes above my own, as He put the Father’s wishes above perhaps his own (yet they are one).</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 18 - The Power of Prayer</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Nephi has two powerful verses about prayer:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-18.3">1 Nephi 18.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we pray often, we are shown great things. And then after he’s tied up and being beaten by his brothers. According to what he wrote, this is the first thing he did when he was released:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-18.21">1 Nephi 18.21</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do I turn to the Lord the moment something goes wrong? <a href="christianity/turn-to-god-not-your-idols.md">Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols</a></p>
<p>The winds in our life can cease when we turn to God.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 17 - He will strengthen us</title>

<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Consider how the Lord provided for Nephi and his people</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.<br>
And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he <strong>doth nourish them, and strengthen them</strong>, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-17.2-3">1 Nephi 17.2–3</a></p>

  <title>1 Nephi 16 - Christ Guides us in Unique Ways</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-16-christ-guides-us.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Lehi had a humbling experience as he was complaining at how hard the journey was:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-16.25">1 Nephi 16.25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Lord chastened Lehi, he pointed Lehi to the Liahona for next steps:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-16.26">1 Nephi 16.26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord was <em>already</em> speaking to Lehi, so why did he tell Lehi to look at the Liahona? Why not just tell him what next to do?</p>
<p>An interesting thing happened with the Brother of Jared as well:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. <strong>And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.14">Ether 2.14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-christ-standing-brother-of-jared.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Christ standing with the Brother of Jared in a cloud</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In this case, the Lord just told him the next steps: “Go to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built.” (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.16">Ether 2.16</a>)</p>
<p>Why did Lehi get a compass, and the Jaredites not? Why did the Lord point Lehi to get his answers from the compass, but just told brother of Jared what next to do?</p>
<p>Well, I’m sure it’s not so black and white. But the fact that there <em>is</em> a <em>black</em> and a <em>white</em> way in which the Lord teaches us is my point.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord tells us what to do (black). Sometimes he reminds us of the things he’s already given us (white). He reminds us of words from the scriptures. He reminds us of past prayers. He reminds us to pray.</p>
<p>And if we look more closely, we actually <em>do</em> see a similarity between Brother of Jared and Lehi because they “built barges after the manner which they <strong>had</strong> built, according to the instructions of the Lord.” (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.16">Ether 2.16</a>)</p>
<p>Meaning: they already had the answer and the Lord just had to remind them.</p>
<p>Meaning: their liahona was the fact that they already had directions from the Lord.</p>
<p>Let’s go back a little. Earlier in Jaredite journey, they were being very deliberately lead by the Lord:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and <strong>gave directions whither they should travel.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.5">Ether 2.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but the Lord gave them instructions on how to build a barge:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and <strong>did build barges</strong>, in which <strong>they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.6">Ether 2.6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Lehi and Brother of Jared were both pointed in the direction they should go. But the Lord teaches them each in their own way. For Lehi he gives him a Liahona and tells him to read the words therein. This is a physical tool, kind of like the Book of Mormon and other scripture. We should not be surprised if sometimes the Lord tells us “go to the scriptures, I will answer your question there” or “listen to general conference”. The Lord often points us to places where He’ll speak to us, giving us opportunities to show our faith and do our part.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes he may guide us by the hand and show us the way to go. He may directly just tell us to go one way. This is another way of His for interacting with us.</p>
<p>And interestingly, he later told brother of Jared “remember those barges I gave you four years ago? Rebuild more.” He didn’t necessarily give them more designs but reminded the Jaredites of how he had already guided them.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>There is power in remembering the things the Lord has already done for us. We shouldn’t always seek new signs. We should seek to remember. And in remembering, we’re lead anew.</p>
<section id="what-i-learned" class="level1">
<h1>What I Learned</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Lord guides the same person in different ways</li>
<li>He guides two people in the same circumstance in different ways</li>
<li>He asks us to remember</li>
<li>If we’ve embarked on the journey, even if we stumble, he’ll lovingly chastise us to remember the Way</li>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>I take solice in that He wants to guide me personally. He may ask me to read my scriptures. He may remind me of a past time. He may give me specific instructions. He may just expect me to walk or build and do the thing I’m supposed to do. Keep going until you receive further instruction.</p>
<p>He’s also actually heavily involved in the details it seems. We may wander lost (Israelites) or be caught relaxing for four years on the beach (Jaredites), but He’s still very heavily involved. I can trust He loves me and wants to guide me.</p>

  <title>Bread given freely, like His life</title>

<p>All are welcome. Everyone. He doesn’t want a skimpy congregation. He wants it packed. The bread is offered to everyone, the way His life was.</p>
<p>Likewise, his life was freely given. Free. He had control. And He gives the sacrament freely to all who see it.</p>
</section>
<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p><em>All</em> are invited to participate in the sacrament, which is symbolic of the life He freely gave. All souls in the chapel are invited to partake of His goodness.</p>
<p>Only He could give up His life:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A natural effect of His immortal origin, as the earth-born Son of an immortal Sire, was that He was immune to death except as He surrendered thereto. <strong>The life of Jesus the Christ could not be taken save as He willed and allowed. The power to lay down His life was inherent in Himself, as was the power to take up His slain body in an immortalized state.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/chapter-25.-jesus-again-in-jerusalem">Chapter 25. Jesus Again in Jerusalem</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ alone was given power by God to control the fate of his otherwise immortal body:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. <strong>No man taketh it from me</strong>, but I lay it down of myself. <strong>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</strong> This commandment have I received of my Father. <a href="../scriptures/john-10.17-18">John 10.17–18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By similar rite, all are welcome. He is in control.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not; <a href="../scriptures/3-nephi-18.22">3 Nephi 18.22</a></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Because Christ had a choice, and not the Romans, over the timing of His death, and He chose to be taken in captivity, and He chose to walk up the hill, the Lord showed he did all that He could to offer Himself to us.</p>
<p>When I pray, I’m not praying to an unknown God. I’m praying to one who fully understands me (<a href="../sacrament-symbols/porous-bread.html">Porous Bread</a>).</p>
<p>When I pray, I can remember He’s already done His part. The only thing holding me back from feeling His love is me.</p>
<p>How can I pray in such a way to lower those barriers that I put up between Him and me ?</p>

<p>We show up to take the sacrament in our Sunday best. There were many “sinners” who came and adored the Lord. A lady gave him oil and washed His feet. The widow gave two mites. The publicans prayed for forgiveness while the Pharisees judged them.</p>
<p>We give Him our best when we show up, as sinners, to offer Him a broken heart and contrite spirit.</p>

<p>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat. 37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. <a href="../scriptures/luke-7.36-38">Luke 7.36–38</a></p>

<p>The sacrament isn’t for those who are perfect. It’s for me, a sinner. One who sins. And is sinning and doesn’t even know it. One who is separated from the happiness God would have me fully feel because of my ignorance, my natural state. I am good. I am loved. When I pray, He already knows I’m a sinner and loves me regardless. He doesn’t want me to see myself as a sinner, but as a worshipper who has much to grow from. And I am growing.</p>

  <title>Broken Bread, but No Broken Bones</title>

<section id="symbol" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Symbol</h1>
<p>We break bread, but His bones were not broken. Only His flesh.</p>

</div>
</section>
<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Whenever we break the bread, I’m reminded of many things. But one that sticks out is that Christ’s legs were commanded to be broken by the Roman leaders:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Jewish officials, who had not hesitated to slay their Lord, were horrified at the thought of men left hanging on crosses on such a day, for thereby the land would be defiled; so these scrupulous <strong>rulers went to Pilate and begged that Jesus and the two malefactors be summarily dispatched by the brutal Roman method of breaking their legs</strong>, the shock of which violent treatment had been found to be promptly fatal to the crucified. <a href="../scriptures/Jesus-the-Christ-chapter-35.-death-and-burial.html">Jesus the Christ. Chapter 35. Death and Burial</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a technique practiced by the Romans to hasten the death of the crucified:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Victims in the head up position could spend several days on the cross before they died. <strong>One technique used by the Romans to hasten death was to break the legs below the knee with a blunt instrument1 (p.&nbsp;25)</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420788/#">Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion - PMC</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit graphic, but how did this technique possibly accelerate the death?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>According to those who have studied the grim mechanics of crucifixion, in order to breathe adequately, the crucified victim periodically had to push himself up using his legs. <strong>Breaking the legs prevented him from doing that, thus hastening his death. He would suffocate.</strong> <a href="https://www.stcatherinercc.org/single-post/2018/03/14/why-are-the-crucified-persons-legs-broken">Why are the crucified persons’ legs broken?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Christ’s legs were <em>not</em> broken as instructed. Continuing the quote above from Jesus the Christ:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>…The governor gave his consent, and the soldiers broke the limbs of the two thieves with cudgels. <strong>Jesus, however, was found to be already dead, so they broke not His bones.</strong> Christ, the great Passover sacrifice, of whom all altar victims had been but suggestive prototypes, died through violence yet without a bone of His body being broken, as was a prescribed condition of the slain paschal lambs. <a href="../scriptures/Jesus-the-Christ-chapter-35.-death-and-burial.html">Jesus the Christ. Chapter 35. Death and Burial</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Why weren’t the bones broken? Why is this significant?</p>
<p>The bones of a paschal lamb were meant <em>not</em> to be broken.</p>
<p>It dates back to the Mosiac Passover in Egypt (when the firstborns of the Egyptians and the Pharaoh were killed)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; <strong>neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/exodus-12.46">Exodus 12.46</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. <a href="../scriptures/numbers-9.12">Numbers 9.12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was prophesied that “Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. <strong>He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken</strong>.” (<a href="../scriptures/psalm-34.19-20">Psalm 34.19–20</a>)</p>
<p>John testified of the fulfillment of this prophecy:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, <strong>they brake not his legs:</strong> <a href="../scriptures/john-19.31-33">John 19.31–33</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. <a href="../scriptures/john-19.36">John 19.36</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while we break the bread, His bones were not broken. Just His flesh.</p>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>The details that were fulfilled at His death remind me of His prophetic life. The fact that he was killed according to the law, and the law predated him and is scripture in the Torah, is further evidence that Christ truly lived and that his life was a fulfillment of prophecy.</p>
<p>Likewise, those same details apply to my life. He is involved in those details. <a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a></p>

<p>Bread is porous.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the sacrament, the bread (flesh) is first broken, then the water (blood) is administered.</li>
<li>Blood follows broken flesh. Blood flowed through the broken flesh. The pores of the flesh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bread, being porous, is also absorbent. → He absorbed our problems. He internalized them inside His flesh to the point that his own blood didn’t have space internally anymore and exited through the pores.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-3.7">Mosiah 3.7</a></p>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>The Savior suffered an enormous amount. Even the thought of imagining blood coming out of my pores evokes thoughts of feeling so much physically overwhelming internal pressure or emotional agony that it would make a human body explode.</p>
<p>I can remember this when I pray. I can feel heard because He not only felt what I feel today, but he knows the future me, the past me, and the past/present/future everyone else. When I pray, I’m not approaching a distant God. I’m approaching the one that understands humanity better than any human possibly could. Someone that understands me more than I’ll ever understand myself. Someone who’s been there.</p>
<p>When I pray, I don’t have to give pretenses, because “your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.” (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-6.8">Matthew 6.8</a>)</p>

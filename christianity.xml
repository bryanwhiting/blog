<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Blessings for keeping the commandments (the commandment of tithing):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not <strong>open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</strong> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. <a href="../scriptures/malachi-3.10-11">Malachi 3.10–11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord invites us to drink his blood, to drink if we are thirsty:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: <strong>I will pour my spirit upon thy seed</strong>, and my blessing upon thine offspring: <a href="../scriptures/isaiah-44.3">Isaiah 44.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blessings will be poured out on those who covenant with Christ:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands <strong>shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out</strong>, and the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house. And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads of my people. <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-110.9-10">Doctrine and Covenants 110.9–10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The covenant of baptism is about pouring the spirit upon us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, <strong>that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</strong> <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.10">Mosiah 18.10</a> O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.12">Mosiah 18.12</a> Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a <strong>testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body</strong>; and <strong>may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you</strong>; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.13">Mosiah 18.13</a></p>
</blockquote>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>When I take the sacrament, I renew a covenant which binds me to a Lord who is eager and capable of pouring out blessings. He does not deliver in vain. He does not deliver spitefully. He does not deliver like a carrot on a stick. In short, he is not human.</p>
<p>He delivers bountifully, readily, excitedly. When we rejoice, he rejoices (<a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.9">Mosiah 18.9</a>). It pleases Him to bless us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, <strong>that my joy might remain in you</strong>, and that your joy might be full. <a href="../scriptures/john-15.10-11">John 15.10–11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His work is one of joy:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. <a href="../scriptures/luke-15.5-7">Luke 15.5–7</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - Heaven and Hell in One</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-heaven-and-hell.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>This quote focuses on the dichotomy people feel as they draw closer to Christ. First, they have the desire. Second, they have positive experiences. Third, they doubt their worthiness. Or they wish that all the good things could prevent them from sinning again:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions? 27 And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy? <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.26-27">2 Nephi 4.26–27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-heaven-and-hell.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Heaven and Hell"> # Meaning</p>
<p>The Lord wants us to grow. Sometimes that involves choosing to see the good in an experience.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - Love and Despair</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-love-and-despair.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>2 Nephi 4 has two interesting scriptures:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine a human who has felt so much love to describe it as the consuming of his flesh, yet have perhaps a degree of self loathing because of his sins? That he’d like to be happy but he can’t because he knows what he’s done wrong?</p>
<p>I think anyone who is a human can empathize.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-peace-vs-despair.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Same person, same feelings"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Humanity is about building a relationship with God. God is about letting us have agency. He doesn’t expect us to be perfect. He expects us to be human, but guides us to perfection. In some sense He demands it, knowing we’ll fall short.</p>
<p>But we can take comfort in that He will bless us even when we feel undeserving.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - A Prophecy of Another Branch</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-prophecy-of-another-branch.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.2">2 Nephi 4.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another powerful reminder of things lost from the Bible, similar to <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-20-baptism-in-the-old-testament.html">1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament</a>. As we look at 2 Nephi 3:5, we see a link to the Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die, and go unto my fathers; and I go down to my grave with joy. The God of my father Jacob be with you, to deliver you out of affliction in the days of your bondage; for the Lord hath visited me, and I have obtained a promise of the Lord, <strong>that out of the fruit of my loins, the Lord God will raise up a righteous branch out of my loins</strong>; and unto thee, whom my father Jacob hath named Israel, a prophet; (not the Messiah who is called Shilo;) and this prophet shall deliver my people out of Egypt in the days of thy bondage. <a href="../scriptures/jst,-genesis-50.24">JST, Genesis 50.24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine if for 2000 years the entire world knew about this prophecy and the other things in 50:24-38 # Meaning</p>

  <title>Coalesce - Revelation first, then Agency</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/coalesce-revelation-first-then-agency.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Some believe in pre-destiny. That their life is predetermined.</p>
<p>Some believe there is no God and they have to do the best they can with what they’ve got, because that’s all they’ve got.</p>
<p>The truth lies somewhere in between. There <em>is</em> a God, <em>and</em> He wants us to be agents (<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.28.html">Doctrine and Covenants 58.28</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-plan-a-and-b.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Life is filled with choices and many actions to perform"> In data science, there’s a concept called “coalesce”. In English it means to come together and make one whole. In software, it means to fill in missing data with a default value.</p>
<p>Forgive the nerd talk, but bear with me here: So if you have an empty spreadsheet, and you do the operation <code>coalesce(spreadsheet, 5)</code> it would return the spreadsheet’s value if you had data in the spreadsheet but the number 5 if you had a missing cell. So if you have 10 rows of data in Excel but 3 missing rows, the output would be the 7 original values with 3 cells now with 5 in them. It’s a way of handling missing data, because missing data creates problems.</p>
<p>What is the missing data in our personal lives? It’s “what do we do?” What do we do today? Tomorrow? Next year? What do we do today and tomorrow to prepare for the thing we may want to do next year?</p>
<p>I’ve realized the healthy way to have a relationship with personal revelation is to operate under the constraints of a coalesce. To be whole and one with the Lord, our goal should be to coalesce.</p>
<p>Some rely too much on the spirit. Hoping God will make a choice for us. But he gave us agency. He lost 1/3 of his children because he didn’t want to give up agency. And, by that right, he’s willing to lose you and me too if we’re not willing to exercise our agency. We just choose. This is life. And we must choose Him.</p>
<p>In many things, there is a commandment we can rely on. Don’t kill. Don’t steal. Be honest. Pay tithing.</p>
<p>That’s the priority.</p>
<p>Then there’s the gray area stuff: love our neighbor.</p>
<p>That’s the agency.</p>
<p>Then there’s the really gray area: have joy. Among this is “provide for a family” and “raise them the best way you can”.</p>
<p>So, use a coalesce. Your default value is what <em>you</em> want to do. That’s what you fill in.</p>
<p>Our life should be <code>coalesce(personal revelation, our agency)</code>.</p>
<p>Where there’s a commandment or personal revelation from the Lord, do it. Don’t wait. Do it. Follow the prompting. Otherwise, if you have no prompting or commandment to follow, make a choice! Learn. Experience. Enjoy.</p>
<p>I believe the Lord will support us when we follow a pattern of putting Him first, and then defaulting to doing many good things of our own free will and choice when He hasn’t given us instruction.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean he doesn’t care what we do. He cares deeply. It’s just more like <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23.html">Ether 2.23</a> where he wants us to come up with some good ideas.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 Ask</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-ask.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Do you believe in what Nephi came to know?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.35">2 Nephi 4.35</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the limitations we can put on the Lord? Here are a few that get me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord wants me to struggle on this one</li>
<li>I don’t want to ask too much</li>
<li>This isn’t that big of a deal. I should pray about more important things instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these are easily contradicted by scriptures. He <em>does</em> want us to struggle but struggle <em>with</em> him and overcome (<a href="../scriptures/1-corinthians-10.13">1 Corinthians 10.13</a>). The Lord wants us to ask for all the blessings He’s capable of giving us (<a href="../scriptures/malachi-3.10">Malachi 3.10</a>), and pour out endless blessings.<sup>1</sup> And lastly, the Lord works by small and simple means (<a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps instead those three things should be exactly what we pray for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can we struggle on together? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30.html">Matthew 11.28–30</a>)</li>
<li>What’s the gift that thou art willing to bless me with? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-6.8.html">Matthew 6.8</a> )</li>
<li>What’s the smallest piece of help I could possibly ask for? (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23">Ether 2.23</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase “ask not amiss” isn’t some indication that a secret code needs to be enacted. That to unlock the heavens, the prayer needs to be offered in the right way at the right time by the right person.</p>
<p>How can you ask amiss? The scriptures teach us. If we’re selfish, seek our own, are puffed up, are easily provoked, want revenge, are greedy, etc. then we’re asking amiss.</p>
<p>But if we’re trying to do our best to be good people and dealing with the challenging responsibilities of being a father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, neighbor, coworker, manager, etc. then we’re just dealing with life.</p>
<p>What is life without these titles? Who doesn’t work? Who doesn’t have someone to care for?</p>
<p>It’s precisely <em>these</em> things that are worthy of our prayers and divine supplication.</p>

<p><a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a> is a theme I’ve tried this year. I’ve grown deeply in finding healing by making sure I can have a private place to pray.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen how prayers have been answered in ways I didn’t expect. That something comes unexpectedly and it turns out to be really good. But it wasn’t in the plans.</p>
<p>This is kind of like a personal manna. God delivers. Not expected. But welcomed.</p>

<p>What’s enticing you right now?</p>

<p>Can you make a decision without being presented at least two options?</p>
<p>If you feel like you made a decision on something, what did you decide and what was the alternative option?</p>
<p>If you’re torn about a decision, why? What’s on the other side?</p>

<p>Life is full of enticing things. Sometimes, self defeating thoughts can be enticing. We have a bias towards negativity as humans. But thankfully we always have a choice.</p>
<p>Recognize the behavior. And then find the perhaps less <em>enticing</em> but far more healthy thought pattern.</p>

<p>We take the sacrament as a congregation, as one unified body.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-one-congregation-feasting.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="We partake as one congregation"> # Scriptures</p>
<p>When the sacrament was first administered, there was one bread and one cup.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; <a href="../scriptures/matthew-26.26-27">Matthew 26.26–27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine being in that room with Him? Drinking the sacrament for the first time?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; <strong>One Lord, one faith, one baptism,</strong> One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. <a href="../scriptures/ephesians-4.1-7">Ephesians 4.1–7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what it means when we gather together. We are one. We all rely on the same One Savior. We’ve all made the same one baptismal covenant. We all worship the same One God.</p>
<p>We all renew the same One covenant, which is a covenant to love and serve each other with His love.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - His Capacity to Carry Our Burdens</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-he-carries-our-burdens.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>The Savior is known to have offered himself as a sacrifice for our sins:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.7">2 Nephi 2.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that’s not all He sacrificed himself for:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. <a href="../scriptures/isaiah-53.4">Isaiah 53.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did He specify which griefs? Which sorrows?</p>
<p>I think sometimes we can limit in our minds which sorrows. But since He doesn’t specify, it’s probably all sorrows. Yes. Actually, not probably. It <em>is</em> all sorrows.</p>
<p>The time in middle school you were teased and you cried. The time in college you failed that test and wondered what the future would hold. The time your loved one passed away. The time you got rejected in some interview/deal/relationship/etc. Those sorrows.</p>
<p>If you haven’t felt any of these sorrows, I question if you’ve even lived…</p>
<p>The Lord’s rest ironically comes when we take His yoke upon us. Just like he wants us to <a href="sacrament-symbols/receive-the-holy-ghost.md">Receive the Holy Ghost</a>, he wants us to receive His yoke. He wants us to join Him:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. <a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30">Matthew 11.28–30</a></p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>When praying, it may increase the power of a prayer by holding in mind the imagery of the Savior beckoning us to be by His side. To be yoked with him.</p>
<p>When we do, perhaps we’ll see how close He is to us. How much he knows us. But we have to come to Him to feel that. He comes to us to invite us, but it’s only when we turn to Him that we truly feel He is with us.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Redemption</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-redemption.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Notice the words “in” and “through”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.6">2 Nephi 2.6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This provides some meaningful words. Rambling a bit here:</p>
<ul>
<li>in: because of?</li>
<li>through: by means of</li>
</ul>
<p>How are these two words different? One, Christ is a Being. He’s not an “amorphous entity”. By means of what He did for us, we can be redeemed. But it’s also because of who He is (presently as the Living Christ) in granting us forgiveness.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-risen-christ-by-the-tomb-redemption.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Risen Christ"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Christ’s atonement is infinite. It’s empowering to know that he’s already suffered for my sins of today and yesterday as well as tomorrow and beyond. Meaning, he already knows the mistakes I’m going to choose to make, which is kind of trippy in a way, but also comforting thinking about how He still loves me and knows how I’ll falter. That brings me peace knowing He knows me, who I am today, who I’ll develop into tomorrow.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Consecration</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-consecration.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Lehi, now in America after a long journey, sits his son, Jacob, down for a chat. He told him all his hard times would be rewarded:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall <strong>consecrate</strong> thine afflictions for thy gain. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.2">2 Nephi 2.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will <strong>consecrate</strong> thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9.html">2-nephi-32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To consecrate is to “make or declare something sacred” (Oxford), or “to devote or dedicate exclusively to a purpose”.</p>
<p>From this lens, Jacob’s trials (like all his brothers and sisters) could be declared sacred (for the purposes of the Lord) and dedicated to the Lord’s purposes and cause.</p>
<p>Likewise, through prayer we can consecrate all of our acts. We can make them sacred devotions. What would your life be like if every day you dedicated it to the Lord? Where you did everything with a sacred purpose and cause?</p>
<p>And what if He made all those things consecrated for your spiritual gain?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-consecration-gift-to-cloud.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Consecration feels fuzzy, but it’s just giving yourself to something greater. It’s a mindset"> # Meaning</p>
<p>I can find more ways to consecrate my day and actions. To give myself with greater purpose.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Shake off the Chains</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-shake-off-the-chains.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Keeping the commandments brings blessings:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.20">2 Nephi 1.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it. Keeping the commandments means being honest, being kind, being respectful, finding a way to help others. Not being lazy. Being productive.</p>
<p>Literally, nobody can prosper without keeping some commandment. Without finding a way to meet someone’s need.</p>
<p>I also like this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.23">2 Nephi 1.23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a rallying cry we can all relate to. We are all bound with chains in life. But we don’t have to be. The call to “rise up” is a call to shake the chains to hold you bound. Arise from the dust!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-breaking-free-from-the-chains.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Break free from the chains"> # Meaning</p>
<p>It makes me wonder: what are the chains that hold me bound? Perhaps there are limiting beliefs.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Obtaining a Promised Land</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures-a-land-of-promise" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures: A Land of Promise</h1>
<p>I thought about the phrase “land of promise” in <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-2-receiving-a-promised-land.html">1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land</a> and there’s the verse in <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5.html">1 Nephi 5.5</a> where Lehi says “I have obtained a land of promise”. He says that years before arriving in the promised land.</p>
<p>But now, years later, he testifies:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>notwithstanding our afflictions, <strong>we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands</strong>; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.5">2 Nephi 1.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long did it take for them to receive that land? Many years. And many hardships. Lehi complained and was chastised at some point (1 Nephi 16). So the journey isn’t without its struggles.</p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>The Lord is with us. Even if we complain and struggle, He wants to help us get to a better place, our promised lands.</p>
<p>We can be like Lehi and seek to obtain that personal vision. And receive a personal covenant of how the Lord wants to bless us in our lives.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Alternative Endings</title>

<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Lehi and his family were prompted to leave Jerusalem before King Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed it in 586 BCE.</p>
<p>There must be that lingering doubt, when following the Lord, as in “what would life have been like otherwise?”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have seen a vision, in which I know that Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have perished. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.4">2 Nephi 1.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lehi knew the answer: had they stayed they would have perished.</p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>We hardly ever get to know how it would otherwise have ended. What if you took job A over B? What if I hadn’t broken my wrist? What if I had moved into X house vs.&nbsp;Y - who would I have met?</p>
<p>I’m not sure we’re supposed to know how it could otherwise have turned out. I’m not sure it matters much, either. Because I’m sure there were a lot of good people who weren’t prompted like Lehi to leave. (Consider how Abinadi had to stay.)</p>
<p>So I take this as “that’s interesting.” In this case, Lehi got to know the alternative ending to the story. He got to learn that he had avoided destruction in Jerusalem and could instead finish his days peacefully in his promised land.</p>
<p>We also often compare our lives to how perhaps it could have been better (thanks social media). Do you ever wonder if it could have been worse had you not made that good choice in your life?</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 22 - His Covenants will be the key of the Gathering of Israel</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-22-gathered-by-his-covenants.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>There is so much doctrine packed in here. Nephi is talking about the Lord doing a “marvelous work”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it [the marvelous work] shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, <strong>unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham</strong>, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, <strong>in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel</strong>. Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they <strong>shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-22.9-12">1 Nephi 22.9–12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will restore His covenants. It doesn’t explicitly say “baptism, the sacrament, the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the endowment, and the sealing ordinance”, but that’s what Nephi is referring to.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">The Lord will gather us into His silo. This is His work, not ours.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Why doesn’t the Book of Mormon mention the sealing ordinance? The Melchizedek priesthood (the name of it)? The endowment? I’m not sure. But it’s fascinating how Joseph Smith translated this book but also received revelations to help finalize the structure of the church. # Meaning</p>
<p>This teaches me that…</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord cares about people who reject him. He will do His work among them. He won’t leave me even if I leave Him. That’s a powerful concept.</li>
<li>The covenants are the most important thing to focus on in the scriptures. Everything else is just context about how to best live them.</li>
<li>I am gathered when I keep my covenants. They are the thing that help me understand and connect with the Lord.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Lord reminds us he had not forgotten us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me—but he will show that he hath not. 15 For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel. 16 Behold, I <strong>have graven thee upon the palms of my hands</strong>; thy walls are continually before me. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-21.14-16">1 Nephi 21.14–16</a></p>

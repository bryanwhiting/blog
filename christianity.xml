<p>Thinking on <a href="../christianity/a-foundation-on-christ.html">A foundation on Christ</a>, I wondered: what is my “foundation model?”</p>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>In machine learning there’s all this talk of foundation models. If you have a bad foundation model, you can’t build good software.</p>
<p>Likewise, the quality of a prediction system is in the data. And in the model. And upon that I can build a system.</p>
<p>And the quality of my testimony is based on how much I put Christ as my guide, inspiration, and foundation.</p>

<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Today in Sunday school we studied Helaman 5:12:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall. <a href="../scriptures/helaman-5.12">Helaman 5.12</a></p>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>In reading <a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>, a big section is dedicated to the tale of two selves: the experiencing self and the remembering self.</p>
<p>The peak-end bias is that despite enjoying several hours or years of an experience, we only remember the high and the end. This happens in movies - if you don’t like how it ends you hate the movie. If you don’t like the bill you won’t remember the food you just ate.</p>
<p>I was sick this week, laying on the ground unable to move much with some food poisoning. I said a prayer to have a positive experience, or to learn something. And I did! While sick I was just impressed at how my body was able to instinctively know what to do to fight the illness.</p>
<p>And now I look back and I’m almost glad I had that experience. It taught me some important things.</p>
<p>That’s the power I’ve felt of building a foundation on Christ. When I’m challenged, I know I can seek the Lord (it’s easier to remember this with a physical sickness than many other things in life). And when I do, He both helps the experiencing self and the remembering self. He consecrates those experiences for our good <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9.html">2-nephi-32.9</a> .</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He will consecrate both hard and good things for our good.</p>

<h1>Symbol</h1>
<p>I thought of a funeral today while taking the sacrament. Everyone here is attending a funeral: in memory of our Savior.</p>
<p>We remember Him. We talk of Him. We celebrate His life.</p>
<p>Most people show up to a funeral dressed in black. But he resurrected in white. And in the temple, we dress in white as He was resurrected.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-bought-with-a-price.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Bought with a price"> # Scriptures</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>For ye are bought with a price</strong>: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s. <a href="../scriptures/1-corinthians-6.20">1 Corinthians 6.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and <strong>am your advocate with the Father</strong>; and it is his good will to give you the kingdom. <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-29.5">Doctrine and Covenants 29.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Listen to him <strong>who is the advocate</strong> with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him— 4 Saying: Father, <strong>behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin,</strong> in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified; 5 Wherefore, Father, <strong>spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-45.3-5">Doctrine and Covenants 45.3–5</a></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>One distinction between a funeral and a sacrament memorial service is that usually at a funeral you don’t focus on how they died. It’s too painful, especially if the death was unanticipated.</p>
<p>But at a sacrament meeting we take His bread, broken to symbolize the broken body. And we drink the water, to symbolize the blood that he shed in the garden, that he spilled on the cross under a crown of thorns and a litany of nails.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because His life would have no value if He didn’t die for us. And he died for us. And how he died is relevant because it’s the price He paid for us. And knowing we’ve been bought with a price matters because it means we’re bound to him.</p>
<p>Remembering His death and how He died reminds me that I want to live like He did.</p>
<p>He didn’t just die. How He died is everything. He died bleeding for us. He died with His last breath for us, instead of for Him. He didn’t just accept His place on the cross, He exchanged His physical life for our eternal lives. Barabbas was freed in exchange for Him, and we are Barabbas. We are the wicked sinners freed as He went guiltless to the execution. Can you imagine His disciples sitting in the chanting crowd and thinking: “you’re releasing the wrong man! One convicted for his crimes, the other convicted by those who hate their Messiah!” Yet they didn’t know that they’re as far from God in some ways as Barabbas is…</p>
<p>And despite all the pain we put Him through, He is our Advocate.</p>

  <title>Jacob 1 - Viewing Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/jacob-1-viewing-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to <strong>provoke him</strong> to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and <strong>view his death,</strong> and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi. <a href="../scriptures/jacob-1.8">Jacob 1.8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ was clearly angry when he flipped the market at the temple. And it’s said he’s a “jealous” God and has his wrath and such.</p>
<p>God won’t be mocked. But he’s the first to love and forgive us. So when we bring upon us his wrath, I see this as we’re bringing upon ourselves the consequences of our own actions. The wrath was determined when He made the law. But it’s better said “we bring upon ourselves the wrath of breaking his commandments” than “provoke him to anger”, for Charity sufferers long and is Kind and is not easily provoked. For He is Charity.</p>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>It’s much healthier for me to see the commandments as immutable as gravity. Drop something, it’ll brake. Face the wrath of the hardwood floor. But God is quite in control. Quite loving. Quite fair and just.</p>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/building-a-story-brand.html">Building a Story Brand</a>, I was impressed by the author’s philosophy on giving away things. His time. Resources. Knowledge. He challenged the notion that in business you should charge for everything. Instead he sought to give away as much as he could. His business has grown pretty well.</p>
<p>There’s also the principle of reciprocity, well studied in <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a>. When we give, people feel a social debt and want to repay it even more than what was given.</p>
<p>Both of these things are taught by the Savior’s desire for us to give freely, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” (<a href="../scriptures/acts-20.35">Acts 20.35</a>)</p>
<p>Consider the design: instill in people a desire to repay debts. When one person gives, other people give more back. Then the first person wants to give because a surplus was given to them. And then and then and then. More giving.</p>
<p>I reviewed this in <a href="../gratitude/marriage.html">I’m Grateful for Marriage</a>, the parable of the no-elbow people. Better to give.</p>

  <title>Easter, the most important holiday</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/easter-the-most-important-holiday.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today is #Easter, the most important holiday of the year for Christians, and perhaps the most radical and profound holiday for the world. It shows the most #inclusive</p>
<p>On this day, nearly 2,000 years ago, it is believed that Jesus Christ, considered the Son of God, resurrected from the tomb. He was the first to rise from the dead, and then gave power to others to resurrect.</p>
<p>Consider the hope this offers. Death is only momentary. Everlasting life awaits for us all.</p>
<p>Here’s what Jesus did that was incredibly kind, selfless and #inclusive:</p>
<ul>
<li>He first appeared to Mary, a woman. He frequently “broke the rules” by spending time with those society marginalized, and forgiving the sins of people worthy of death.</li>
<li>He told his followers to share His gospel with the world. It was no longer restricted to just the Israelites (of which Jews are one of twelve houses)</li>
<li>He shared the gospel with the dead, who live as spirits on the other side. He freed the captive spirits.</li>
</ul>
<p>#DEI #Diversity</p>

  <title>Easter Study: Seek Miracles</title>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the same way, the Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, “doubting nothing.” Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith. I promise that you can experience for yourself that Jesus Christ “giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.” Few things will accelerate your spiritual momentum more than realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life. <a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-the-power-of-spiritual-momentum">“The Power of Spiritual Momentum”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Reading this gives me pause. I have always thought not to seek for signs. “A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh signs” or what not. But this is different. This is seeking miracles, which is the Lord’s hand in our life.</p>
<p>If I seek a miracle, I seek Jesus’ hand in my life. His healing. His advice. His teachings. Those are and were His miracles.</p>

<h1>Lesson</h1>
<p>Know: What the apostasy is. What a prophet is. Feel: that they’re alive at a special time. Do: ask Heavenly Father if this church is the true church. And keep asking.</p>
<p>Activity: - apostasy. - Every boy is a prophet. - They need to invite people to repent. Repent and come unto Jesus. - Everyone else throws things at them. - Ask: who would you rather be - the one listening or preaching? - Have a pause for one minute of silence for how long the time was that they didn’t have a prophet.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 27 The Purpose of the Book of Mormon</title>

<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>This chapter doesn’t lay about all the purposes of the Book of Mormon, but it lays out some.</p>
<p>Purpose: help people eat and be filled. The souls who aren’t fed are like hungry men who dream of eating but awake empty.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.3">2 Nephi 27.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book is a revelation. It’s a miracle in itself. It’s a witness of all things, and a testament of its translator.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.7">2 Nephi 27.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be a revelation of the doctrines that have been taught since the foundation of the world and will be taught until the end of it:<sup>1</sup></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.11">2 Nephi 27.11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence that this is the Lord’s work, because he turned a plow boy into a translator of a sealed book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.20">2 Nephi 27.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will do a marvelous work through this book. It’ll be the means of converting people to Him and His gospel:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.26">2 Nephi 27.26</a></p>

<p>I think I’ve always assumed that Nephi saw the restoration and then saw the second coming. And that’s it. That’s kind of how it reads.</p>
<p>But as I ponder this I wonder how much he saw. Did he see 2024? Did he see what my people would be going through? Probably. Perhaps.</p>
<p>Assuming he did, and that this was written about today, what are the churches that have risen up to get gain? Probably people with pride in their heart.</p>

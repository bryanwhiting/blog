  <title>Easter Study: Seek Miracles</title>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the same way, the Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, “doubting nothing.” Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith. I promise that you can experience for yourself that Jesus Christ “giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.” Few things will accelerate your spiritual momentum more than realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life. <a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-the-power-of-spiritual-momentum">“The Power of Spiritual Momentum”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>

<p>Reading this gives me pause. I have always thought not to seek for signs. “A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh signs” or what not. But this is different. This is seeking miracles, which is the Lord’s hand in our life.</p>
<p>If I seek a miracle, I seek Jesus’ hand in my life. His healing. His advice. His teachings. Those are and were His miracles.</p>

<p>I want these young men to come away with an appreciation for the restoration of the gospel and how the Book of Mormon plays a role in their lives.</p>
<p>How do I get a seven year old class to appreciate the Book of Mormon? The restoration?</p>

<h1>Lesson</h1>
<p>Know: What the apostasy is. What a prophet is. Feel: that they’re alive at a special time. Do: ask Heavenly Father if this church is the true church. And keep asking.</p>
<p>Activity: - apostasy. - Every boy is a prophet. - They need to invite people to repent. Repent and come unto Jesus. - Everyone else throws things at them. - Ask: who would you rather be - the one listening or preaching? - Have a pause for one minute of silence for how long the time was that they didn’t have a prophet.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 27 The Purpose of the Book of Mormon</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-27-the-purpose-of-the-book-of-mormon.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>This chapter doesn’t lay about all the purposes of the Book of Mormon, but it lays out some.</p>
<p>Purpose: help people eat and be filled. The souls who aren’t fed are like hungry men who dream of eating but awake empty.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.3">2 Nephi 27.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book is a revelation. It’s a miracle in itself. It’s a witness of all things, and a testament of its translator.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.7">2 Nephi 27.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be a revelation of the doctrines that have been taught since the foundation of the world and will be taught until the end of it:<sup>1</sup></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.11">2 Nephi 27.11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence that this is the Lord’s work, because he turned a plow boy into a translator of a sealed book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.20">2 Nephi 27.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will do a marvelous work through this book. It’ll be the means of converting people to Him and His gospel:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.26">2 Nephi 27.26</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-26.20">2 Nephi 26.20</a></p>

<p>I think I’ve always assumed that Nephi saw the restoration and then saw the second coming. And that’s it. That’s kind of how it reads.</p>
<p>But as I ponder this I wonder how much he saw. Did he see 2024? Did he see what my people would be going through? Probably. Perhaps.</p>
<p>Assuming he did, and that this was written about today, what are the churches that have risen up to get gain? Probably people with pride in their heart.</p>

<p>My church has four class doors with a middle space between another set of glass doors. As I parked in the lot and walked to the door I couldn’t help but think of Peter running to the tomb to see what has happened.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 25 - We Talk of Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-25-talk-of-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>There is one purpose of a law: to prevent something. Or to ensure something happens. But you really can’t prevent bad things from happening by creating a law because laws are just rules. They define what’s bad.</p>
<p>Consider the law of Moses. It defined what was bad. The Ten Commandments. The ordinances. The many rituals and performances.</p>
<p>But the law was dead.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-25.24">2 Nephi 25.24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the <strong>law hath become dead</strong> unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments. 26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-25.25-26">2 Nephi 25.25–26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forgetting even the spirit of the law, we can just focus on Christ. Just men need no law. # Meaning</p>
<p>The goal of following Christ isn’t to follow him. It’s to become like him. To experience what He experienced. To feel what He felt. The law is dead once you know that and pursue that.</p>

  <title>My Testimony 2023-03-03</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2024-03-03-my-testimony.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It’s the first Sunday of the month, and it’s tradition in the church to publicly bear one’s witness of Christ should they feel inclined. I’ll do that here today…</p>
<section id="the-myth-of-a-messiah" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>The Myth of a Messiah</h1>
<p>I just watched the movie Dune, part 2 last night. Having been slightly captivated by the story, I first watched the Dune Part 1 movie in November and then proceeded to read <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune-messiah.html">Dune: Messiah</a> before just seeing Part 2. <a href="../concepts/frank-herbert.html">Frank Herbert</a>’s main ethos in all the interviews he does is to show the horrors that arise when man puts his faith in <em>heroes</em>. He cites Hitler, Roosevelt, Kennedy, and others that seem mythic from human comparison and they’re only mythic because we made them so. That’s the problem. We made them mythic, he might argue.</p>
<p>Frequently, Paul Atreides says things like “these are my followers, but they used to be my friends.” In one moment he asks himself “have I lost you too, Gurney?”, who is his right hand man. He watched himself go from a 15 year old boy to a worshipped messiah. Paul keeps saying “they only see what they were told to see.”</p>
<p>Separately, I recently read <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a>, which explains Tolkien and CS Lewis’s relationship, and how one of the turning points for Lewis in his atheist-to-Christian conversion was the argument over myth.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-the-myth-of-christ.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The myth of Christ</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Lewis chides Christ as just a myth - something people wanted him to be. A story as old as time.</p>
<p>Tolkien’s viewpoint is of the effect “and why is that a problem?” He posits along the lines that myth is to creation as mathematical theory is to discovering theorems and proofs. It’s the imaginative, creative process to discovering truth. So while Lewis calls Christ a Pagan myth, Tolkien responds as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now the story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God’s myth where the others are men’s myths: i.e.&nbsp;the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call ‘real things’. <a href="https://inspirationdaybook.wordpress.com/2018/06/11/j-r-r-tolkien-c-s-lewis-and-the-idea-of-the-true-myth/">J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and the Idea of the “True Myth” | Russell’s Inspiration Daybook</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s the relationship here?</p>
<p>I’ve often heard Lewis’ argument in my life - “why believe in Christ? it’s just a story that’s been told throughout the centuries.” Dune is one latest example of this, but for millenia there’s been a prophecy of some savior of sorts. It’s all just hogwash.</p>
<p>In Dune, there’s a prophesied messiah of the people. But he’s not deity - he’s the product of selective breeding, excellent combat training, and psychoactive enhancement through drugs. And Paul’s story is also just a story invented by an author. But reflects so many similarities of religious archetypes we hear. Herbert was likely not religious, or perhaps anti-religious, but i can’t find a direct quote.</p>
<p>The point is, where Tolkien espouses the virtues of a savior via Gandalf showing up in the Third Day on the east, and Herbert creating a powerful mortal messiah, we are left to wonder: who is this Christ whom we’ve never met?</p>
<p>Is he an invented story - one I want to desperately believe? A myth concocted to control the masses? # Stories that Lead to Christ</p>
<p>I’m going to diverge for a second and then come back to this point above.</p>
<p>Assume I have an eternal truth to teach you: 1+1=2. Let’s unpack the fact that we have this so deeply memorized that we forget how profound a concept it really is.</p>
<p>Assume I didn’t have numbers to teach you this truth. All I had was leaves from the backyard. One leaf and another leaf is…two leaves? And one blade of grass and another blade of grass is two grass(es)?…nvm. Two blades of grass?</p>
<p>Now imagine I’m a caveman - how do I recognize this story of “1+1=2” without inventing first the concept of “one” and “two”? Can you invent “two” without first inventing “one”? No!</p>
<p>So the caveman first must realize there’s this thing called “one”. Or maybe the caveman called one “oof” and two “doof”, but it’s the same thing. Take some <em>oofs</em> and you get a <em>doof</em>.</p>
<p>Get where I’m going?</p>
<p>The same story said in other languages is still the same story.</p>
<p>Meaning, Christ’s myth told in Tolkien’s fantasy or Herbert’s possibly pseudo heresy can tell the same story.</p>
<p>Let’s unpack some more.</p>
<p>What if that story is not just 1+1=2 but “999+345=1344”. Or the story is “999+344=1345” or “998+347=1343”.</p>
<p>Same concept: two numbers added together to equal a third.</p>
<p>Did you check my math above though?Which statement above is “true”? They’re all just stories. All three of them <em>look</em> correct. But if you check my math, you’ll see that one of those additions is a lie.</p>
<p>Only one of them represents valid truth. The other two aren’t added right, so the story of “+” and “=” doesn’t add up.</p>
<p>In other words, the story of Christ’s can be spun in any direction or it can be told in other forms that appear similar. And they do - lots of religion have a belief in chosen people, a final glory for the “righteous”, etc.</p>
<p>So which is true?</p>
</section>
<section id="the-story-of-christ" class="level1">
<h1>The Story of Christ</h1>
<p>There are many moments in Dune that approximate the story of Christ. But there are crucial components that don’t add up. Paul is a fallible human (though not fallible to his followers). Instead, Christ was actually infallible, regardless of whether he was believed in or not.</p>
<p>He <em>was</em> and <em>is</em> the chosen Messiah. Chosen by Heavenly Father. Chosen to lead. Chosen to redeem. To save. To suffer. To die. To rise. To return.</p>
<p>But why is <em>His</em> story true?</p>
<p>A few years ago, a friend said “the universe opens doors when you ask for it”. I responded “yea, there’s a scripture ‘ask and ye shall receive’”. He responded “that’s great we both come to the same truth but with different belief systems”. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Though I agree that we both got to the same destination and piece of wisdom, my perspective requires in my mind Christ to either have existed or not. Either he was the messiah or not.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-do-i-believe-in-the-messiah" class="level1">
<h1>Why do I believe in the Messiah?</h1>
<p><em>I have a deep and abiding respect for the beliefs of others. I’m merely stating my own, and wish all the privilege of worshipping how, where, or what they may. In that spirit, I want to share my belief.</em></p>
<p>Frankly (pun intended), it doesn’t matter what Tolkien says or what Herbert says. Doesn’t matter what CS Lewis says. These guys were all just humans - like you and me. And none of them can prove or disprove the existence of Christ.</p>
<p>I believe in logic - it’s a form of learning truth. One plus one <em>is</em> two, by definition. Meaning, one plus one is two because that’s how we defined it to be. We have that concept a name.</p>
<p>Also by definition Christ either existed or didn’t exist - regardless of the world’s opinions about His philosophy and theology. It’s simply illogical that He could be both my Messiah but not someone else’s, because someone can choose to believe the earth is flat but it can’t be flat for someone and round for another.</p>
<p>So why am I convinced Jesus Christ is the Messiah of the world He created, the Prince of Peace, the Good Shepherd, the Mediator and Redeemer? Why do I know Him to be real and not just myth?</p>
<p>I can’t describe in words what I feel and know to be true. But I know He lives the same I know one plus one is two.</p>
<p>I’ve read His words in the Bible and <a href="../concepts/the-book-of-mormon-another-testament-of-jesus-christ.html">The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ</a>. I’ve pondered His teachings. And while some say they present a good social contract, they’re more than that. They bring joy because there <em>is</em> light. Treating others with kindness and dignity is more than just a good feeling. It is truth.</p>
<p>Choosing to love one another instead of finding fault isn’t just what a Philosopher taught 32 AD. It’s truth.</p>
<p>Even more than these things though - the reality of Christ isn’t just the presence of good feelings according to following a good teaching, I testify He’s a worker of miracles.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe not only in the good teachings of Christ, but the Living involvement of Him in my life. And this is where I’ll be sparse in my speech, but I’ll recount that miracles have happened in my life in ways only explainable by the existence of a God. Things like praying for guidance and a friend calls me thirty minutes later saying “I don’t know why I felt to call you…” Or, praying for power over the obstacles I face in my life and as I turn to God in prayer a door opens suddenly.</p>
<p>There have been enough of these events that I can only testify He lives. And it’s not just <a href="../concepts/confirmation-bias.html">confirmation bias</a> or a set of coincidences. Because people have seen Him. Have been ministered to by Him. They wrote His teachings. They prophesied of His arrival and the manner of His arrival, and so He did arrive. And what more, they were wrong about what he came to do - he didn’t come to free them from the Romans. He came to free them from themselves.</p>
<p>How else can you know truth other than to be guided to it, and experience it yourself as promised you’d experience it?</p>
<p>He loves all of us. And He is seeking all of our happiness by showing us the way to truth. I believe he loves all religions, even those who don’t believe in Him, because he practices what He preached: love thy neighbor. And I also believe He is the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for a Lord who teaches us all. I’m grateful for His truth taught in stories all around the world in different forms. It’s not evidence of some irrelevant myth. It’s the myth surrounding the incomprehensible truth that He did come, and He did rise on the third day, and He did prepare the way for all of us to live with Him again after this life.</p>

<p>Christ’s final moments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Betrayal. Judas chose to forsake his Savior for money. Jesus knew this would happen, but he also went into the garden to atone for the bitterest sin of all: knowing who the Savior is and turning altogether away from him. Christ must have felt true sorrow for a lost brother that day.</li>
<li>Loneliness. Where were his disciples while he suffered in the garden? They couldn’t stay awake.</li>
<li>Incredible emotional and spiritual pain - paying the debts of the world across time and space. Of all galaxies.</li>
<li>Disbelief of his followers. In his final moments with the Savior, Peter defied the will of the Lord, chose violence, and cut off the ear of a soldier.</li>
<li>Noose. He was walked like a lamb with a noose around his neck.</li>
<li>Crown of thorns.</li>

<p>Each bite slowly decomposes the bread. Each attack on the Savior slowly decomposed his body, spirit, and mind to the point He felt forsaken by His Father. But he kept doing the will of the Father even as He felt forsaken. He showed the Way.</p>

<p>The Lord seeks to offer individualized guidance, the way that He provides guidance for the group. Fire to light the way, smoke to shield you from the past.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 13 - Enduring Beauty</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-13-enduring-beauty.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>While this scripture is sad, it tells some important truths:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon; 19 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers; 20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings; 21 The rings, and nose jewels; 22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins; 23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils. 24 And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty. 25 Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-13.18-25">2 Nephi 13.18–25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lists out all the things we think are so important, but really at the end of the day are meaningless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our dress</li>
<li>our decorations and fine things</li>
<li>Our hair</li>
<li>Our beauty # Meaning</li>
</ul>
<p>Beauty is a closeness with the Lord. Adhering to His gospel.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet! 16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace! 17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever! 18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people; <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-15.15-18">Mosiah 15.15–18</a></p>

  <title>2 Nephi 11 - Seeing My Redeemer</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-11-seeing-my-redeemer.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Nephi explains why he writes the words of Isaiah in his record:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for <strong>he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him</strong>. And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-11.2-3">2 Nephi 11.2–3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, he read the words and enjoyed reading them. Second, he identified with Isaiah - he felt a common bond with him, namely that they had both seen the Redeemer. Third, He wants to establish a testimony to his posterity by saying “Isaiah saw it, but Jacob and I did too. And there will be others as well.”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-jesus-at-the-temple-newborn.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Seeing the Savior"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Can I say I’ve seen my Redeemer?</p>
<p>Nephi wasn’t Moses. He wasn’t the son of Moses. He was the son of a dad who was called to preach to people. There were many prophets like Lehi, per 1 Nephi 1. But Lehi was chosen to leave. Nephi was diligent in His duties.</p>
<p>Seeing the Redeemer is a spiritual event. Moroni was visited by the Lord, “And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus.” (<a href="../scriptures/mormon-1.15">Mormon 1.15</a>)</p>
<p>If we recall, many were visited by Jesus and saw him with their physical eyes and didn’t recognize Him (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-16.15-17.html">Matthew 16.15-17</a>).</p>
<p>Then there was King Lamoni who also experienced a spiritual witness of the Lord: “For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have <strong>seen my Redeemer</strong>; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name.” (<a href="../scriptures/alma-19.13">Alma 19.13</a>) Was King Lamoni a prophet? No.&nbsp;A week before this spiritual experience he was sentencing his servants to death for not taking good enough care of his flocks.</p>
<p>I’m not sure there is a pre-requisite to “seeing” the Lord. I’m also not sure that seeing him with your literal eyes is important at all. But gaining a witness from the Holy Ghost that Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Chosen One on whom we rely on for forgiveness…this is what matters. If ye seek, ye shall find.</p>

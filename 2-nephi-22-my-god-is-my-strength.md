# Scriptures

Where do I put my strength?

> Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also has become my salvation.
> [2 Nephi 22.2](../scriptures/2-nephi-22.2)

If I go to lift a log, I do it because I believe I can and because I have arms and legs. I'm relying on my strength. 

If I believe I can write some code, I do likewise. 

This is how I rely on my strength. And if I don't ask anyone for help, I'm really relying on my strength. 
# Meaning

How can I trust in God while also doing everything I can? Let God prevail.

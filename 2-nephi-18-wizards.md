# Scriptures

People want to look at all sorts for guidance in their life:

> And when they shall say unto you: Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and mutterâ€”should not a people seek unto their God for the living to hear from the dead?
> [2 Nephi 18.19](../scriptures/2-nephi-18.19)

People want to know their future. They want a reading of the tea leaves. The want to know the stories of the ancients, and want to seek out the peeping wizards or whatever to find it. 
# Meaning

As a human, I'm capable of being sucked into the ways of distraction. But it's God that would have us look to Him.

In my deli this morning ([I'm Grateful for Sandwich Shops](sandwich-shops.md)), there's a cheesy quote on the pinboard:

> Maturity is not when we start speaking big things. It is when we start appreciating the small things...

This is why I've started to give thanks daily. It's a powerful rewiring of the brain. 

> And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.
> [Alma 37.7](../scriptures/alma-37.7)

Effects so far of giving thanks daily:

- I think about what I gave thanks on later in the day
- While writing, ideas flood into the mind, building the thoughts more than initially realized 
- When 

I learned once on [my mission](../posts/my-mission.md) that "when I don't have gratitude, I don't have anything." I remember the day I learned this, discussing the concept with my roommate/companion. Those who don't give thanks end up complaining. If you're complaining then you don't have anything you want. If you give thanks, you have everything you could want. The list is endless

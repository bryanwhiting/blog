I first heard about zoom many years ago on a random podcast. Had no idea what it was or why it was useful. Now it's enabled me to work remotely, chat with friends across the nation, and even attend church during lockdowns. 

Behind this is a person with an idea that changed the world. Surely they weren't the first video service, but they build off the earlier, crappier products. 

I'm grateful for V1's like Skype that paved the way for Zoom, which learned a ton, probably poached some talent, and gave me something with using.

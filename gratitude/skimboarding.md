Skimboarding is one of those oddly satisfying sports that isn't exactly thrilling but just delightful enough that you can't get enough. It's like popcorn. Always delicious, but you want just one more. 

The perfect setting is a beach with a long shore, so the tide comes in and slowly ripples out. This is when you can really glide.

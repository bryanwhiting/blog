I sit down for lunch with a friend. The seat is leather. The booth is warm. The table is glossy with that restaurant-style gloss. And the paper in front of me invites me into a world of tasteful possibilities. The most appealing one is that of the chicken biscuit slider. 

Moments later a plate of sliders appears next to a side of truffle fries. The aioli sauce invites a potato's partnership. The crispy crunch of the fried chicken echos within the cavern of my bite. Eyes close. Satisfaction is earned.

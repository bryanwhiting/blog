Tech done right makes me happy. It's also really hard to do because "right" is subjective. But an app designed with principles of simplicity, good colors and fonts, and hidden layers is always a good start. 

Canopy Money has so many things I've wanted in Mint or tried to do myself with my financial system. It's been a delight to see everything in one place. And things like connecting to Amazon to sync Amazon orders with credit card transactions is next level.

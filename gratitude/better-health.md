Having the flu stinks. I realized quickly this week how a life revolves around health. My ability to do my job, to be there for my family, and even enjoy sitting on the couch is all impacted by what's going on inside my body. 

The interesting thing is: when I'm sick, I only want to get better and I realize what's most important. But as I get better, my mind focuses in equal proportion on the normal preoccupations of life and I perhaps focus less on the things I had just realized were most important. 

I'm grateful for good health.

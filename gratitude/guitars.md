Tonight I saw an international guitar concert, with four musicians from Italy, Australia, Brazil, and Vietnam. It's incredible how each adapted the guitar to their own styles. One instrument, so much possibility. 

I learned to play the guitar in college. It was the first time I felt like I understood what it meant to speak another language, despite having learned Spanish. Being able to communicate using an instrument was a powerful experience.

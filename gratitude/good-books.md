I'm grateful for good books. They take time. They take effort. They're art ([I'm grateful for artists](grateful-for-artists.md)). I'm finishing [Dune](../book-review/dune.md) right now and I can't imagine how long and how arduous the task must have been. They say it took Herbert six years, but many years in addition thinking about it. It's powerfully creative, and has set the tone for science fiction for the next 60 years. 

I'm grateful people can be so powerfully curious, intelligent, motivated, and capable to create such a book. Humans can do incredible things.

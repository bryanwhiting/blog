Is there anything truly unique about any one individual? At the very least, any two people probably have eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose. They probably have brain and a heart. Probably have fingers and toes. 

Probably have feelings. Experience love. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Resentment. Joy. Elation. Fear. Anxiety. Doubt. Faith. Fulfillment. Hope. 

The reason why they feel these things will certainly be unique to them, but likely follow the themes of family, friends, food, shelter, fulfillment, etc. 

I learned after being in Honduras for 6 weeks just how different I was from people across the world. 

6 months later I learned (over time) just how deeply similar they are. 

After 2 years I came home and deeply missed Honduras. I felt alone and lost in this American world. 

Now I'm somewhere in between. But the point is: I'm grateful that humans can connect at a deeply human level no matter who they are or where they're from.

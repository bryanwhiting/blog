In walks a scrawny 15 year old kid. Low confidence. Can't ask the girl out he's had a crush on for a year. Can't give himself permission to have the hope of asking her out. 

He walks in reluctantly, he's just a sophomore. The words "life coach" are projected onto a screen. The coach looks over the audience and welcomes the hesitant latecomer. 

Almost two decades later, the coach is the one he calls. The coach is still coaching. The student still has much to learn.

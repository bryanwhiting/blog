Ode to the laundry machine. That tumbling beast. That water container with a motor. That rigid ridged dirt ridder. 

I've lived without you at one point. I washed my clothes on a concrete slab for two years. I bloodied my knuckles on the slab, scraping back and forth. 

By comparison, tossing clothing in, moving it from a wetting box to drying box, etc. doesn't seem all that bad. It's actually quite wonderful.

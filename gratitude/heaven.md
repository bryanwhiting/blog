I'm not sure what I would do if I didn't have a concept of Heaven in my mind. It yields so very many benefits for me:

- Gives me hope for when family members pass
- Reminds me why life matters: I can only take with me my relationships. 
- Heaven is about people, not money. Reminds me what matters *in* life and what will bring me happiness. 
- Gives me purpose as I raise my family. 

I have a sense that heaven is more like a peaceful home than a luxurious resort. Physical amenities don't yield joy. True pleasure and enduring happiness in life come from inner peace.

As a concept alone, it guides you to make better decisions by living long term: death is only a door to the beyond. Even if I assume that heaven is a farce, still believing in it yields so much good for one's life. But thankfully it's not just some notion. It's a real place. I'm grateful the Lord created the heavens. 

> Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.
> [Mosiah 4.9](../scriptures/mosiah-4.9)

![Green hills, little pond](../img/photo-cow-pond.jpeg){.preview-image}

Restlessness settles in his heart. He checks the forecast and it's supposed to be raining, but it's not. He checks again, and suddenly he has a 30 min window. After a morning working through personal finances and resetting 15 passwords, getting hit by a truck sounds like a better idea than sitting in the house for the next five hours. 

"We're going. Who's comin?!" The ladies decline. Someone's gotta be home for certain reasons. And some are just disinterested...or asleep. Okay, so it's a boys trip. They go. 

The wind continually reminded them they are nothing in this vast expanse. The movement of air from unknown regions into their hair and across the grass reminded them they are a part of something much greater. The shimmering hills remind him that he is more nature than he remembers to admit. That he doesn't belong in front of a screen. That this is his home. His heart settles.

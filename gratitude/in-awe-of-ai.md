Today I'm grateful to be in awe of AI. 

I went to makersuite.google.com and fed Gemini 1.5 a 115 page pdf investor report and it retuned a summary with core elements with page references. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ú® Today, we&#39;re making Gemini 1.5 Pro available via the Gemini API in a public preview, along with native audio (speech) understanding. And we&#39;re also addressing many developer asks.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuildWithGemini?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BuildWithGemini</a> ‚Üí <a href="https://t.co/l3OHZAElwX">https://t.co/l3OHZAElwX</a> <br><br>See what&#39;s being launched üßµ‚¨áÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/MMvF8KvITL">pic.twitter.com/MMvF8KvITL</a></p>&mdash; Google for Developers (@googledevs) <a href="https://twitter.com/googledevs/status/1777732045319573812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It's pretty incredible. I'm just in awe and slightly terrified but incredibly excited nonetheless to see what AI can do. [The Coming Wave](../book-review/the-coming-wave.md) is worth the read. And a systemic shift in how everyone does work is coming, per [Power and Prediction](../book-review/power-and-prediction.md).

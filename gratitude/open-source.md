Open source software is incredible. I'm deeply grateful for the people who create it and share it. 

So much of the world benefits from open source software. YouTube was built off Python. Samsung phones run on Android. Most modern websites are built off something Zuckerberg released. PyTorch and Tensorflow have ushered in the AI revolution. 

We'd get along without open source. But we'd be using SAS or Stata, beholden to Oracle and Java everywhere and just enduring a slow pace of innovation. 

AI is open sourced. The future is now.

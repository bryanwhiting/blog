Home Depot gives out little assembly kits for kids on the first Saturday of every month. A few screws. A few pieces of wood. A simple design. 

The chatter between children increases the closer they get to the supplier: a Home Depot working handing out presents to eager children. 

Impatience grows the closer to the bag's opening they become. They see other kids nearly finished around them. They can't wait. 

And so repeat the experience every  first Saturday of every new month.

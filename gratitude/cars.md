When's the last time I walked 40 miles? 30? 20? 10?

It's been a minute. Only 150 years ago or 200 years ago I may have done one of those maybe once a month or year. 

While I'm not entirely sure it's beneficial for my health *not* to walk a ton every day, I'm grateful for cars. 

- I can live far from my workplace. 
- I can visit my parents in a day, today if I wanted
- I can go to the hills, take a hike, and be back to take my kids to school
- I can go get groceries. 

Maybe life was simpler back in the days without cars, I'm not sure. But I'm grateful for the variety of life I can live *with* a car. I also remember not having easy access to a car while living in the city and I just felt so trapped all the time. Cars are great.

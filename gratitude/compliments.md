I'm grateful for compliments. The ones I receive and the ones I can give. 

The cheapest thing you can give someone is a compliment. Yet it may be the most valuable gift to be given. 

I'm reading [Influence The Psychology of Persuasion](../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.md) which talks about "reciprocity". People feel someone obligated to help you when you give them something, even if it's nominal. Isn't a compliment a gift?

[How to Win Friends and Influence People](../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.md) also discusses the benefits of being kind, and putting yourself in another's shoes. Kindness far exceeds the benefits of criticism. A compliment is a way to think about what that person may want to hear and to give them that. Not in an insincere way, but in a sincere way. 

People act how they want to be treated. If they show up to play basketball they want to be told they're good at basketball. If they work on a task for you, it's because they want to be told they're good at that task. It doesn't hurt to be nice. To give a compliment. So give away. 

Being human is recognizing what other people aspire for and recognize that goodness in them. So notice. Notice what they're after. Then give. Give freely, for so did He ([Bread given freely, like His life](../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.md)).

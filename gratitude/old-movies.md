I watched [Casablanca (film) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)) last night for the first time in 10 years. The writing. The angles. The one liners. The implementation of [The Iceberg Theory - Theory of Omission](../posts/the-iceberg-theory-theory-of-omission.md). There are so many cool things.

Great writing is timeless. What connects us to stories are the people that wrote them. The people in them. The Iliad is thousands of years old or whatever. Same with the Bible. They're both written in language that doesn't match modern times. But they're still beautiful because of what they represent.

I've been going to the beach for four years and have never gotten deep into the water. It's frigid. I'll skimboard along the surface or the little crash but never felt a need to go into the water. Besides, it's freezing. 

That's not to say I wouldn't want to if it's warm - I love to body surf and boogie. 

Recently I went back to the beach but with a wet suit in hand. Suddenly everything was better. The [Skimboarding](skimboarding.md) was better because I wasn't afraid of falling and getting a rash, or I wasn't afraid of being cold. I could take the waves head on. And then I just went right out into the water and had the best boogie of my life on a solid wave. 

It was incredible. I mourned that I've wasted 4 years.

Probably and odd thing to be thankful for, but I'm grateful for this guy's legacy. Having read [The Inklings](../book-review/the-inklings.md) and [The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle](../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.md) I decided to read [Mere Christianity](../book-review/mere-christianity.md).

I've read a few things by Lewis and have enjoyed his writing. It's also fun to better imagine him writing it when he was at Oxford in 1940's. 

His writing continues to influence millions. I'm grateful he chose to write what he did even though people around him didn't want him to.

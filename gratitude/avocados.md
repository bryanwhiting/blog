"Aguacate, verduras!" It's a common refrain you hear on the streets of [Honduras](../concepts/Honduras.md). 

I first remember being woken up by this loud bark as a vendor walked the street inviting the entire town to enjoy his "avocados, vegetables!!" 

I don't blame him. I, too, want people to enjoy the things I like. And if this guy was selling avocados then I wanted to be buying. 

It's rare that I don't want avocados on anything. Tonight, I enjoyed them on a hot dog, a classic dish called a "completo" in Chile. Put it on a burger. Put it on a hot dog. It's like green eggs and ham, I'd eat it on a train, with a fox in a box. Here, there, anywhere.

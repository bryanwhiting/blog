The first thing I saw was 10 kids piling onto a loose ball. It was exactly the chaos I'd hope for. 

I look around. I see beautiful green hills. I see parents cheering on their kids. I see kids having fun. 

I'm not really sure other things could make me happier than being in a beautiful place with the people I love.

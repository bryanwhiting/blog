My daughter brought home a book that introduced something I had never before heard about: Navajo code talkers. 

Since the Navajo language had never been written down, it wasn't able to be translated by the Japanese in WWII. And so, the Navajo would encode English words and transmit their words across the radio to talk about positions and bombs and such. It helped them win the war. 

They chose to serve a country they were being heavily persecuted in ([Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI](../book-review/killers-of-the-flower-moon.md)). It's incredible to think about. 

I'm grateful for them and all like them that helped provide the freedoms I enjoy.

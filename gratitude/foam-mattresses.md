Bed in a box. It's all the rage. 

It shows up on your porch. You lug it upstairs, cut it open, unravel it and poof: you have a bed. 

The first time we got a foam mattress was in 2017. It changed our life. 

Anytime I travel I always wish I was home. Nothing like a long nights sleep in a reasonably priced, highly comfortable, never sagging, bed in a box mattress.

This is a fairy house:

It took us hours to build, and I'm not sure where the idea came from, but we each took time building something for the house. There's an A frame, a Bon fire, a ladder, a circle swing. And most importantly: a door to the fire pit. 

My wife commented, "I kinda wanna go out and play out there."

It's magical. It was a special time to work on this memory with our kids. I'm grateful for these moments that parenting provides. I don't know when else it'd be so exciting to hit glue some sticks together. But it was.

Have you ever pulled out a board game when you're in a rush?

No! You pull it out when times are good. When you've got time to play. Time to relax. Time to spend with loved ones. 

I have memories playing Monopoly with my siblings, or Settlers with my high school friends, or Ticket to Ride more recently. 

Games bring people together. I'm grateful for the people who make the games, for the people who create a market for them, and for the friends I can play with.

Tonight there was a moment in my day where I wanted to change my perspective. For me, prayer is a helpful tool in changing my perspective. I believe God helps those who seek His help. 

And I had a crazy experience with food poisoning a few days ago that, because I said a prayer, helped me turn it into something good. 

Perhaps this can be a recurring prayer: make this challenge be for my benefit. 

I'm grateful God loves His children and answers prayers.

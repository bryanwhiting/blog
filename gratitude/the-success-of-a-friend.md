Today I felt genuinely happy for one of my friends who had gotten some good news today. They sent me a text and I sent my wife a text and smiles happened all around. It was the cause of a lot of dancing and happiness. 

While reading [The Happiest Man on Earth](../book-review/the-happiest-man-on-earth.md), the theme of relationships shines through as the thing that makes us happiest. I wouldn't be who I am without a strong wife and my best friends. Perhaps in some part I've rubbed off on them.

Just watched the movie Dune again for the second time in four months. I'm excited for Dune 2 this weekend. And I've also read [Dune](../book-review/dune.md) and [Dune: Messiah](../book-review/dune-messiah.md)...yea it's been a Dune four months. 

Dune got me back into fiction. I enjoy Herbert's style of writing. Very smart, very thoughtful. You can tell he really thinks through a lot of things that he barely mentions in the book. I think this gives the book a certain richness - less is more. But when creating universes, those details provide a colorful backdrop. 

I'm impressed by how good the movie is, and how true it is to the book. It's rare to have a movie so close to the book. 

It's just fun to read.

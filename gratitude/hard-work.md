My dad grew up on a sheep farm. And his dad grew up farming too. Same with his dad, all the way back to when dads were a thing. 

One of my grand/great grands worked on a beet farm. I read a story once about the beet farmers by Jay Jensen. It was called "Hoe to the end of the row" (apparently there's a poem with that same title).

![Beet it, just beet it...](../img/dalle-beat-farming.jpeg){.preview-image}

The principle the author shared was of planting to the end of the row. Some people got lazy and gave up 80% of the way through. But the hard workers went to the end. They took pride in it. And when the harvest came the boss knew who was coming back next summer: those with finished rows. 

I'm grateful for hard work. My grandpa told my dad to work with his mind, not his back. 
So my dad got a desk job. And so did I. 

Perhaps if my grandpa had seen today maybe he would instead say "get off those screens and go plant a beet". But hard work is hard regardless of it being mental or physical. "Hard work" is the reward itself. 

In another quote my father shared with me: "the gift of a good life is having lived it". Same applies to hard work. The reward of hard work is having done it. 

Most of what we do on a daily basis goes unnoticed. The rewards are for ourselves. This is a joy of life.

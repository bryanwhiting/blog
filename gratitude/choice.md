Choice is a concept. It's a gift. It's a freedom we all have to some, if not every, degree. 

The simplest choice is to wake up. From there, it's about what to eat. Drink. Where to walk. Move. Talk. 

And that's really all a day is - talking, walking, drinking, eating...all while being awake. 

This is life. This is the power of choice.

Life is kind of like going down a river. Can't choose the rocks, but you can choose how to navigate them.

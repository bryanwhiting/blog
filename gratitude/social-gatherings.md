This week I went to a tiny venue concert. The person who invited me said, "Can you believe that just two years ago we were forbidden to gather like this?"

We were listening to a Honky Tonk/Rockability Banjo jammer who just absolutely slayed the whole night. The energy was off the charts. Everyone was dancing and having a great time. 

I'm glad and grateful we can get together again.

I'm grateful for rest. Time away. I'm grateful that by taking time away, my brain resets. Now I'm more energized to tackle the day. 

Why is rest necessary? I don't know. But it is. Bodies need sleep. Minds need breaks. 

I find that the mind is easier to overrule than a tired body. Why? Why can we push our brains more than is healthy for them? It's hard to answer, but only rest tells us where our mind can be.

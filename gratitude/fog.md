Fog is poetic. You can be stuck in it. Or you can rise above it.

Once you get above the fog, it ceases to blind you and instead becomes something quite beautiful to behold. 

That's kind of like life. Problems can overwhelm and blind us, but looking back we're glad at the beauty they've created in our life.

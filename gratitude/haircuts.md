Growing up my mom would cut my hair. I would sit in the bathroom on a wooden stool, looking into the mirror. 

Today I cut my son's hair for the first time. I couldn't help but think of those many years of one-on-one conversations with my mom. 

Spending time just sitting and talking can be the best time we have to share. It can be something as simple as a boring haircut.

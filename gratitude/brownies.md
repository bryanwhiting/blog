I walk downstairs, the kitchen is clean. It's 7:47 and I know at 8 it's too late. Now is the time.

My wife opens the pantry, pulls out the bowls, mixes some ingredients, and I power wash some dishes. "Will you put this in the oven when it's ready?" I wait for the beep. It beeps. I plop in the tray, it's 8:01. 

45 minutes later the tray emerges, having fulfilled its purpose. With a clatter on the table, warmth released from the oven and into the kitchen as the pan rested on the stove. Vanilla ice cream emerged from the freezer. Smiles ensued.

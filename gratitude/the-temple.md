Tonight I went to the temple. 

Inside every temple is a feeling of calm and peace. The people inside are all there to focus and learn about the Savior, which invokes a quiet reverence for the duration of the visit. 

Today I came away reminded of the power of prayer. I'm grateful for the temple and the peace I feel inside.

I've been the recipient of a lot of kindness in my life. I know anyone reading this has too. Kindness is a wonderful gift to give someone. It doesn't cost anything to be kind. 

Ways people have been kind to me:

- Someone called me when they knew I was making a big decision to listen to me.
- Parents who showed me how to be kind to each other.
- A friend who complemented me.
- My wife who goes on dates with me and hangs out with me. 
- A child who wants to give dad a hug.

Kindness does need to be *received*, I've learned. Kindness can be received when things are going well, as well as when life is tricky, though kindness is probably most poignantly felt and appreciated during hard times. I think that's a gift: to receive kindness. It's also a gift to give. Who do you know that could use some kindness today?

!["Kindness. Watercolors. Expressionist." Seems like kindness takes the form of an angel per Dalle. I think that's appropriate.](../img/dalle-image-kindness-watercolors-expressionist.jpeg){.preview-image}

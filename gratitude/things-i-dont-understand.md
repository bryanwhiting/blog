I don't know about or understand a lot of things. Here's a random list:

- molecular biology
- brain surgery
- Shakespeare
- Diplomacy between nations
- Best teaching methods for four year olds 
- How the heater in my house works
- How Apple Silicon works
- A lot of data science stuff despite working as a data scientist for 10 years

The thing with knowledge is that the more you get of it, the more questions you have about the world. It was kind of hard even making that list above because I know enough to know that I don't know enough about it. What about all the things I know nothing about. Or scarier, what about the things I think I know something about but really don't. 

All these things mean there's something to be learned on every day, every minute. The world is full. We are all multi-faceted individuals who can do a ton of different things. Perhaps often we compare ourselves to those who know most about a subject vs the value and opportunity we bring with the unique set of knowledge each of us has accumulated. 

I'm grateful I'm usually wrong. It means there's a better way. And if things turned out okay *and* I'm wrong, that's even better: it means I can improve!

I'm grateful I'm able to learn from anyone on earth, who at least has a guaranteed different life experience and set of knowledge gained. I'm also grateful that everyone else is as imperfect as me, which means I can challenge them to figure out how they came to their knowledge and whether their knowledge is actually that or just a belief/opinion/etc. 

All of this is fun, gives diversity to life, lets me know that there's hope for a better world.

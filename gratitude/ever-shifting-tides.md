The tech industry is pretty crazy. I was just watching some keynote talks from Nvidia and if they actually land half of the stuff they're talking about, they're going to just plow the world in a new direction. 

I watch it and probably feel both awe and fear. What will the future look like? And will I do anything that cool? I kind of look at my little bag of talents and wonder how I fit into this big world. 

But I do. I do fit in. I'm a part of that tide of shifting technology, of pushing the boundaries forward. I'm grateful for a job in tech. It isn't easy. But it's rewarding. It's changing people's lives.

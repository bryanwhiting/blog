There are several reasons why I'm grateful for eyes:

1. **They're fun to look at**. Ever look at a newborn's eyes? Your significant other's?
2. **They interpret light.** My ears can't interpret light. My feet can't. But my eyes can. They can perceive depth, color, texture, etc. 
3. **They inspired the creation of the camera,** and we use to our eyes to look at photos of good memories. 

Paraphrasing a quote from [Dune](../book-review/dune.md), "don't rely too much on sight, it dulls your other senses". I wonder what I'd be able to see if I didn't have eye sight. I suppose I could be grateful for that too: that life is still wonderful even without eye sight.

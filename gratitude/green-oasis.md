![The beauty just minutes away](../img/photo-nearby-green-hills.jpeg){.preview-image}

It's hard to fathom how pretty these hills are. I see them every morning as I drive from my house. I see them in the distance. But their full beauty isn't appreciated until my feet climb. 

There's something about being in the valley that causes me to think I know what's up there. I've also been up there many times. 

But the reality is it's just its own thing. I gotta go see it to believe it. And it's really worth believing.

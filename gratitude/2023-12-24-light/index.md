I installed 72 lights today. This took drilling a hole into my fence, then making the cord taught, then screwing the screw into the cord's loopy thingy. Then I move on to the next one. 

The whole process took three hours. But I'm glad it took three hours. I appreciate it so much more because I did it myself. I thought carefully about each hole I drilled. 

And it felt good to sit out there and listen to an audio book (lots of Dune today, some Killers of the Flower Moon). 

I'm grateful for Thomas Edison. For the inspiration he received, for the hard work he did to give the gift of light to the world. And if he hadn't done it someone else would have, which is also something to be grateful for. There are a lot of smart, good people on this earth.

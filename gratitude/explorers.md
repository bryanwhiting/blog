I'm reading [The Wager](../book-review/the-wager.md) right now and am enthralled and saddened by the horrible circumstances people had to go through on boats back in the day. 

Without explorers, we wouldn't have the knowledge of the world that we have now. 

I'm grateful for the freedoms we enjoy now, as most of us don't have to fear about body snatchers coming to take us on a ship and force us to work until we die. 

It's the simple things, I guess...

It's that moment where you stop walking because you walked to the destination you can no longer approximate. 

It's called a peak. 

Human nature loves peaks. They're exclusive. Interestingly, they're probably far more tracked than random grassy spots in your neighborhood park. Because everyone wants to get to the peak. 

I'm grateful I can hike. That I can choose random destinations. And that I can go to them.

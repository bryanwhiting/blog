Mindfulness is a state of mind. But being present with one's body is another matter. 

Reading [Heal Your Nervous System](../book-review/heal-your-nervous-system.md) has been interesting as I've learned about additional senses beyond the five we commonly know. Certainly, meditating has had experiences for me that have been floaty feelings or what not. 

I'm grateful I've had these experiences and know what they are.

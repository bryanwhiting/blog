I grew up with exercise equipment in my house, and like most equipment for most people, I didn't use it. Part of the reason was it was hard to get going. 

There's nothing easier than hopping on an exercise bike. Having been a runner most of my life, when I first got the Peloton I realized how nice it was to get a solid workout in 20 minutes. It's just so easy with the little kilojoule calculator there. 

And it could be any exercise bike, really, but I'm grateful for the one I have.

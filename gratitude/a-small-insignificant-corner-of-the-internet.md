As I'm perusing LinkedIn today, I see comments from past colleagues. It's quite incredible to be able to connect in this way. 

But also incredibly unnatural, from the long-standing view of humanity. 

Humanity has always been about connecting people. Writing letters. Going on walks. Standing in the town square to share your message. 

The internet is now the town square. And humans are manipulating the robots that command our attention. All social media sites optimize for time spent on their platform. More eyeballs. 

That's why it's exhausting and addictive to continue to scroll. 

Today, I'm grateful I don't have to keep scrolling. I have a life to live.

Just played some ball tonight. Not sure who invented this game, but it's really come a long way. 

The cool thing is that you can be horrible at shooting and still find a way to contribute. There are a lot of skills and abilities that make a good team. 

I play with the same 20 guys, and it's amazing how different combinations of 5 people play so differently. The flow, the passing, the defense - it all varies with who've you got on the court. And that's what makes it fun. Sometimes you contribute more. Sometimes less.

I've played it my whole life, though never well. I played in rec leagues in college. In rec leagues in high school. And now with a bunch of folks who just love the game. And that's why it's fun: it brings people together.

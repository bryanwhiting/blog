Growing up I played a lot of sports, namely football and lacrosse. One of the best things about playing lacrosse was that it happened in the spring, as the snow was melting and the town warming. 

When it was cold in the early season, players would lay close to the artificial turf. It was soft, and retained the heat of the sun. It was sometimes the best way to warm up. 

I think of that warmth when I lay in my backyard.

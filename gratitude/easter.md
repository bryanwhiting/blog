I'm grateful for Easter. I'm grateful for the knowledge of a Savior. That He died, and rose from the dead. That He lives. 

A belief in Jesus is a belief in quite a number of wonderful things:

- All people will live eternally. We will all get bodies because of Him. 
- Death is not the end, but just another step in an everlasting life 
- Sickness and pain is only temporary. In the hereafter there are joys untold awaiting us. 
- A God is willing to die for us. We are worth His love. His sacrifice. Each one of us. 
- There is unimaginable power in this universe that we can't imagine even tapping. Who on earth can raise the dead? Not even the most brilliant doctor. But for Christ, it's what He will do. 
- Families and beloved relationships will perpetuate beyond the grave. 
- There is always hope even in the darkest days. Christ was among an oppressed people. He was rejected by those he came to serve. He was crucified. But then he rose from the dead and it was finished. 

There are even many more blessings.

    "text": "Elon Musk pay package from Tesla denied by Delaware judge | AP News\n\n\n\nWages\n\n\nKind of an interesting idea - what if you took the hours he worked to figure out what his hourly rate was. It‚Äôs been 7521 days since July 1, 2003, the day Tesla incorporated. That means his work has been worth 7.312M dollars per day. A quick search shows Tesla‚Äôs revenue was 81Bn in 2022, about 221M per day. So his comp is just 3% of current daily revenue.\nI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing something, like how much he‚Äôs been comped in the past. But 3% for making a company what it is doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable. Of course, that‚Äôs not 3% on last year. That‚Äôs like 67% of 2022 revenue. Indeed that‚Äôs a lot.\nMan, getting paid $7m per day is a lot of money. With $55M (assuming post tax) money he could buy literally every house in my town, at a premium of 50%. Imagine: a town called Elon. Or he could finally afford Twitter üßê.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Don‚Äôt tell me the disease ridden McPlay place with its sad meals isn‚Äôt to blame too.\nAfter reading The Quest for Cosmic Justice I‚Äôve considered how negative regulation can be. Let‚Äôs thought experiment: stop advertising to kids. Well then why not stop advertising to people of any other demographic? Old people are vulnerable too right? Okay so then let‚Äôs have free market. Advertise to anyone - okay let‚Äôs enable smoking ads again for kids. No that‚Äôs not good.\n\n\nYouTube derived the greatest ad revenue from users 12 and under ($959.1 million), followed by Instagram ($801.1 million) and Facebook ($137.2 million). Instagram derived the greatest ad revenue from users ages 13-17 ($4 billion), followed by TikTok ($2 billion) and YouTube ($1.2 billion). The researchers also calculated that Snapchat derived the greatest share of its overall 2022 ad revenue from users under 18 (41 percent), followed by TikTok (35 percent), YouTube (27 percent), and Instagram (16 percent).\n\nOpenAI announces first partnership with a university - education is going to be greatly commoditized. - Academic researchers can enjoy researching again instead of teaching (what some of them are horrid at) - I took an accounting class where half was online, half in person. This will be the future for all classes, but probably 10% in person. - The value of the professor will be in office hours.\nMeta‚Äôs new goal is to build artificial general intelligence - The Verge\n\nWe‚Äôre used to there being pretty intense talent wars,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut there are different dynamics here with multiple companies going for the same profile, [and] a lot of VCs and folks throwing money at different projects, making it easy for people to start different things externally.\n\n\nBig tech has the compute resources to develop AGi\nMultiple AGI competition will increase security, lower cost.\nWe‚Äôll all have access eventually to open source AGI. And the same bad guys that have access will be countered by the good guys who have access. Just like today.\n\nGitHub - FlagOpen/TACO - It‚Äôs good to have benchmarks everyone can rely on. Hopefully they don‚Äôt leak into the training data.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "The Jewish officials, who had not hesitated to slay their Lord, were horrified at the thought of men left hanging on crosses on such a day, for thereby the land would be defiled; so these scrupulous rulers went to Pilate and begged that Jesus and the two malefactors be summarily dispatched by the brutal Roman method of breaking their legs, the shock of which violent treatment had been found to be promptly fatal to the crucified. The governor gave his consent, and the soldiers broke the limbs of the two thieves with cudgels. Jesus, however, was found to be already dead, so they broke not His bones. Christ, the great Passover sacrifice, of whom all altar victims had been but suggestive prototypes, died through violence yet without a bone of His body being broken, as was a prescribed condition of the slain paschal lambs.\n\nSee Chapter 35.

At any moment it could all just go poof.\n\nThere is no in between. It‚Äôs just a game of tennis. This is anxiety. I hope it doesn‚Äôt always have to be like this.\nWhen I take a step back and look at the bigger picture though, this is what my last month has looked like (See below). It‚Äôs good to sit back and look.\nI believe this is going to work out. I do. It will because it‚Äôs not some massive risk. It‚Äôs very small but sized opportunities. Each client is their own. There is no coordinated systemic risk. I‚Äôm not swinging for the fences. I just need a few bunts per month. If bunt 1 misses, it‚Äôs uncorrelated with bunt 2. They‚Äôll fall. People see the value. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going to be a slog, but it‚Äôs also in my mind worth the hustle.\n\nDear team.\nThis week, the following has happened:\n\nseveral audits for new customers (thanks @Adrian, @Sean)\nSet up a few customers on GBP (thanks @Adrian!)\nHad dozens of cold calls that are still waiting for me to call them! 5/5 of the people i‚Äôve talked to are interested. Great work @Guil!\n@Sean joined us. he‚Äôs working on doing some cold calls and helping with some Local SEO audits. Welcome Sean!\nNo new deasl this week, Had several people say they‚Äôll pay next week. one cold call from @Guil , and two of my friends. Once this happens, we‚Äôre no longer losing money! (good for you - means you get more employment for years to come!) A lot of people are busy july 3-5 because of the holiday.\nBuilt out a website http://www.precisionconcretebayarea.com from @Joshua Dumalag. Congrats Josh! A few more finishing touches and the customer will be really happy!\nMade a pitch to a big apartment company. Hoping they close in the coming weeks.\n@Lou Elton Evasco started working with our customer CGRE to help with ads.\n@VeNae Rosdahl built our customer‚Äôs ads in Canva.\nWe launched http://docs.silvermineai.com/services and other websites to share out to customers.\nWe did a ton of behind-the-scenes work like onboarding flow @Mark Jayson Realino. just check asana for all the tasks Mark has put out!\nSpoke with a dental group (2 locations) that wants us. The marketer is sold (wife of the husband dentist), she just needs to check with her team. This could be a ~2k/mo deal!\n\nHousekeeping: - I paid most people as of the time of this post. if you haven‚Äôt been paid, check your DM‚Äôs.\nNext week: - Goal: sign 2 deals out of 3-4 that are hopeful. None are more than 2 weeks old since Guil‚Äôs first cold call, it typically takes 3-4 fweeks to close. @Guil‚Äôs confident that within time a lot of these folks will\nTeam notes: - Thank you for all the work that you‚Äôre doing. As of June 7, none of you existed to me. Now we have 7 paid staff, 6 paying customers ($1515/mo MRR - all friends and family). This was an incredibly wild month. I honestly didn‚Äôt think this was really possible, but here we are. - I think we have our team - we‚Äôre ready to scale to Ads and Social media, and we have plenty of support on Local SEO work. We‚Äôll focus on growing our business for the next month. - I‚Äôm invested in helping each of you grow in your careers. Where there‚Äôs hard work, I recognize it! I‚Äôve already given 2 raises. I see what you put in! I want to support you and your families for years to come. - We‚Äôre all learning together. Thanks for your patience. I apologize if I‚Äôm not immediately responsive to every question. - When in doubt, take some actions and just let me know what you did! I doubt anyone is capable of messing anything up - you‚Äôre all really smart and experienced. I may ask for some revisions, but I don‚Äôt want to slow you down.\nLet‚Äôs go!!\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Meeting booked Monday\nMy Filipino cold caller found someone who at least listened to me. 10% chance of going through is higher than 0%. My Filipino cost me $0 because he‚Äôs on a $300 commission (half of a whole months pay)\nMy own mother in law signed up. I hadn‚Äôt even thought of her.\nI got maybe 2-4 other solid leads from things that could be a great match.\n\n8 hours replying to each person who liked my post. I want to build a community - not just spam people. These 60 likes are my fans. People who like me enough to like it. Or like what I‚Äôm doing.\n$390 in recurring revenue. If Monday drops I‚Äôm at maybe +$225. That‚Äôs $615. My phone center is $220/mo. My callers are free. My virtual assistant to help me is $500/mo. I‚Äôm a few hundred from breakeven. I still don‚Äôt even know how to make a Google business profile, the thing I‚Äôm selling.\nBut I understand what‚Äôs going on, so I can sell. I just haven‚Äôt done it yet.\nBut I‚Äôm gonna learn.\nTakeaways:\n\n10% chance of success &gt; 0% chance. You miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take. To build, put yourself in situations where you start off with a 10% but then get to the point of being able to be at 30% on the 20th try. Most of the time we prefer to be at 0% chance of success than 1%.\nQuickest way to make money, and perhaps the only way, is to ask someone for it and offer them something more valuable to them in return.

I laid out my offer and he just said ‚Äúyea you could do that but that offer doesn‚Äôt really work with agents and it‚Äôs a long sales cycle.‚Äù\nIt just woke me up. I‚Äôve been so on the fence about all of this TBH. It‚Äôs just so not me. I‚Äôm a corporate software guy‚Ä¶.\nSo I then pounded all the local SEO work last week and texted 5 friends. The wife of one of the friends signed up for $150. Then my fam member signed up for $120. Then I posted on Facebook.¬†\nAnother fam member saw my post who I‚Äôd just had dinner with the night before and was like ‚Äúhow did I not know you are doing this?‚Äù They signs up with their little business for $120.\nMy FB post offered $225 as an intro rate. I told my story. 70 people have liked it. I messaged each and every one.¬†\nOne person who liked it, didn‚Äôt know it was legit. She thought my FB account was hacked because I never post on FB. She‚Äôs a friend from 10 years ago. Haven‚Äôt spoken too since college. They‚Äôre a realtor.¬†\nIf they hadn‚Äôt liked and I hadn‚Äôt messaged then to thank me for liking, they never would have known this was a real thing, and perhaps it never would have been a real thing.\nI sent my offer and today they signed up for $600/mo for Local SEO at $225 and local ads at $375/mo on Facebook. If they sell their house, they makes $15k. It‚Äôs a no brainer.¬†\nOnce they gives me their credit card they gives an audible sigh of relief, ‚ÄúBryan I know I just paid you $600 but I feel $6,000 of relief!! Can‚Äôt wait to have your help!

    "title": "Blogging with Quarto, and why I don‚Äôt use Medium anymore",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Been here before, eh?\nI probably shouldn‚Äôt write this post considering I‚Äôve also written posts ‚Äúblogging with Jekyll‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlogdown‚Äù, and ‚Äúdistill‚Äù before. I‚Äôm flaky, what can I say. I‚Äôve changed my blogging framework 7 times in 5 years (I started with blogger.com and Wordpress before Jekyll, and even used Medium for 25 posts.)\nBut it‚Äôs not my fault. There are too many static site generators and it seems that Rstudio is as flaky as me. Meaning, they built rmarkdown, created hugodown, blowdown, bookdown, and distill. Hugodown is a lightweight version of blogdown, and I never figured out why it exists. Then there‚Äôs workflowr and so many other great, random products out there.\nWhy quarto for me? It seems to have all the stuff that distill has, and then some. And given its design and collaboration with Wes McKinney (pandas guy) in building quarto, and given that Wes wrote his latest book with it, I think this will be here to stay for at least 5 years.\n\n\nWhy do I avoid Medium\nWhy don‚Äôt I blog with Medium? I wrote 25 posts there over 9 months and loved it. It makes writing and publishing incredibly easy, which is why I did it. With distill/blogdown the limiting factor was I‚Äôd have to be at my computer to get a post in. I love writing on my phone - I have over 2000 journal entries with Day One over seven years, several of which are ‚Äúdraft‚Äù posts for a blog that won‚Äôt see the light of day since I don‚Äôt care about them after I‚Äôve written it. I want to be able to blog frequently, a short little blurb to keep up my writing, and medium enabled this.\nBut 1) I didn‚Äôt get many views (not that I care) and 2) my writing is stuck on their platform (confirmed to me this week as I‚Äôve tried several old, broken tools that attempt to export posts out of medium).\nI got 50x the views on my blogdown site just from organic google searching. From reading other people‚Äôs posts about leaving Medium, it‚Äôs seems that most traffic to Medium posts comes from outside of Medium.\nSo while I‚Äôm certainly not into blogging for the money, I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting the content to people who it can help. And if medium didn‚Äôt enable this, what is its purpose?\nSo I‚Äôm back and finally decided that I‚Äôm going to own my own platform. Seth Godin wrote a blog about this topic once. Why be on Medium, substack, Facebook, etc or any other up an coming platform? We‚Äôll they‚Äôre all skewed toward the 1% of people who make money on the platform. Everyone else is wasting their time. So might as well own your content. And better to focus on writing than waste time catching up on every platform.\nAlso, it‚Äôs fun! There‚Äôs a fuzzy feeling to blogging.\n\n\nFuture of quarto?\nI‚Äôm speculating here, but Quarto can be used withR Studio, Jupiter or VS Code. The last editor seems excitingly suspicious.\nPerhaps R Studio sees the writing on the wall that VS Code is taking over the IDE world and perhaps taking over the long term future of R Studio IDE. I personally don‚Äôt see why anyone would pay for R Studio when VS Code is free and has a better interface. And while R Studio has a few better integrations for R at the moment, it won‚Äôt once enough people see the light for VS Code and turn their contributions there. I‚Äôve been using R on VSCode for two years now and it rivals R Studio in 95% of the feature set, but 100% has better window management.\nSo Quarto seems like a great opportunity for R Studio to begin monetizing on a publishing platform like R Studio connect. Platforms like Notion and Confluence are great for everyone except data scientists trying to share reproducible research. But a quarto server seems like a great way to finally bring in Python data scientists into the markdown-flavored documentation world. (Man, I personally can‚Äôt use Jupyter/Google colab notebooks when I can use R Markdown!) I‚Äôd heartedly welcome this prospect, though I have no idea what their plans for Quarto really are.\nTill next blog post about what blogging tool I‚Äôm going to use‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Meaning, if you have some data on your customers (what they purchased and when), you would hope that there‚Äôs some rules that your customers are operating under. If you knew their income, their budget, their preferences, etc then you can guess how much they have to spend at a given time. Thus, if you know how much gas is in their tank, the mileage of the vehicle, the MPG of the vehicle, you can predict when they‚Äôll stop to fill up on a road tip. When they fill up, they generate some data. ‚ÄúBob purchased $34.52 of gas on Monday at 5:43pm.‚Äù Why did they purchase at that time of day? And why did they spend exactly $34.52?\nIf all you have outcome/results data then you can‚Äôt ever make predictions. But if you know what type of car Bob drives, how often he drives, how much gas he had in the morning when he left his house, etc, you can start to predict when he‚Äôll next fill up.\nThe assumption behind a model is that what was true in the past will remain true in the future.\nWhy have there been so many issues because of COVID?

    "text": "Link to the 1912 publication, Twas the Night Before Christmas\noriginal poem was 1820‚Äôs\nSt Nick was 4th century\nDutch brought the name ‚ÄúSinterklass‚Äù to the U.S. in the 1600‚Äôs.\nSt Nick becomes red by 1931, thanks to Coke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe OG St.¬†Nick\n\n\nEverything below is produced by GPT:\n‚ÄúHow long has the concept of Santa been around? Where did‚Äùst nick‚Äù come from?‚Äù\n\nThe concept of Santa Claus has evolved over many centuries, originating from the historical figure of Saint Nicholas. Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century Christian bishop in Myra, which is now part of modern-day Turkey. He was known for his generosity and for performing miracles, which earned him a reputation as a protector of children and sailors.\n\n\nThe name ‚ÄúSanta Claus‚Äù evolved from the Dutch ‚ÄúSinterklaas,‚Äù a short form of Sint Nikolaas (Saint Nicholas). Dutch immigrants brought the traditions of Sinterklaas to America in the 17th and 18th centuries. In these traditions, Sinterklaas was depicted as a serious, religious figure who rewarded good children and punished the naughty ones.\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, especially in America, the image of Santa Claus as we know it today began to take shape. The 1823 poem ‚ÄúA Visit from St.¬†Nicholas‚Äù (commonly known as ‚ÄúTwas the Night Before Christmas‚Äù) played a crucial role in shaping the modern character of Santa Claus, including his physical appearance and the tradition of delivering gifts to children.\n\n\nLater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, Santa‚Äôs image was further popularized through various media, including advertisements, films, and songs, which contributed to the jovial, red-suited, and reindeer-driving character recognized globally today. This character represents a blend of the historical Saint Nicholas, folk traditions from various cultures, and modern commercial and media influences.\n\nHow did St Nick become red?\n\nThe transformation of Saint Nicholas into the red-suited Santa Claus is a gradual evolution influenced by cultural, artistic, and commercial factors. The image of Santa Claus wearing red clothes began to become popular in the 19th century, but it was solidified in the 20th century, particularly through advertising.\n\n\n\n19th Century Literature and Art: In the 19th century, Santa Claus was often depicted in various colors of robes, including blue, green, and brown. However, by the latter half of the 19th century, the image of Santa in a red suit began to appear more frequently in literature and illustrations. Thomas Nast, a prominent American cartoonist, played a significant role in popularizing this image. In his illustrations for Harper‚Äôs Weekly starting in the 1860s, Nast depicted Santa Claus in a variety of outfits, including the now-familiar red suit.\n\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Advertising in the 20th Century: The standardized image of Santa Claus in a red suit with white fur trim was popularized and became iconic largely due to Coca-Cola advertising campaigns. In 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to create a Santa Claus for their Christmas advertising campaign. Sundblom‚Äôs Santa was jolly, rotund, and dressed in a red suit with white fur trim, which matched the company‚Äôs color scheme. These advertisements were widely circulated and became immensely popular, cementing the image of Santa Claus in a red suit in the public‚Äôs imagination.\n\n\n\nWhile the red-suited Santa Claus is now ubiquitous, it‚Äôs important to note that the evolution of his image was influenced by a blend of historical, cultural, and commercial factors over several decades.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "Self Surveillance\nI came across this article in Flowing Data and thought it was fascinating.\nI‚Äôve been on a productivity kick lately and notice these apps have habit trackers. I‚Äôve tried using them in the past and have realized it gets too much too quickly. But that doesn‚Äôt mean as a data guy that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a cool idea. It just overwhelms me.\nWe‚Äôll I discovered that me tracking a few habits a day is junior varsity level. Felix‚Äôs blog is how it‚Äôs done to the extreme. Clearly this guy isn‚Äôt worried about Big Tech or Big Government harvesting his personal data. I love the boldness!\nThis is just 1/20th of the full page screen shot:\n\nThe number of slices and views he has is endless. It‚Äôs crazy to see everything he‚Äôs tracking, partly I‚Äôm sure because he has fun with it and the other part because he deep down hopes there‚Äôs something there.\nHis quote on Flowing Data has stuck with me:\n\nOverall, having spent a significant amount of time building this project, scaling it up to the size it‚Äôs at now, as well as analysing the data, the main conclusion is that it is not worth building your own solution, and investing this much time. When I first started building this project 3 years ago, I expected to learn way more surprising and interesting facts. There were some, and it‚Äôs super interesting to look through those graphs, however retrospectively, it did not justify the hundreds of hours I invested in this project.\n\nThis guy probably knows himself in a way that none of us ever will. He can‚Äôt ever lie to himself and say ‚Äúyea, I‚Äôm good at exercising every day‚Äù because he‚Äôs got the data to back it up. But is this the life we want?\n\n\nSelf Surveillance as a Service\nSSaaS? Apparently. Exist.io tries to find patterns in your personal data and tell you when your most happy.\n\n\n\nExist.io\n\n\nWhen I researched the Apple Watch team a few years back I came to appreciate what they were/are trying to do: correlate heart monitoring with insurance claims data to proactively identify preemptive signs of cardiac arrest and other health issues.\nThat seems meaningful in theory because information about other people can be correlated with information about me.\nBut does info about myself correlate with info about myself? Probably. I have cycles. I have common traps and pitfalls like any human walking this earth. Some pitfalls are daily, some are quarterly or seasonal.\nBut I can also take 5 minutes to ponder reflectively or talk to a close friend and identify those patterns. What‚Äôs more human?\nAnd what‚Äôs more: if you end up changing your behavior then your past can‚Äôt really predict your future. So all of the data becomes moot once it achieves its purpose: true lasting change. Because if you truly change your behavior based on the insights you glean about yourself, those past triggers and anomalies no longer affect you in the way they did. So when you experience a personal step change in life, you‚Äôre a new you. Maybe not. But maybe.\nAlso, the new generations growing up on smartphones have a unique challenge: their online identities are given to them before they‚Äôre really conscious enough to determine if that‚Äôs what they want to show the world. Parents posting YouTube or TikToks of their kids are cementing for these kids an identity they themselves didn‚Äôt choose. We‚Äôve all gone through phases of deleting Facebook photos from 15 years ago because it doesn‚Äôt reflect our current self image. What‚Äôs to be said of giving people an opportunity to change if everything they‚Äôve ever said or done is recorded somewhere? Twitter. Instagram. TikTok. Facebook. Every post is cementing us in a way.\nI think it‚Äôs better to forget yesterday. Because it doesn‚Äôt have to have any bearing on where you‚Äôre going tomorrow. It can if you let it. But your past doesn‚Äôt have to define you.\n\n\nTakeaways\nWould you rather spend hours setting up digital automatic and manual tracking systems just to learn what you could by opening a gratitude journal every day? Sometimes less is more. I don‚Äôt think digital self surveillance is a direction we should go. (Not to mention the moment you do get hacked you‚Äôll deeply regret it.)\nEven blogging can be dangerous for your career. Never know what‚Äôs gonna come back to haunt you years later.\nSo I should be careful what I say here, that is if I ever care to work for a self surveillance company in the future.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

So it represents the average price of a year 2000 with 0 miles, Limited trim, without all wheel drive. This allows us to now see what the average effect of, say, year is, holding all else constant. Every unit is in terms of dollars, so we can see that for as.factor(year)2013 that 2013 cars are worth $1,267 more than 2012 cars. This makes sense.\nI scaled mileage to be in the thousands so that it‚Äôs a little easier to interpret. So we see that for every 1,000 miles you drive a Ford Edge, it decreases the value of the car by $91 dollars. This tells you a few things. One, if I‚Äôm being offered two cars that are 10K miles different, there should be about a ~$900 difference in the car.\nSecond, if I‚Äôm planning on driving my car 30k miles over the next two years, how much should I expect the price to drop just due to mileage? Well, about -$91 * 30 = -$2,730. And maybe if you bought a 2014 model, two years later it could perhaps be like owning a 2012 model today. What‚Äôs the two-year difference between a 2014 and a 2012 model? About $3,160 dollars."

So yea, just by getting the 2017 model you‚Äôll lose $3,000 in the first year. See how 2016 is only $502 dollars more than the 2015? Having the 2015 model is practically the same price as a 2016. So you might as well buy the 2016 model and save a year of wear.\nWell, my theory kind of starts breaking down because 2015 cars and 2014 cars are similarly spaced as 2014 and 2013 ones. So maybe I shouldn‚Äôt read too much into this. But the ability to see these trends shouldn‚Äôt stop you from asking important questions, like, why is there a difference between years?\nWhen investigating the Nissan Murano, I observed a $5430 difference between 2015 and 2014. That‚Äôs non-trivial considering the other years were equally spaced. Doing a little research I saw that Nissan changed the 2015 Murano style, and the new style was apparently worth a lot more. Turns out the same thing happened here for the Ford Edge - the 2015 model is slightly longer with redesigned interior.\nYou can also use this framework to get a decent sense for what features are important to you. Like, is having all wheel drive really worth $1,277? If you live in an area where it snows, it probably is. But if you live in Florida, you may not need it.\nNot only is this framework helpful for comparing within-make-model differences, it helps you get a sense of between-make-model differences. Say, comparing the Ford Edge with the Nissan Murano and the Toyota RAV4. The coefficient for milage on the Edge is -$91. On the Murano it‚Äôs -$83, and on the RAV4 -$61. Remember this is the cost per 1,000 miles. That tells me that if I ‚Äòspend‚Äô 30k miles on a car over two years, I‚Äôll lose -$2,730 on the Edge, but only -$1,830 on the RAV4, saving me $900. This also validates that Toyotas hold their value more."

    "text": "Identify a good market deal (and how TrueCar might do it)\nBeyond the research above, you can use such a model to identify deals in the market and guide your buying decision. Here‚Äôs how:\n\nMake a PriceFinder: Get the residuals (actual minus predicted value) for each car. The more negative the residual, the more this car is a good price! This may be how TrueCar and CarGurus get their ‚Äòdeals‚Äô. They fit a model (probably one better than what I‚Äôve created here) and use its residuals to value each car.\nIdentify ‚Äòoverpriced‚Äô cars and try to possibly haggle those dealers down. Again, use the residuals here.\nUse this model to predict ‚Äòout-of-sample‚Äô cars. You can use this model built on TrueCar data and find a car on the classifieds or another site and evaluate whether it‚Äôs a good deal or not.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of how we do that. First, let‚Äôs predict a hypothetical 2015 SEL Ford Edge FWD with 27.6k miles:\n\nthat_car &lt;- as.data.frame(list(\n  year = 2015,\n  mileage = 27.6,\n  trim = 'SEL',\n  awd = 0\n))\n\npredict(mod, newdata = that_car)\n\n##        1 \n## 23520.13\nWe‚Äôd expect, on average, such a car to cost $23,520.13. Is what the dealer‚Äôs offering you above or below that? If they‚Äôre offering $25,000 then you know the car is $1,479.87 higher than what you might expect."

As George Box said, ‚ÄúAll models are wrong, but some are useful.‚Äù But here are some quick ways to improve this model:\n\nCheck for interactions. An interaction between miles and year would tell you whether the effect of miles would change across different years. For example, I think adding 10k miles to a 2017 would devalue the car more steeply than adding 10k miles to a 2012 model. During my quick research I checked for interactions, but I didn‚Äôt find many to be significant and I chose to ignore them for simplicity.\nUse a linear trend for year rather than a ‚Äòfactor‚Äô trend. I‚Äôve chosen here to treat year as a factor, which implies that I think that each year is completely different. Had I used year as a numeric feature, I could have possibly interpreted year as, ‚ÄúEach additional year increases/decreases the price by X on average, holding all else constant.‚Äù I liked the simplicity of thinking that each year was different, and since cars usually update models every four years, I wanted to be able to see where this happened. You couldn‚Äôt easily see this if year were a linear trend. Objectively, what would be a good way to choose? Fit both models and see which had better R-squared or AIC.\nDo model diagnostics. Check the residual plot to make sure the errors are normally distributed. Check for outliers. Each of these affects the accuracy of your residuals. I did some brief checks and was genearlly satisfied."

    "text": "Takeaways\nSo, a data scientist walks into a dealership with a computer with a registry of thousands of used cars on it. He negotiates with the front-office salesman. And the salesman says‚Ä¶\n\nNon-statistical considerations\nWhen you‚Äôre buying a car from a dealership, remember that it‚Äôs their job to sell you that car. Here are other random things I learned to think about during the car-buying process.\n\nHow many miles has it been driven, and how old is it? (We found a car with 45,000 miles in one year. That‚Äôs almost two trips around the entire world in a year! This is also 3750 miles per month (a cross-country US trip), or about 125 miles per day. What kind of driving do you have to do in a year to get that?\nHow many prior owners were there?\nWas the car previously a rental? A lease? A fleet?\nRental: Abused by X number of people? But also perhaps better maintained by rental companies?\nLease: What kind of person would lease?\nFleet: Probably a corporate car. Like a rental, but different kind of drivers.\nWhere did the car come from?\nIs there snow where they live? And do they use salt on the roads there? (Salt = rust underneath)\nWhat else does the geography tell you about the possible wear on the car (causing long-term problems)\nWhat does the CarFax or Autocheck say?\nWas the car sold at auction? When? What could the time between sales tell you about the car?\nIf someone gets into an accident and doesn‚Äôt report it, the CarFax won‚Äôt tell you. I drove 45 minutes to look at a ‚Äògreat‚Äô deal only to learn the door was nearly falling off.\nGood luck haggling the dealer down. Car dealerships don‚Äôt usually make that much on the car, but make their money on warranties and fees. Your best chance is to haggle on the deals being offered (terms and agreements).\nDon‚Äôt get the powertrain warranty. This is like the ‚Äúfrench fries‚Äù of the auto industry. Pure profit.\nEvery dealership has quota. Going in at the end of the month might help you, but the dealership will be packed.\nUsed cars are bought at auction. Carmax buys all their cars at auction and only keeps 1/3 of them. Local dealers also get their cars this way, and they don‚Äôt always know what the car looks like till it gets to their lot. Check the Carfax to see if any prior dealers ‚Äòflipped‚Äô the car quickly.\n\nUsed cars have a shelf life. If a car isn‚Äôt sold in 45-60 days, some dealerships might have to auction off the car. That means you‚Äôll see a tiering in the price. Less-favorable cars will see the price drop several times in its life cycle. Check CarGurus to see how many times the price has dropped, and try to guess for yourself if it might drop again (or just get sold). They know their prices. They‚Äôve got their back-office guys looking at every price of every same car within 100 mile radius. While I‚Äôm also able to get as many of those cars as available on TrueCar, I‚Äôm not able to segment by all the various features. It‚Äôs easy to webscrape for Make, Model, Year, AWD/FWD, and maybe V6 engine, but it‚Äôs very hard to get the details like leather, sunroof, twin-turbo, etc. That‚Äôs where the pricing gets really interesting.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nUltimately, a car is bought by irrational humans, and sold by more experienced ones too. So all of this data will probably go out the door when you try to make a deal.\nSo a data scientist walked into several dealerships, and left frustrated because nobody budged on their prices. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much data I have, or what I think I know, everyone‚Äôs got their price."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The keys for me for job satisfaction are now pretty basic:\n\nIs my manager supportive and someone I like spending time with?\nIs the work continuously interesting? Will I develop skills that are likely to bring interesting opportunities in the future?\nIs there incentive alignment between what I offer and what the company needs?\n\nThis blog post will attempt to describe my thoughts on what makes for a fulfilling career. It‚Äôs a hard question. Maybe something in here is valuable as you search for your ‚Äúideal‚Äù career.\n\nLikely useless career advice\nNow for a stream of consciousness about corporate employment‚Ä¶\nSome say a job should help you 1) earn or 2) learn and if neither then leave. But that framework doesn‚Äôt really work because you can learn anything anywhere.\nKnowledge is accretive. As I look back on jobs I didn‚Äôt love, I still learned things. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the type of consulting I was doing 10 years ago, but I‚Äôve now started a consulting firm and having had that experience is helpful. So it‚Äôs all kind of gray. I didn‚Äôt like pulling weeds as a kid but I‚Äôm now pulling weeds as a homeowner so yea, I‚Äôm glad I know how to do that.\n\n\nwhat is life anyway?\nPer Guide to Decision Making, ‚Äúresulting‚Äù may apply if you say you made a good decision because you enjoyed a job. By the same token you made a bad decision because you didn‚Äôt enjoy the job.\nThe reality is that ‚Äúall or nothing thinking‚Äù is more of a cognitive bias, per The Coddling of the American Mind and The Worry Cure. And so, you‚Äôre going to learn things as long as you‚Äôre remotely interested in learning things. Whether they satisfy your Working Genius is another matter.\n\n\nI want my ‚Äúdream‚Äù job though\nCan you land your dream job? Or is it a myth? 30-40% of first time marriages end in divorce. And not all of the remaining 70-60% are blissfully happy either. But many of those 70% ARE blissfully happy. Or they will be. Or they were and they will be again maybe or something‚Ä¶\nMarriage and work are similar: they‚Äôre a type of relationship.\nHappiness in a relationship takes both people being committed to the happiness of the other. One sided relationships eventually crumble. But if both people remain committed to the other‚Äôs happiness, and other certain caveats‚Ä¶, the marriage will prove valuable to both for their whole lives.\n\n\nProfessional and Life happiness\nHappiness to me comes in two forms: doing the best I can with the circumstances I have (the cards I‚Äôve been dealt) and choosing environments that are healthy (the game that gives me the cards).\nIt‚Äôs about 1) what you‚Äôre doing and 2) the environment and context you‚Äôre doing it in.\nThis is life. Some games are fun to me. Others less fun by definition. But any game may be better than no game. Unless the game involves a high risk of me breaking my spine. Nuance.\nPoint is: it takes a long while to find what environments you thrive in. Any company can offer just one or potentially many environments depending on their size or the role.\nSo if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre interested in, you must explore. You try.\n\n\nFinding the best environment\nFirst on the environment.\nJane Austen is better at this than me. Take all those sisters in Pride and Prejudice who have varying views on love and stability. Some sisters believe in true love. Others think it‚Äôs a myth and instead choose financial stability. Of course true love wins in the end.\nI suppose work is very similar: you‚Äôre going to get out of it what you believe is possible. After all: you work with and for people.\nIt will take time and risks to figure out what environments you thrive in, kind of like dating. The interview is part of the process. Bring in a company is another part. Talking to friends in other companies is a third part. Thinking grass is greener is a fourth part, and so forth. That‚Äôs life.\nYour needs also change in your career. As you change, your preferences change. It‚Äôs up to you to learn how to match your preferences with your environments, and how to accommodate your preferences within your environments.\nIf you don‚Äôt like your roommate, you can leave early or wait till your contract expires or etc etc. or you can try to work it out and get to know your roommate. All are options. Which you choose is up to you. In the end, a good environment takes two. But it also takes one to instigate change for the better for both. Reciprocity.\n\n\nExperiment Your Way to a Happy Career\nThen there‚Äôs the thing you‚Äôre doing.\nYou can ‚Äútry‚Äù anything by doing it yourself. Do you want to be a teacher? Go try to volunteer teaching. Do you want to be a coder? Spend 20 hours trying to build an app. Do you want to be a doctor? Volunteer with doctors.\nFour ways of learning what you like emerge. The quality of the information is ordered top to bottom while the amount of time it takes to get that information is bottom to top:\n\nReading about an industry or job is kind of helpful.\nTalking to people in the field is more helpful.\nFollowing and shadowing those people is even more useful.\nBut actually doing the work is the only way to really know.\n\nYou can read about 50 jobs to see what piques your interest and help you learn what‚Äôs out there. Next, you can increase the chance of pursuing a job you like by trying to do it without actually having to get the job.\nYou can get a pretty good sense by doing little projects similar to what the real work is going to be.\n\n\nDon‚Äôt Not Try Something Because of a Dumb Reason\nA lot of people think they shouldn‚Äôt do something because they‚Äôre not good enough. Even professionals. (Tiger Woods just had his worst round of his life, but I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs still better than you.)\nOr they think they shouldn‚Äôt try something because they‚Äôre not yet credentialed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try this at home kids‚Äù. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôre taught.\nAnd that‚Äôs kind of the great myth: the myth of titles and credentials. That you need to be experienced at something to be able to do that thing. But that‚Äôs a lie. Instead, you should only pursue the credential if it offers you something you can‚Äôt otherwise get (due to red tape). And until you get the credential, you‚Äôre just spending a few hours every day learning stuff and maybe passing an exam at the end. So if you ignore the exam, what‚Äôs stopping you from just picking up the activities today you may find rewarding?\nI once spent a single week shadowing dentists in an open room in Honduras. I was a Spanish translator for these American dentists that came through. I felt pretty confident by the end that I could probably do one of the fillings just because it really wasn‚Äôt that complicated. And the dentists told me so. Once you look at 100 cavities in a mouth it‚Äôs not hard to spot them. This was the easiest way to de-myth this job: watching and observing.\n\nIt was actually really boring. Once you‚Äôve seen 100 cavities you‚Äôve seen them all I think. Glad I figured that out quickly! But I know there‚Äôs someone out there that disagrees with me and I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôll be drilling my teeth and not me.\n\n90% of most people‚Äôs jobs could be taught via apprenticeship, like the good old days. Today‚Äôs world of credentials makes people think they‚Äôre incapable of doing a pretty simple task: putting a tool into someone‚Äôs tooth. But before you invest 8 years of your life in dental school, why not go be a dental hygienist for 1 year? Instead of doing a coding bootcamp, why not just code in your basement for a month after hours? This is the way to find what you like.\nWhether you enjoy doing that thing that created value for people can only be discovered by doing it.\n\n\nPeople Hire you Because you offer a Service or Value. Period.\nYour real job is to create value for people. It‚Äôs not a title. It‚Äôs not a credential. It‚Äôs not mandated or necessary in society. And if you were born 100 years before today or 100 years after the job may not exist. So think about opportunities in this way.\nA healthier way to thinking about corporate life is: what creates value? Is there a reasonable exchange of goods for my offering?\nI‚Äôm capable of many offerings. But they‚Äôre hiring for one offering. That‚Äôs life.\nIf I were selling apricots, and someone was offering me peanuts, would I exchange my apricots for their peanuts? Well, if we were the only two people sure.\nBut maybe I feel like I can get some avocados for my apricots. So can I find an avocado dealer? Do they even like apricots? Do they already have enough apricots? And if yes to all the above, are they even in the mood to exchange for apricots today? Lastly, do they like me?\n\n\n\nWork is just an exchange of goods\n\n\nGetting a job is more of a negotiation than anything. And everything in work is a negotiation. Read Never Split the Difference and that becomes quite apparent. Work is nothing fancy. It‚Äôs not a title. It‚Äôs not a degree. It‚Äôs just doing little activities.\nAnd after you‚Äôve 1000 similar activities you‚Äôre soon labeled a data scientist or a farmer. And if you circled the right boxes on an exam and got a piece of paper you‚Äôre now a doctor/dentist. But the paper or the title don‚Äôt make you good at that thing. My point: create value, not titles.\n\n\nIn Sum\nSo yes. I‚Äôve gone on a rant here. But hey this is my blog. I‚Äôm trying to talk about the deeper issues at how to choose a profession or a company within that profession. I‚Äôm trying to break away from the titles and credentials that blind our thinking away from the more important questions of ‚Äúwhat activities bring me joy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow will I know it?‚Äù And ‚Äúwill someone pay me for doing this activity?‚Äù And ‚Äúhow do I find an environment of people that will enable me to do valuable activities and make it a pleasant place to work?‚Äù (PS, some say to not work for Elon Musk‚Ä¶unless you enjoy his working style.)\nLong story short: make sure the company hiring you actually needs your skills to run their business. Strive to find better opportunities by putting yourself out there and trying new things. And find people you like working with. All the rest is just a bonus.\nThe most dangerous thing is to get all those good things on your first job because then you try to self actualize per Maslov‚Äôs hierarchy of needs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt it always seem to go That you don‚Äôt know what you got ‚Äôtil it‚Äôs gone?‚Äù (Lyrics) So if you get a ‚Äúbad‚Äù job just know it‚Äôs part of the process and one day 10 years from now you‚Äôll probably be grateful you had that job anyway.\nIf I didn‚Äôt actually answer your questions that‚Äôs because some questions are a perennial debate. Some popular people hate the idea of work-life balance, some embrace it. Go figure. And keep searching to find someone who sees work and career the same way you do, because there are millions of jobs in the work. Hundreds of millions.\n\n\nBooks to read\nIt helps to get perspective when choosing where you want to work.\n\nHow to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices - have a decision framework\nThe 6 Types of Working Genius - understand who you are.\nOvercoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team - it helps to recognize a good company by first understanding a bad company.\nThe Old Man and the Sea - a job is a job at the end of the day. It‚Äôs just fishing.\n\n\n\nPractical Questions\nThings I‚Äôd think about in your shoes:\n\nwhat loosely sounds interesting? Who perhaps knows someone with that type of role? How do I get 15 min with that person, or a quick email? (Use 6 degrees of separation to your advantage)\ndo I have an ideal salary? What‚Äôs realistic? (Levels.fyi, don‚Äôt over or undersell yourself. Figure out market rates and if your job will support your desired lifestyle in a location)\nwhat‚Äôs the entry level job that gets me some experience 50% in the right direction that I‚Äôm interested in?\nwhere will I learn?\nDoes this company offer flexibility to try new things?\n\nSometimes job searching is helped by thinking by contrast:\n\nwhat can someone not pay me $500k per year to do? $300k? $100k? (Nobody could pay me $500k to be an investment banker and work 100 hour weeks. Maybe they could pay me $2M and I‚Äôd do it for 2 years ya know? But $500 isn‚Äôt enough.)\n\nAs you‚Äôre interviewing:\n\nwhat incentivizes people on a daily basis?\nwill this job be around in 2 years? Why? Why not? Why might they fire me in 6 months for things 100% outside of my control? (Recessions, business strategy shifts, etc)\nhow essential is my skillset to what they do?\nwhat relationship do people have with my would-be manager?\n\nQuestions to potentially ask your hiring manager:\n\nHow do you see me fitting into this role?\nWhy might this role not be a good fit for me?\nWho‚Äôs the highest ranking person who‚Äôs quit or been fired recently and why?\nHow do you define success for this role?\n\nQuestions to ask your peers you‚Äôre interviewing with:\n\ndescribe your relationship with your manager?\ndescribe the communication patterns of the team?\ndescribe how decisions are made? What‚Äôs a recent decision that was made? describe your role in how the team made that decision?\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nWriting a Tech Resume\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

A bit gruesome. But, what in today‚Äôs news cycle is positive? How can we be better readers of the news when it‚Äôs targeted at making us angry?\nFoxes and turkeys are highlighted in the news all the time and it‚Äôs often the worst of humanity. The goal of many authors is to evict emotion from you so you‚Äôll keep reading. Anger. Fear. Worry. Those keep you hooked.\nWhat‚Äôs the author‚Äôs motive? Often we have to guess it. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice instead if authors were transparent about why they were writing a story:\n\nAuthor 1: I‚Äôm a Turkey conservationist with a passion for protecting turkeys from the rampant fox problem we have. Growing up, a Turkey saved my life when I was drowning in a lake.\nAuthor 2: I‚Äôm a narcissist who hates foxes because one time they ate my cat.

    "text": "The GTD framework preaches something to the effect of ‚Äúget every todo item down and into a system. It may take dozens or hundreds of tasks to get it all out.‚Äù Essentially, if a task is in your mind, it will slow you down. But if you put it down on paper, it will free your mind to think on other things. Also, more ideas will come.\nI‚Äôve put perhaps a hundred things down on paper in the last few days. Interestingly, ideas I had forgotten about came back to my mind. I wrote these down.\nThere got to a point today though where I had so much on my screen I felt overwhelmed. How will I ever sort through all this mess?\nThankfully, most of the things don‚Äôt need to get done and are either ‚Äúeventually‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeday maybe‚Äù tasks, and not ‚Äúasap‚Äù tasks. So just ignore them.\nAnd secondly, I always ‚Äúknow‚Äù what‚Äôs most important. This documentation process doesn‚Äôt change that. It just helps me to get all the distractions out of my head and down on paper.\nSpending time organizing all this stuff seems like a potential waste. But what I realize is that it improves my just-in-time recall. If earlier in the day I planned to buy a dish scrubber in the evening, when the evening rolls around that task magically comes back to my mind. So it‚Äôs really just front loading all the decision making and prioritizing. I think our brains are capable of more subconscious processing than we realize.\n(Pause entry to buy dish scrubber‚Ä¶) okay, I‚Äôm back.\nAnother idea that‚Äôs having an effect on me is the 2 min rule. If a task takes less than 2 min, don‚Äôt organize it. Just do it. Powerfully, this mindset helps me to care less about two min tasks. Or, sometimes there‚Äôs a tendency to over exaggerate the stress something will cause. Like buying a scrubber could be a 10 min task if you want to find the perfect one. But if you only allocate yourself 2 min, you realize this is only a $6 decision and I have better things to do with my time.\nLastly, I love being deliberate about tasks by writing down the intended outcome of a task. It‚Äôs very easy as a data scientist to get swallowed up in all the weeds. Or, rather, when your task is to dig up a gem it‚Äôs easy to get distracted by all the weeds that need to be pulled that are in your way. So by being clear about the reason I‚Äôm diving into the data in the first place helps me re-surface less scathed. Data are a dirty business‚Ä¶\n\nTakeaways\nThe effect of the GTD framework?\n\nLess FOMO. By writing down everything I can see clearly that 1) I don‚Äôt have time for all of it and 2) the stuff I care about pops up.\nI don‚Äôt have to worry about what I‚Äôm not doing because I can easily say no to it as I say yes to something better.\nI can see broader connections between a litany of things. This helps me prioritize what my subconscious has been telling me by nagging me about X ideas.\nIf I start working on something not in my list it makes me ask if this thing is fealty worth my time when I know I have a ton of other stuff to do. (Recency bias I spoke about in my other blog post.)\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Does it have interest/patience to sit there and learn it? Does GPT 4Vision have the ability to figure out these objective functions?\nWe learn by objective functions. Minimize wrong answers on a test. Minimize missed baskets on the basketball court. Minimize rejections in a sales funnel. Maximize great conversation and connection at a dinner party.\nHumans learn very quickly. For now, robots are being isolated to specific tasks and their results are impressive.

Meaning, an employee will be kind while holding the door open for someone (be kind), but also provide explicit growth-oriented feedback.\nSigns of a bad culture are therefore evident in the opposite of my definition. Like Lord of the Flies, employees are fending for survival and constantly exploring the boundaries because there are now rules of government. Employees that can‚Äôt recount what the values are or demonstrate how the company mechanically employs them are hoping for natural demonstration but get confused when they get mixed signals.\nToxic cultures can achieve financial success. ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù has no concrete definition, but probably reveals people trying to survive on the island rather than thrive in a civilization. It stands, therefore, that a great culture will endure the battles of business, and come out tighter. At some point it won‚Äôt matter how bright your people are, how clever your IP is, or how many customers you have: culture is the rudder.\n\n\n\nA small boat with a large rudder will get where it needs to go. But a large boat with a small rudder is doomed\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

In another occasion I wanted to learn PySpark over SQL because Python‚Ä¶\nWhile I don‚Äôt regret that choice per se, because I chose something else I was interested in, I‚Äôve largely come to realize that I don‚Äôt care what programming language I‚Äôm using. I care about getting the job done.\nAlso, I‚Äôm probably over the 10,000 hours of something, I just don‚Äôt know what. Am I an ML expert? Data expert? SQL? Python? R?\nIs it the application of the skill that makes you an expert? I‚Äôm not sure. Because I think novices can do some incredible things if they hone in.\nIf you read one book on a topic, you‚Äôre by no means an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù, but you probably know more about that topic than 99% of the nation. I learned this when I spent 6 months diving into the home security industry for my first job. Pretty sure I knew more about that than anyone I spoke to. Was I an expert? I really only had maybe 300 hours. Maybe I was inexperienced. Sure.\nAnd who spends literally 10,000 hours on any one thing? Like 10,000 hours on XGBoost? Image classification? Deep learning? Machine learning? A/B testing? Spreadsheets? Generalist vs specialist, etc. if you‚Äôre an ML scientist at Google, you worry about very different things than an ML scientist at a startup. At a startup, you worry about your bigquery allocation and pipeline failures. At Google you worry about what your 5th skip VP is going to deprecate that month.\nThat‚Äôs just the nature of education. There are so many things in the world to know‚Ä¶that being an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù is a relative thing. But I agree that working hard and learning useful things helps you innovate faster.\n\n\n\nI‚Äôd change my opinion on being an expert if I needed to beat Rocky.\n\n\nLast thing, the crux is: don‚Äôt compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to yourself. That‚Äôs how you assess your progress.\nBut I‚Äôd argue: why even compare yourself to yourself? Compare your solution to the problem. Does it matter if you have 10,000 hours? No.¬†What matters is if the solution fits. This is why innovations and disruptions come from unexpected places: because novices can nail solutions.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "Businesses are Launching Like Crazy\nThere‚Äôs never been a better time to start a business. The Census shows there are over 200,000 new business applications per month more than pre pandemic.\n\nWhat‚Äôs driving this?\nListening to The Unintended Consequences of Working from Home it dawned on me that there‚Äôs a hyper acceleration of innovation happening.\nConsider the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and StableDiffusion. Chamath Palihapitiya discusses the expansive applications for these services. What was once SaaS will become MaaS (models as a service). There will be models for everything: copy writing, code debugging, converting wireframes into working apps, ad generation, book writing‚Ä¶\nWhile tools like ChatGPT are just in demo mode, it‚Äôs wildly apparent they‚Äôll be an impetus for new ideas and reducing the friction of getting to the answer. For example, as a data scientist if I need boilerplate code to clean some data, I can ask ChatGPT for the 80% solution. I‚Äôm already spending 30% of my day copying code snippets from StackOverflow and making it work for my problem. ChatGPT will just accelerate that process. 10 years from now if Neuralink can read my thoughts I don‚Äôt even need a keyboard to do this‚Ä¶we‚Äôll build things at the speed of thought.\nConsider this for writers and marketers. They‚Äôll use ChatGPT to unblock them, generate ideas, and get started. Innovation across the board will accelerate because the kinetic friction to getting started will reduce to zero. You can then spend your time on the editing and refining.\n\n\nThe Best Time to Start a Business\nI digress. Why is now the best time to build a software business?\n\nCompute is cheap. Gone are the days of having to build a server to prototype and idea.\nBarriers to prototyping are nearly free and scaling with the cloud is nearly infinite. Consider how the Gas App can launch to 100,000 new users per day with just a few developers.\nModeling is now easy. All cloud services have their own AutoML tools to build machine learning models for you.\n\nThe center of all of this is scalable data infrastructure and AI.\n\n\nFuture of Data Science\nThe data scientist of today may still be using sklearn to manually do hyperparameter tuning, but the data scientist of tomorrow will either be exclusively building MaaS B2B products or be the one person in their organization who will leverage all the MaaS tools.\nIf we can ask ChatGPT for complex answers it learned from the internet, why couldn‚Äôt something similar be trained on your company‚Äôs internal data? If that‚Äôs possible, then why couldn‚Äôt you just have a Q&A session with your internal ChatGPT? Consider the following example:\n\n‚ÄúHey KITT, what are the user segments generating the most revenue on Tuesdays at 5pm?‚Äù (Analytics)\n‚ÄúHow many sales do we anticipate from these users next Tuesday?‚Äù (Machine Learning)\n‚ÄúWhat ads have been most effective for us in driving new sales in the past 7 days?‚Äù (Statistics)\n‚ÄúOkay, KITT, generate 3 variants of that ad for next Tuesday‚Äù (StableDiffusion generating a new Ad)\n‚ÄúI like ads A, B and C. launch an experiment on Facebook/TikTok, run it for three days and dynamically allocate ad spend to the best ad.‚Äù (Business integrations, statistics, ML models)\n\nThe data scientist of the future will be the one with deep understanding of these tools and an awareness of their biases. It will be very difficult to know when they‚Äôre lying to you. The in-house data scientist will be keen on knowing the biases in the data fed into these algorithms and how to make judgments on where to go next.\nEarly stage companies won‚Äôt need data scientists because most of this stuff will be off the shelf and easy for an engineer to integrate. That means that the data scientists will join these MaaS companies to build out optimized products that solve these niche problems.\n\n\nTakeaways\nData Scientists shouldn‚Äôt be scared their jobs will disappear. They should be excited that they‚Äôll be joining companies that automate what they‚Äôre currently doing and offer it as a service.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "A treatise on desire, uncertainty, commitment, and execution toward a goal.\nDescartes proposed that if you pick a direction and walk in a straight line you‚Äôll eventually leave the forest. This assumes you want to leave the forest.\nA desire is a persistent yearning. Desires take root and, when nurtured, become reality.\nAn achieved desire is a blend of hope, faith, and charity. A hope (goal) is the edge of the forest. Walking is faith (belief + action). Charity is long suffering and persistence - the ability to maintain hope and faith.\nA hope is envisioned or observed. If observed, there is believed certainty in achievement, with uncertainty in the path. An envisioned hope has uncertainty in both the path and the outcome. You might die trying. Envisioned hopes are impossible only when the path is not made clear. Thought makes the path clear.\nA clear path is a plan. A plan is a sequence of informed choices and actions leading towards a goal, a consequence. A causal effect. Reconnaissance is the finite time and energy spent collecting information. Reason invites spending time and energy proportional to the cost or impact of the plan and goal. Judgment determines which choices and actions are taken.\nCommitment is recognizing many roads lead to Rome, and only one of them can be walked to actually get there.\nLuck is unknown things. Some things could have been known with more reconnaissance. Other things could never have been known or anticipated. Luck either enables or disables the path. Luck happens post plan, post deliberation. It‚Äôs the unknown distance between you and the forest‚Äôs edge. Hindsight bias is the present mind‚Äôs ability to mistakenly believe uncertainty was always certain. ‚ÄúI should have known‚Äù is an oxymoron.\nEnabling luck makes possible the goal. Disabling luck makes difficult the goal, perhaps impossible. Impossible is usually a state of mind or the laws of physics, but usually never both.\nTilt is the mist of blindness caused by the presence of luck. Tilt distracts from information and commitment, a bias caused by observed outcomes that were previously uncertain.\nCommitment is time and energy. Time is measured by rotations of the earth or attempts made. Energy is measured by willingness to roll the dice again.\nCommitment is also reconnaissance. More actions, more information. Ignorance is choosing not to see the information. Stubbornness is seeing it, and maintaining the status quo for thrill of ego. Humility is hunger for more information.\nUncertainty invites fear and worry. Perceived time spent amplifies fear and worry. Uncertainty in the path. Uncertainty in the destination, etc.\nA plan is the process of committing to something knowing that hindsight bias creeps in with each step. The plan mitigates the drag of hindsight bias.\nFear and anxiety are compounded when accomplishment doesn‚Äôt happen within perceived time. Human nature is to lose all track of time when in a task, so time should be planned for. Time to evaluate the plan and assess new information should also be decided in the plan.\nCommitment to the plan is a recognition of the infallibility of human emotion. Judgment is evaluating if the plan could be improved, and the plan includes time/effort-base checkpoints for evaluation. Commitment is the recognition that, while the direction you‚Äôre heading may not be the right one, (shortest path between you and the edge of the forest which you can‚Äôt know at onset), walkikg straight is better than circling from changing direction multiple times. Straight lines are incapable of not exiting. Circles may exit but are capable of not exiting.\nIf new information overrides understood information at the time of the plan, and changes the decision that would have been made given the circumstances at the time of the plan, then wisdom and humility is the ability to change direction despite how many miles walked (sunk cost).\nWalking in a straight line in business is ‚Äúwalking in accordance to the plan‚Äù. The time spent deliberating the plan should be proportional to the costs and benefits of the action, which requires judgment. Inspiration is praying that God will guide you and enable your plan.\nArrogance is believing you have infinite energy and time. Optimism is appreciating that any mile walked strengthens your legs, that the direction you chose may not match the imagined ideal. Self awareness is appreciating that the human mind is capable of any imagination, and few imaginations consider accurately all costs or benefits of reality. Imaginations are powerful, but can cause circling, and are most powerful during the plan. After the plan, use imagination to accomplish it. Before the plan, use imagination to design it. But don‚Äôt use imagination during the plan to redesign it, I.e, avoid circling.\nAction gets stuff done."

    "text": "Tags and lists are identical except Lists have sections and views (such as Kanban). In a list you can sort by tag and vice versa. But each task can only appear in one list whereas tags are infinite. I noticed that choosing which list something belongs to can be cumbersome if it‚Äôs in a nested list, so I want only high level lists (no folders) and have this be simple. I also have ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù and ‚Äúwork‚Äù tags which have projects within them, so I don‚Äôt really see why I‚Äôd need to duplicate this. On second thought, each task can only belong to one work project so it‚Äôd make sense for this to be my grouping. I suppose I just don‚Äôt want to manage all that. Or, I chose to use tags to manage my projects because I was cheap and I can only have 9 lists on the free version but unlimited tags?

We all want more stuff.\n\n\n\nWhen in doubt, toss it out\n\n\nWith a small living space and a growing family I‚Äôve grown accustomed to throwing stuff out. I grew up in a bigger house than I have now so there was space for everything. Now there‚Äôs space for very little. It‚Äôs actually a great feeling because I know what‚Äôs in every box (after doing some deep cleaning over winter break).\nI remember helping a friend move in high school. Endless hoards of products, products, products. Three moving trucks. Why? I wondered.\nMy philosophy now is: RAM and Hard drive.\nRAM: the random access memory. The things you see when you open doors affect your brain state. Your brain can only hold so much. If you live in clutter you have clutter. So the things you see in your house should reflect what you can hold in memory.\n\nToys should have a theme (blocks, action figures, doll house). If it doesn‚Äôt match a theme, it‚Äôs gone (begone random slap bracelet! ‚ÄúAfuera!!!‚Äù, (quote from new Argentine President))\nThings you see should be things you use. Don‚Äôt use flower every day? Don‚Äôt have it in the pantry. Put it in the corner thing. Cereal every day? Put that front and center.\n\nThen long-storage is the hard drive. It‚Äôs about keeping stuff you know you‚Äôll want. This is easier to say than do.\n\nHoliday decoration? (Theme) keep those in the attic, out of sight out of mind. But when you need it you know where it is.\nYou get the point.\n\nThe same goes for code. Maintenance and search cost increase as you add garbage. When it doubt, delete code.

I once asked someone at the beach to leash their dog, and they slightly rebuked me, ‚Äúthis is a dog friendly beach.‚Äù Well, so it is, I thought, grumpily. I complained to a family member about this grumpy dog owner.\nMoods escalate. And negative moods are even more pervasive and contagious than positive ones. They say a disgruntled customer tells more friends and family than happy ones. Why is this?\nIn the ‚ÄúBlack Cat‚Äù (The Best of Edgar Allen Poe), Poe describes a gruesome tale man who wanted to do evil just for the sake of it. That it‚Äôs in his nature. Not because you want to do the thing, but because you want to do a forbidden thing. The same goes the other way, for sure. But I think we trend slightly pessimistic because being an optimist is more beneficial, more rewarding and therefore more difficult.\nA leader once told me when I was managing a team, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll pick up on everything you do or say.‚Äù Oddly, I was picking up on what he was saying.\nSo when you lead, lead carefully. Whether in home or work, lead with kindness, compassion, and restraint. Speak three kind words before a negative. Ask to understand before assuming. Lead as a servant. It takes all the effort to overcome negative vibes, and who better equipped than the leader to do it?\nDon‚Äôt be Moriarty:\n\n‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you be more hopeful for a change?‚Äù\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Blood flowed through the broken flesh. The pores of the flesh.\n\nBread, being porous, is also absorbent. ‚Üí He absorbed our problems. He internalized them inside His flesh to the point that his own blood didn‚Äôt have space internally anymore and exited through the pores.\n\n\n\nThe pores in bread remind me of the pores that let blood for me\n\n\n\n\nSupporting Scriptures\n\nAnd lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people. Mosiah 3.7\n\n\n\nMeaning\nThe Savior suffered an enormous amount. Even the thought of imagining blood coming out of my pores evokes thoughts of feeling so much physically overwhelming internal pressure or emotional agony that it would make a human body explode.\nI can remember this when I pray. I can feel heard because He not only felt what I feel today, but he knows the future me, the past me, and the past/present/future everyone else. When I pray, I‚Äôm not approaching a distant God. I‚Äôm approaching the one that understands humanity better than any human possibly could. Someone that understands me more than I‚Äôll ever understand myself. Someone who‚Äôs been there.\nWhen I pray, I don‚Äôt have to give pretenses, because ‚Äúyour Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.‚Äù (Matthew 6.8)\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. Malachi 3.10‚Äì11\n\nThe Lord invites us to drink his blood, to drink if we are thirsty:\n\nFor I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: Isaiah 44.3\n\nBlessings will be poured out on those who covenant with Christ:\n\nYea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out, and the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house. And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads of my people. Doctrine and Covenants 110.9‚Äì10\n\nThe covenant of baptism is about pouring the spirit upon us:\n\nNow I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you? Mosiah 18.10 O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart. Mosiah 18.12 Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world. Mosiah 18.13\n\n\n\nMeaning\nWhen I take the sacrament, I renew a covenant which binds me to a Lord who is eager and capable of pouring out blessings. He does not deliver in vain. He does not deliver spitefully. He does not deliver like a carrot on a stick. In short, he is not human.\nHe delivers bountifully, readily, excitedly. When we rejoice, he rejoices (Mosiah 18.9). It pleases Him to bless us:\n\nIf ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father‚Äôs commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. John 15.10‚Äì11\n\nHis work is one of joy:\n\nAnd when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Tim Ferris describes why he doesn‚Äôt have social media on his phone:\n\nI recently deleted social media from my phone 14 days ago. I had been using Instagram until April when I quit and migrated to Twitter the rest of the year. I recently realized within days how much better I felt without social media. Happier. Legitimately happier.\nAnd why? What did I get out of it? I wasn‚Äôt growing closer to friends. That‚Äôs what texting and calling and spending time in person does. But I‚Äôd argue even texting doesn‚Äôt really strengthen a relationship because it‚Äôs so hard to properly interpret emotions and cues via text: you interpret them how you read those texts. You interpret it according to your emotional state, not the sender‚Äôs.\nPhone provides vocal emotional cues. Body language another set of emotional cues. I can get probably 70% of this out from FaceTime or Zoom. But being in person is what we‚Äôre meant for.\nThis is why we strengthen relationships locally, and fail to continue ones from high school or our previous job.\nSo what was I doing on social media? Watching clips of either strangers I don‚Äôt care about or college associates I friended (once lived locally with) that I no longer talk to.\nSo what‚Äôs the knife you‚Äôre bringing to the gun fight? When at YouTube I heard the CEO praise a team for increasing ‚Äúseconds watched‚Äù by 15% by reducing the lag of the swipes between YouTube shorts (TikTok clone). The lag reduction was in the milliseconds. Meaning: they made the slot machine more addictive.\nYour attention is being bought and manipulated by the shareholders of these companies.\n\n\n\nYes, they‚Äôre targeting specifically you. You don‚Äôt stand a chance. And you have a pocket knife, and you‚Äôre 50 feet away. Who‚Äôs gonna win?\n\n\nThey A/B test everything. This isn‚Äôt morally wrong. It‚Äôs actually quite human: we all A/B test everything every day. A joke here. A smile there. We put out feelers and see if we get a reaction. Don‚Äôt believe me? Ask my kid why he keeps throwing things in the toilet!\nBillions of dollars and the brightest minds on earth are working at FAANG. Why? They need to provide for their families and academics doesn‚Äôt pay. Non-profits don‚Äôt pay. This isn‚Äôt immoral, it just is. There are very good people working there: honest, moral people. Some of the best I‚Äôve seen in the industry. But when you get paid to maximize swipes, you maximize swipes. It‚Äôs just human nature. And some of them buy into the odd notions of ‚Äúsnackable content‚Äù, as if swiping for 30 minutes while on the toilet is what anyone wakes up excited to do. Keep on snacking‚Ä¶\nSocial media and Netflix provide a ton of value to the world in my opinion. I can use them to call anyone I want, raise money for a cause, or get likes on a cute pic of my cat (I don‚Äôt have a cat). I do see the value.\nBut the costs for me have outweighed the value.\nI do miss laughing about some random Reel. There‚Äôs nothing that can get you laughing faster than a 10 second clip paired with the right cuts and music and everything. The right meme just nails it in a way nothing else can. I miss seeing memes from my friends. But when all I do is send memes to these friends, is that a friendship?\nSince being off social media I feel like my senses have grown. I now find my kids a lot funnier, my wife funnier, and I‚Äôm able to make heavy situations lighter much easier.\nThere‚Äôs a quote in Dune that‚Äôs something like ‚ÄúIf you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken‚Äù. I‚Äôd argue my other relationships had weakened too. Time to leave the fight. I was losing.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "First seen on: Ethan Mollick on LinkedIn: I think that Google may have come out of nowhere to have the best LLM‚Ä¶ | 19 comments\nImageFX Is the tool to generate images with Google‚Äôs Gemini. I‚Äôve been a huge fan of using ChatGPT on iOS to get images for this blog. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually good or not. But it‚Äôs helped me associate a post with an idea (image), which I think is incredibly helpful for memory retention. So my theory has been: some content is better than no content. The other thought is: better learn now what these tools are and how to use them because you never know where you‚Äôre going to be able to take them. They‚Äôre like learning how to drive a car: if you can drive, you can go places.\nSo how does ImageFX compare?\n\nBattle Prompt\n\na battle of chatgpt vs Google Gemini photo generators. Psychedelic. Parasitic. Enlightened. Groovy. Ethereal. Down to earth.\n\nGoogle:\n\nAnd ChatGPT:\n\n\n\nChatGPt wins\n\n\nThis is but one test, and clearly chatGPT wins.\n\n\nFast Car Prompt\n\nImage: sports car driving along the highway. Scenic. Photographic. Realistic. Focused camera, low aperture. Beach off in the distance. Windy roads.\n\nGoogle:\n\n\n\nGemini\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nSports Car\n\n\nInterestingly, ChatGPT added a camera and had the identical photo inside the camera‚Äôs viewport. I‚Äôm really not sure how LLMs are that capable, that‚Äôs some diffusion inside diffusion.\nBut winner goes to Gemini here! That nails the image best.\nAlso, Gemini has an editor that pops up that lets you swap out backgrounds or objects. Pretty neat!\n\n\n\nPhoto editor\n\n\n\n\nHuman\nLet‚Äôs see how they do on people.\n\nImage: a seven year old brother and nine year old sister. The boy has brown hair, spiked. The girl has long curly blond hair. They‚Äôre on a swing-set together. The boy is jumping off the swing while the girl is on the swing but getting ready to. A creek and a grassy hill in the background.\n\nGoogle:\n\n\n\nAgainst Google policies\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nTwo kids Swinging\n\n\nChatGPT wins by TKO on this one. Gemini perhaps can‚Äôt generate images of kids? Not sure.\n\n\nFinal Battle: Picturesque Landscape\nNothing better than a sunset, right?\n\nSunset over the San Francisco Bay. Taken from the East, the Golden Gate Bridge is in visible. The sunset is bursting through a gentle fog, angle is taken from higher in the air, perhaps 1000 feet as if from a low helicopter view.\n\nGoogle:\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nSF sunset\n\n\nAnd a real photo taken from Google Images:\n\n\n\nWhat the sunset really looks like\n\n\nWinner here is Google Images search! Both of those photos are bad. ChatGPT nailed the fog, which Gemini omitted. Gemini is much closer to the mark but made up a city to the right. Both of them couldn‚Äôt produce the right angle for the sun. But hey, they‚Äôre both better than nothing!\n\n\nConclusion\nGemini is here! I can now use it to create images from my phone.\nAs a consumer, I think the mobile experience of ChatGPT is really great. But if I‚Äôm on desktop I may use Gemini because it gives me four variations for each prompt. And it‚Äôs free. Can‚Äôt beat free.\nBut ChatGPT can do crazy things that Gemini can‚Äôt, such as the head to head battle.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "I see a lot of executives dive into AI with a fury of excitement - the possibilities are endless. As it results, chatbots offering used cars for $1, refund policies you don‚Äôt want to stand behind and having the system generate fake legal briefs (Air Canada‚Äôs failed AI-generated Refund Policy and other AI mishaps: When you need guardrails on your AI).\nI see this with experienced executives saying ‚ÄúI want to just infuse my product with AI.‚Äù For example, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 100 PDFs and a wealth of knowledge that I want to integrate into my app‚Äù.\nImagine you‚Äôre an unknown artist. What‚Äôs more likely for success: pain something you want, or paint something by commission?\n\n\n\nHow much time will it take to build an AI apple picker vs just hiring someone?\n\n\nSoftware fails when software developers build something because it sounds like a good idea. Essentially, they build a solution looking for a problem. Or they believe ‚Äúif I build this my customers will love it.‚Äù\nThe same goes for AI. We‚Äôre at a new wave where anything is possible. Perhaps you‚Äôre so entrenched in a problem you intuitively know the solution, build something, and your customers (or coworkers) love what you‚Äôve made.\nFar more likely is you end up believing AI isn‚Äôt working.\nHere are the five questions you should ask before adopting AI:\n\nWhats the job my customer will hire my AI to do? (Know Your Customers‚Äô ‚ÄúJobs to Be Done‚Äù)\nWhy will they hire my AI?\nHow much is not having my AI costing them?\nIf my AI didn‚Äôt exists, whats the stupidest way my customers could get an 80% solution?\nIf my AI does exist in all its glory, why will it fail miserably to do the job its hired to do?\n\nToo many dive straight to a solution.\nYes, AI is and will revolutionize jobs. The first ones it‚Äôll revolutionize are the obvious ones: the boring or time intensive tasks that you‚Äôre already doing. For Hollywood, AI will replace the laborious task of generating storyboards and such (Unreal AI: Meet Sora). They‚Äôre not trying to solve world hunger (first) at open AI. They‚Äôre trying to replace jons that are already being hired for. They want to replace truck drivers with AI drivers, warriors with AI drones, and creatives (artistic, musical, and software) with AI. They invented a whole new way of doing‚Ä¶the thing that needed to be done anyway.\nDon‚Äôt solve a problem that nobody cares about. Because at this point in the economy your customer already has Google, competitors they can go to, and half baked solutions they can already muster on their own. What they need from you is a solution to their biggest problem, now.\nMaybe AI will solve that. Maybe some basic software will instead. Ask yourself these three questions:\n\nWill this save time?\nSave energy?\nSave money?\n\nIf not, it‚Äôs not worth your time, energy, or money to develop.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Books are usually far more instructive because each sentence is reviewed at least a few times if not a hundred times during the editing process.\nI noticed that once I started binging books instead of posts, my happiness and satisfaction increased.\nHere‚Äôs a strategy I‚Äôm using for learning.\n\nGet Audible and Spotify subscriptions. It has books that aren‚Äôt available on Libby (which I also use).\nStock up on free books using Libby. Hold times vary, but can be a few weeks or months for popular titles. Note: you can supply multiple library accounts.\nFor short books not on Libby, check Audible free catalog. If it‚Äôs not in the Audible free catalog, check Spotify Premium listening, which is 15 hours per month. If you listen to short books on Spotify, you can get 2-3 books in 15 hours. (It‚Äôs 15 book hours, not listening hours.) Also, if your phone is locked, you can go beyond the 15 hours (don‚Äôt report this‚Ä¶). But once you re open the app the 15 hour limit will halt you. 2-3 books would otherwise be $20-45 dollars depending on the cost of the audio book. $12 for Spotify premium is a deal.\nUse Audible credits for books you can‚Äôt find on Libby or Spotify. Remember, Audible is $15 per month. So don‚Äôt waste it on a $4 book. Buy the expensive books or &gt;15 hour books with the credits.\nWith all the cash savings, and if you still have time, now you can buy the remaining books you want on either Audible and Spotify.\n\nMost books are on Libby. Domain specific books and cutting edge releases books are on Audible. Lots of great in between books on Spotify Premium.\nI don‚Äôt know why but after 50 books you get a sense for what books are going to be available where.\nLastly, on Chrome I use the SwiftRead extension for speed reading and on iOS the Outread app.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Configuring an ML pipeline means you have 15 different things that could change at any time and you create a way to easily change those 15 things. Those 15 things could be file paths, data filtering steps, models you want to use, etc.\nAny researcher constantly asks themselves: but what if I switch X parameter? What would happen?\nAnd so the researcher starts to configure a pipeline.\n\nConfig Methods I‚Äôve Used\nFirst time I built a config it was in VBA. I had a text file I loaded in that could be overwritten based on a setting someone chose.\nSecond time I config‚Äôd something was in Python. I used ConfigParser, a Python standard library class. It was pretty good for 2017. But unwieldy. Don‚Äôt use this. It had cool string substitutions but there are better tools now.\nThird thing I saw was using a Python constants.py file. Just import Python variables from another module. This is nice because you can import model objects or such. Dicts. Whatever. Seems great. But it‚Äôs Python code. Config files probably shouldn‚Äôt be code. They should be configs. Configs are easy to read for non-tech folks. They have no dependencies. They‚Äôre just plain text files. Every great software follows this, like k8s helm charts or whatever. Google loves using Protobufs. Configs shouldn‚Äôt be code, because if they‚Äôre code they‚Äôre dangerous. You start doing crazy things with them.\nFourth thing I did was to use YAML which is very clean. Lots of people like YAML. This gets unwieldy if you need 100 configs for different customers, for example. Can you imagine managing 100 yaml files? What if you need to update one param? Then you need to update 100 files. Rough. So then you start setting ‚Äúdefault‚Äù blocks and settings.\nA nice pairing was to use Pydantic to read in the YAML file and validate types. You‚Äôve got to validate types. What‚Äôs an int vs a string? Using pydantic means that we needed to design the pipeline to rely on some config class on the top level. My suggestion would be to design functions to take in arguments that are satisfied by the config, and don‚Äôt pass the config object itself into the function. The former keeps your code cleaner and more testable. The latter sends you down a chaotic slippery slope.\nFifth thing was to use one default YAML. This solved the issue of redundancy across all the 100 YAML files. (If you only have one model, you probably need only 1 YAML file so this may not be your problem.) But this still kinda stinks. It‚Äôs in a file.\nSixth thing was some eng‚Äôs on my team saw a better way and build a CRUD database. This made it so we didn‚Äôt have to do a code change to update a config. That means that people outside the team could edit a config. Awesome. But we still have 100 web pages that could change. Kinda sux. And we still had a default setting - essential. Benefits of a crud are migrations. You can get rid of one option across 100 configs more easily.\nProblem with 100 YAML or 100 web pages is that if you want to change things or run experiments, you need to literally clone the config file. Now you have 15 versions of the same config file with slight modifications and you can‚Äôt remember what‚Äôs going on. So you delete them all eventually and just pick one.\nSeventh thing: shove everything into environment variables. Create a .env file and load with dotenv() but that gets messy because env files don‚Äôt support data type validation. Validation is essential, lest you try to encode a Boolean in your env file only to realize environment variables only support strings and then you have a ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù rendering as true in your ‚Äúif os.get(MY_BOOL)‚Äù call just because it exists as a valid string. Blech‚Ä¶ ü§Æ\n\n\nHydra?\nI‚Äôve been using Hydra lately and I see a lot of benefits in that it solves a lot of the things I‚Äôve tried and seen solved above.\n\n\n\nHydra!\n\n\nHydra | Hydra\n\nHydra is Python open source maintained by Facebook\nIf built to configure pipelines, in particular ML pipelines but could be used for anything that needs config files.\nIt uses dataclasses, which ensures the typing of your files\nIt uses yaml files as the config sources\nYou can specify default config values\nIt quickly allows you to override config files from the command line or from editing the yaml file directly.\nIt‚Äôs possible to run from the command line a single config with several different values using the multirun flag.\nIt gives a nice way to organize your output folder and automatically exports the fully qualified config there.\nIt will capture your logs into your output directory.\nYou can version your configs very easily.\n\nThis demo is slick:\n\n\n\nWhy I like Hydra‚Äôs design\n\nThis seems really nice because it avoids the headache of changing code.\nAlso, you can create a simple bash loop to execute 5 different experiments - while retaining only one config file. Or you can just use the multirun flag to cross a few arguments easily. It‚Äôll create separate output folders for each run.\nHydra maintains a system of record for every run. You know exactly how that run was generated given the parameters fed into it.\n\n\n\nMy Ideal World\nHydra makes it incredibly easy to kick off a bunch of runs without managing multiple configurations or hard-coding constants into a Python file.\nIt enables you to have parameters outside of your code. This makes experimentation very easy.\nIt does not make it easy for non-developers to edit the config - so you‚Äôd still want a GUI to enable that that translates into yaml files. This isn‚Äô\nIt‚Äôs lightweight - all it does is create a config class that you then pass into your pipeline to control the pipeline. That pipeline could be airflow or whatever.\nIt may be nice to pair hydra with metaflow or flyte.\nHow do you configure? # Appendix\n\nEasy Hyperparameter Management with Hydra, MLflow, and Optuna | by NT | Optuna | Medium\nWhy you should log with Aimstack\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I haven‚Äôt used ibis as of writing this. Just reviewed the docs.\n\n\nData Manipulation in Python\nI‚Äôve been a Python data scientist for 5-6 years. I‚Äôve never liked pandas. Ever.\nIt‚Äôs because I started as a tidyverse data scientist in R. One of the things I‚Äôve missed about using Python is dplyr, an R package for data manipulation. And when I started with Python it was in PySpark - it felt very similar to dplyr, except for the annoying JVM.\nIt‚Äôs amazing because everything is done by chaining, and it‚Äôs able to manipulate in memory or translate to a spark or SQL backend for execution. (It‚Äôs very easy to use base dplyr and then just run the same query in memory on a small dataframe or against BigQuery or something.)\nThis chaining also avoids the common readability problem with pandas wherein often you see df[x] = df[y] / df[b] on one line and that‚Äôs repeated for multiple lines if you want to create multiple new variables.\nWhile pandas has the .pipe and .assign operators for chaining, they still require lambda functions, which get annoying. This Reddit thread explores the opinion I share: the api is inconsistent. Reddit - Does anyone else hate pandas?.\nPolars makes this much cleaner with the with_columns operator, for example, which is also very similar to PySpark. But polars is Rust backend, not Java. Game, Set, Match polars.\nI‚Äôm not the only one who loves dplyr . There have been several Python attempts to build dplyr in the Python ecosystem. There were great packages like GitHub - coursera/pandas-ply: functional data manipulation for pandas (9 years since last commit), and GitHub - dodger487/dplython: dplyr for python, not updated in 7 years. Then there‚Äôs the dfply package that hasn‚Äôt been maintained in 5 years (see tutorial).\nThe siuba package is the latest Python dplyr incantation that is actively maintained: GitHub - machow/siuba: Python library for using dplyr like syntax with pandas and SQL and can also execute against a SQL backend, but it can‚Äôt execute a polars backend. # Ibis to solve my problems?\nI just came across ibis however, and it seems really promising. Turns out it was created in 2015 by Wes McKinney, who created the pandas pyarrow backend to solve the ‚Äú10 Things I Hate About pandas‚Äù. More on the\n\nIbis\nIbis ‚Äì getting_started\nIbis ‚Äì Analysis of World of Warcraft data\n\n\nIt looks like dplyr (for example it even copies some syntax like mutate() for adding new columns and select for picking columns). But, the benefit is it has polars and pandas as backends, but also offers PySpark (should someon need to use databricks as a backend compute engine). And it can also translate into SQL. Sure, polars can do this too: Databases - Polars user guide. But ibis seems more extensive.\nThis means I could have one programming language to execute either polars, SQL, or PySpark, rather than have both polars and SQL or pandas in my pipeline in different places. (Side note: why would I use pandas as a backend though when polars is so fast?)\nI just discovered this over the weekend. Would love your thoughts! I‚Äôm sure there are limitations vs raw polars/pandas that are hidden from my quick overview.\n\n\nAppendix\nThe most annoying thing about pandas is the .transform() operator. I hate it. Just hate it. It never makes sense and I always have to look it up. This essentially just does a window operation.\nYou don‚Äôt need this until you need to do some type of aggregation within a group. Let‚Äôs assume you want to calculate the fraction of sales attributed to a city within a state. (What fraction of sales in California come from San Francisco, for example.)\nRead the following and consider for yourself what‚Äôs simplest:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'State': ['CA', 'CA', 'CA', 'NY', 'NY', 'NY'],\n    'City': ['SF', 'LA', 'SF', 'NYC', 'Buffalo', 'NYC'],\n    'Sales': [100, 200, 150, 300, 100, 200]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state\ndf['Fraction'] = df.groupby('State')['Sales'].apply(lambda x: x / x.sum())\n\nprint(df)\nPolars:\nimport polars as pl\n\ndf = pl.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state\ndf = df.with_column(\n  pl.col('Sales') / df.groupby('State').agg(pl.sum('Sales'))['sum'])\n\nprint(df)\nDplyr:\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state\ndf &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(State) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Fraction = Sales / sum(Sales))\nIbis:\nimport ibis\n\n# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state\nexpr = sales.mutate(Fraction=sales['Sales'] / sales.groupby('State').Sales.sum())\n\nresult = expr.execute()\nprint(result)\nIt may not look all that different, but pandas has this weird syntax where you group by (something) but then select a column with brackets. But sometimes you can use periods to select the column.\nThe polars and ibis implementations seem simple, but overly verbose.\nThen there‚Äôs the dplyr. So elegant and simple. The sum() operator is summing within the group, and the sales/sum(sales) is very easy to read.\nIn pandas I‚Äôm left wondering what is x/x.sum() and why this lambda thing?\nThis is a very simple example, but the more you get into the weeds the more my point becomes obvious.\nThe benefits of dplyr come from when you want to do 10 mutates in one go. It‚Äôs so simple. In pandas that‚Äôs 10 lambda functions with a .assign operator.\nLike, look at pandas trying to do this:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'A': list(range(1, 11)),\n    'B': list(range(11, 21)),\n    'C': list(range(21, 31))\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Using assign to create 10 new columns\ndf = df.assign(\n    # New columns with various transformations\n    A_Squared=lambda x: x['A']**2,\n    B_Squared=lambda x: x['B']**2,\n    C_Squared=lambda x: x['C']**2,\n    A_Cubed=lambda x: x['A']**3,\n    B_Cubed=lambda x: x['B']**3,\n    C_Cubed=lambda x: x['C']**3,\n    A_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['A']),\n    B_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['B']),\n    C_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['C']),\n    A_B=lambda x: x['A'] * x['B']\n)\n\nprint(df)\nNow look at dplyr:\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Sample data\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  A = 1:10,\n  B = 11:20,\n  C = 21:30\n)\n\n# Using mutate to create 10 new columns\ndf &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # New columns with various transformations\n    A_Squared = A^2,\n    B_Squared = B^2,\n    C_Squared = C^2,\n    A_Cubed = A^3,\n    B_Cubed = B^3,\n    C_Cubed = C^3,\n    A_Log = log(A),\n    B_Log = log(B),\n    C_Log = log(C),\n    A_B = A * B\n  )\n\nprint(df)\nNow let‚Äôs complicate it, where each manipulation takes in a previous column:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})\n\n# Mutate operations\ndf['B'] = df['A'] ** 2\ndf['C'] = df['A'] + df['B'] * 2\ndf['D'] = df['B'] / 2\ndf['E'] = df['C'] - df['A']\ndf['F'] = df['A'] * 5\ndf['G'] = df['D'] - df['E']\ndf['H'] = df['F'] + df['G']\ndf['I'] = df['D'] ** 2\ndf['J'] = df['H'] / df['I']\ndf['K'] = df['I'] - df['J']\n\nprint(df)\nThis is how most people write pandas. They write df 26 times.\nLet‚Äôs look at pandas using the assign operator:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})\n\n# Mutate operations with assign and lambda functions\ndf = df.assign(\n    B=lambda x: x['A'] ** 2,\n    C=lambda x: x['A'] + x['B'] * 2,\n    D=lambda x: x['B'] / 2,\n    E=lambda x: x['C'] - x['A'],\n    F=lambda x: x['A'] * 5,\n    G=lambda x: x['D'] - x['E'],\n    H=lambda x: x['F'] + x['G'],\n    I=lambda x: x['D'] ** 2,\n    J=lambda x: x['H'] / x['I'],\n    K=lambda x: x['I'] - x['J']\n)\n\nprint(df)\nSlightly better but still an eyesore. 10 lambda statements and still 26 x calls.\nAnd in R:\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create a tibble\ndf &lt;- tibble(A = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))\n\n# Mutate operations\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(B = A ^ 2,\n         C = A + B * 2,\n         D = B / 2,\n         E = C - A,\n         F = A * 5,\n         G = D - E,\n         H = F + G,\n         I = D ^ 2,\n         J = H / I,\n         K = I - J)\n\nprint(df)\nIt‚Äôs just so simple. So elegant. So beautiful. No wasted text. Very easy to read.\nIbis seems similar to dplyr but requires the D = _.[\"B\"]/2 operation. Ibis ‚Äì basics - mutating columns\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

This isn‚Äôt anything new.\nAnd putting aside beliefs about the war itself, I see the angle here as somewhat inauthentic. It assumes tech is somehow awful.\nArms dealers will always be in the race for selling more arms, whether in peace or in war. But providing services at a discounted rate to defend an invaded ally seems reasonable.\nMy point: I wish we had more positive tech news. Tech is how we won WWII and almost how we lost it. That same awful WWII tech is how we now power homes with cleaner energy across the world. Some argue it‚Äôs how we‚Äôve avoided a WWIII so far because it‚Äôs a nuclear war is an unwinnable war.\nTech cannot control the hearts of the men and women who wield it. It can only enable them. May we all strive for wars of words and code not wars of people or weapons, and I actually think tech helps enable that. And hopefully, we can use tech to facilitate misunderstandings and bring people to better diplomacy, ending the need for war. But that‚Äôs up to the leaders. Desires for war rage within hearts long before those desires rage within bullets.\nAs for the main stream media, I‚Äôd hope for more nuanced discussions around the uses of tech. Perhaps that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs alluding to - that war mongers are being fueled by this war.\nBut then let‚Äôs get more diplomatic leaders into office that can manage peace talks. It‚Äôs a people problem. Our government shouldn‚Äôt be run by the war machine, but by the people. And tech will always enable the people to do what they do best: be human.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

This meant that either could help save me.\nI was invited to let go of my first belay. Yes. Let go.\nThis meant I‚Äôd drop 150-200 feet in a free fall.

It was insane and it took all of half a second.\nBut then something unexpected happened: the first belay rope wrapped around my right leg. I turned upside down and instead of the belay stopping me, the burning of rope wrapped around my leg halted my descent. Didn‚Äôt feel good.\nI‚Äôm grateful I didn‚Äôt die that day.

We celebrate His life.\nMost people show up to a funeral dressed in black. But he resurrected in white. And in the temple, we dress in white as He was resurrected.\n # Scriptures\n\nFor ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God‚Äôs. 1 Corinthians 6.20\n\n\nLift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and am your advocate with the Father; and it is his good will to give you the kingdom. Doctrine and Covenants 29.5\n\n\nListen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him‚Äî 4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified; 5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life. Doctrine and Covenants 45.3‚Äì5\n\n\n\nMeaning\nOne distinction between a funeral and a sacrament memorial service is that usually at a funeral you don‚Äôt focus on how they died. It‚Äôs too painful, especially if the death was unanticipated.\nBut at a sacrament meeting we take His bread, broken to symbolize the broken body. And we drink the water, to symbolize the blood that he shed in the garden, that he spilled on the cross under a crown of thorns and a litany of nails.\nWhy is this important? Because His life would have no value if He didn‚Äôt die for us. And he died for us. And how he died is relevant because it‚Äôs the price He paid for us. And knowing we‚Äôve been bought with a price matters because it means we‚Äôre bound to him.\nRemembering His death and how He died reminds me that I want to live like He did.\nHe didn‚Äôt just die. How He died is everything. He died bleeding for us. He died with His last breath for us, instead of for Him. He didn‚Äôt just accept His place on the cross, He exchanged His physical life for our eternal lives. Barabbas was freed in exchange for Him, and we are Barabbas. We are the wicked sinners freed as He went guiltless to the execution. Can you imagine His disciples sitting in the chanting crowd and thinking: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre releasing the wrong man! One convicted for his crimes, the other convicted by those who hate their Messiah!‚Äù Yet they didn‚Äôt know that they‚Äôre as far from God in some ways as Barabbas is‚Ä¶\nAnd despite all the pain we put Him through, He is our Advocate.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "Today at church someone was confirmed a member of the Church after having been baptized yesterday. This taught me something new about the sacrament and the covenant we make with Him every week.\n\n\n\nReceive the Holy Ghost\n\n\n\nEntry into His Church by Baptism\nAfter baptism, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nBut now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt baptize by water, and they shall receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even as the apostles of old. Doctrine and Covenants 35.6\n\nThere is precedence for this, as the Savior gave the gift of the Holy Ghost to his apostles after he was no longer tarrying with them:\n\nAnd when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: John 20.22\n\nPausing on that thought for a moment, let‚Äôs consider the last sentence in the sacrament prayer on the bread:\n\nthat they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 4.3\n\nAlso consider that the last of the water prayer omits that word ‚Äúalways‚Äù:\n\nthat they may have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 5.2\n\nAre they contradictory? No.¬†Because the full last sentence of the water prayer says:\n\nthat they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 5.2\n\nThis tells us that if we always remember him (the Savior), we‚Äôll have His spirit to be with us.\nBack to the New Teatament. The Lord taught His disciples that the comforter would come to them once He left:\n\nNevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. John 16.7\n\nAnd in a prior chapter, Jesus had instructed that this was the plan - that he would give them the gift of the Comforter when He was gone. Notice the word ‚Äúanother‚Äù:\n\nAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. John 14.16‚Äì18\n\nPerhaps He said ‚Äúanother‚Äù Comforter because He is the first?\nHe further promised the role of the Holy Ghost is to teach of truth and testify of the Savior:\n\nBut when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: John 15.26\n\nThe Lord also explained how He works with the Holy Ghost. It appears that, because the Savior was with them, He was their source of truth. But as He was planning to leave them He needed to leave them with a source of truth. As such, they were being prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nThese things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. John 14.25‚Äì26\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt have the spirit - how else could Peter have received His spiritual witness of the Savior? matthew-16.15-17\nWhat do these scriptures all teach me?\n\nIf we always remember the Savior, we‚Äôll have His spirit to be with us\nHis spirit teaches us what is truth: it testifies of Christ\nHe gave this gift because we can‚Äôt always be in His presence.\nEven if we were in His presence, we‚Äôd need the spirit to let us know that He is the Christ\nWhen we receive the Holy Ghost after baptism, we are commanded to ‚Äúreceive the Holy Ghost‚Äù by confirmation into the church.\n\n\n\nWhat is the ‚Äúgift‚Äù of the Holy Ghost?\nThis last one is powerful, because of a clarifying point in the handbook of the church:\n\n\nStates ‚Äúreceive the Holy Ghost‚Äù (not ‚Äúreceive the gift of the Holy Ghost‚Äù).\n18. Performing Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings\n\n\nOr, the ‚Äúgift‚Äù of the Holy Ghost perhaps isn‚Äôt a thing like the priesthood - something bestowed upon us. (This is something I‚Äôve thought it was my whole life - a gift I receive.) why aren‚Äôt we told to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?\nWhat, then, is legally binding about the Lord‚Äôs covenant? And what is the ‚Äúgift of the Holy Ghost‚Äù as mentioned in the scriptures? (Articles of Faith 1.4, Moses 5.58, Jacob 6.8, Doctrine and Covenants 39.23, Doctrine and Covenants 49.14, Acts 10.45, and like 4 other references‚Ä¶it‚Äôs referenced in every standard work!)\nEven the Lord says he‚Äôll bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nAnd whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them. Doctrine and Covenants 33.15\n\nBecause we don‚Äôt ‚Äúreceive the gift of the Holy Ghost‚Äù, perhaps the gift of the Holy Ghost is instead the promised blessing of the constant companionship as a result of keeping our covenant. Things consistent with the definitions in the Guide to the Scriptures:\n\nIt is the right of every worthy baptized member of the Church to have the constant influence of the Holy Ghost. Following a person‚Äôs baptism into the true Church of Jesus Christ, he receives the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands from one who has the proper authority Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nAnyone on earth can enjoy the Holy Ghost. It teaches those of truth. But only those of the covenant of baptism, who keep that covenant and the Sacrament Covenant (To always remember Him, keep His commandments, and take His name upon us), are blessed always with His spirit. Things the gift of the Holy Ghost: its constant companionship.\n\nWhile someone is being confirmed a member of the Church, he or she is told to ‚Äúreceive the Holy Ghost.‚Äù The gift of the Holy Ghost is not forced on anyone. It becomes the responsibility of members to invite the Holy Ghost to be with them Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nAnd perhaps the ordinance of the confirmation is to start that covenant: ‚Äúreceive the Holy Ghost now, and always as you remember Me.‚Äù\nAnd why do we always want His spirit to be with us? Because the spirit is a proxy for Him: the Comforter, the Source of Truth, the Light and Life of the World. When we have that spirit, we are of the Kingdom of Heaven (on earth).\nSo when I take the sacrament every week, I‚Äôm making the covenant to always remember Him so that I can enjoy the gift of receiving the Holy Ghost always.\n\nWhy is this relevant to me personally?\n\nthe gift isn‚Äôt some separate power that I can offend or please. It‚Äôs not some separate God. Instead, the gift is a covenant. This changes my focus away from a relationship with the Holy Ghost and instead a relationship with the Savior. The purpose of the holy ghost is to point me to the Savior. And if I‚Äôm not feeling the spirit, it‚Äôs not about trying to please the Holy Ghost - I just need to begin remembering the savior in that moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "Symbol\nWe break bread, but His bones were not broken. Only His flesh.\n\n\n\nBread to be broken\n\n\n\n\nScriptures\nWhenever we break the bread, I‚Äôm reminded of many things. But one that sticks out is that Christ‚Äôs legs were commanded to be broken by the Roman leaders:\n\nThe Jewish officials, who had not hesitated to slay their Lord, were horrified at the thought of men left hanging on crosses on such a day, for thereby the land would be defiled; so these scrupulous rulers went to Pilate and begged that Jesus and the two malefactors be summarily dispatched by the brutal Roman method of breaking their legs, the shock of which violent treatment had been found to be promptly fatal to the crucified. Jesus the Christ. Chapter 35. Death and Burial\n\nIt was a technique practiced by the Romans to hasten the death of the crucified:\n\nVictims in the head up position could spend several days on the cross before they died. One technique used by the Romans to hasten death was to break the legs below the knee with a blunt instrument1 (p.¬†25) Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion - PMC\n\nA bit graphic, but how did this technique possibly accelerate the death?\n\nAccording to those who have studied the grim mechanics of crucifixion, in order to breathe adequately, the crucified victim periodically had to push himself up using his legs. Breaking the legs prevented him from doing that, thus hastening his death. He would suffocate. Why are the crucified persons‚Äô legs broken?\n\nBut Christ‚Äôs legs were not broken as instructed. Continuing the quote above from Jesus the Christ:\n\n‚Ä¶The governor gave his consent, and the soldiers broke the limbs of the two thieves with cudgels. Jesus, however, was found to be already dead, so they broke not His bones. Christ, the great Passover sacrifice, of whom all altar victims had been but suggestive prototypes, died through violence yet without a bone of His body being broken, as was a prescribed condition of the slain paschal lambs. Jesus the Christ. Chapter 35. Death and Burial\n\nWhy? Why weren‚Äôt the bones broken? Why is this significant?\nThe bones of a paschal lamb were meant not to be broken.\nIt dates back to the Mosiac Passover in Egypt (when the firstborns of the Egyptians and the Pharaoh were killed)\n\nIn one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. Exodus 12.46\n\n\nThey shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. Numbers 9.12\n\nIt was prophesied that ‚ÄúMany are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.‚Äù (Psalm 34.19‚Äì20)\nJohn testified of the fulfillment of this prophecy:\n\nThe Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: John 19.31‚Äì33\n\n\n36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. John 19.36\n\nSo while we break the bread, His bones were not broken. Just His flesh.\n\n\nMeaning\nThe details that were fulfilled at His death remind me of His prophetic life. The fact that he was killed according to the law, and the law predated him and is scripture in the Torah, is further evidence that Christ truly lived and that his life was a fulfillment of prophecy.\nLikewise, those same details apply to my life. He is involved in those details.

    "text": "Today I noticed the wooden beams supporting the roof of my chapel building.\nChrist is our foundation. He‚Äôs our rock. But he also carried the cross up the hill. People looked up to him in His last moments.\nLikewise this beam above me can represent His ascension above the cross. It can also remind me to take up His cross.\n\n\n\nWooden beams\n\n\n\n24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. 26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Matthew 16.24‚Äì26\n\nThe irony of the cross is that He was the Law, the one who gave Moses the book of Deuteronomy. And he was sentenced to death by the same law he gave to the Israelites:\n\nAnd if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 23 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. Deuteronomy 21.22‚Äì23\n\nThe irony is that while he fulfilled the law of Moses, he was condemned according to it.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

The bread is offered to everyone, the way His life was.\nLikewise, his life was freely given. Free. He had control. And He gives the sacrament freely to all who see it.\n\n\nScriptures\nAll are invited to participate in the sacrament, which is symbolic of the life He freely gave. All souls in the chapel are invited to partake of His goodness.\nOnly He could give up His life:\n\nA natural effect of His immortal origin, as the earth-born Son of an immortal Sire, was that He was immune to death except as He surrendered thereto. The life of Jesus the Christ could not be taken save as He willed and allowed. The power to lay down His life was inherent in Himself, as was the power to take up His slain body in an immortalized state. Chapter 25. Jesus Again in Jerusalem\n\nChrist alone was given power by God to control the fate of his otherwise immortal body:\n\nTherefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. John 10.17‚Äì18\n\nBy similar rite, all are welcome. He is in control.\n\nAnd behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not; 3 Nephi 18.22\n\n\n\nMeaning\nBecause Christ had a choice, and not the Romans, over the timing of His death, and He chose to be taken in captivity, and He chose to walk up the hill, the Lord showed he did all that He could to offer Himself to us.\nWhen I pray, I‚Äôm not praying to an unknown God. I‚Äôm praying to one who fully understands me (Porous Bread).\nWhen I pray, I can remember He‚Äôs already done His part. The only thing holding me back from feeling His love is me.\nHow can I pray in such a way to lower those barriers that I put up between Him and me ?\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "Symbol\nWe show up to take the sacrament in our Sunday best. There were many ‚Äúsinners‚Äù who came and adored the Lord. A lady gave him oil and washed His feet. The widow gave two mites. The publicans prayed for forgiveness while the Pharisees judged them.\nWe give Him our best when we show up, as sinners, to offer Him a broken heart and contrite spirit.\n\n\n\nSunday best dress\n\n\n\n\nScriptures\n\nAnd one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee‚Äôs house, and sat down to meat. 37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee‚Äôs house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Luke 7.36‚Äì38\n\nThe Pharisees didn‚Äôt like that she was a sinner.\n\nNow when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. Luke 7.39\n\nWe are redeemed by Him when we come with such a spirit as this woman.\n\nBehold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered. 2 Nephi 2.7\n\n\n\nMeaning\nThe sacrament isn‚Äôt for those who are perfect. It‚Äôs for me, a sinner. One who sins. And is sinning and doesn‚Äôt even know it. One who is separated from the happiness God would have me fully feel because of my ignorance, my natural state. I am good. I am loved. When I pray, He already knows I‚Äôm a sinner and loves me regardless. He doesn‚Äôt want me to see myself as a sinner, but as a worshipper who has much to grow from. And I am growing.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Greg has graciously allowed us to build on his work with a repository that is now OSS.@natfriedman We have a much more rigorous test we‚Äôve put out based on this idea.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/i5O8zrcwQT\n\n‚Äî Aparna Dhinakaran (@aparnadhinak) December 15, 2023\n\n\nThis is a powerful analysis. Sure, Anthropic will find a way to improve or challenge the results. But the point is clear: these technologies can remember hyper specific 7-digit random numbers out of a batch of 126,000 tokens, where a token is roughly 4 characters. GPT is clear winner here, too.\nAlso, open source is getting incredibly good. This implies the future is open source.\n\n\nComparing @OpenAI #GPT4 Turbo to @MistralAI GPT-4 is pretty good in that region in general. Interesting to see how @MistralAI scales to larger context windows pic.twitter.com/WQo6MmGIHh\n\n‚Äî Aparna Dhinakaran (@aparnadhinak) December 15, 2023\n\n\n\n\nImpact\nRAG can be used to make retrieval more efficient. But if retrieval is already super efficient maybe RAG is only a short term thing. Context lengths of 10m tokens‚Ä¶probably by next year right?\nStart of the year we were at 4K tokens. Now there are 126,000 tokens. 30x improvement. So to do another 30x improvement is 3.76M. So yea, by next year you should be able to just load the entire RAG database into memory. But‚Ä¶gonna be super expensive.\nPoint is: would GPT be this effective if it was using RAG over a database? Or is it more effective loading it all into context?\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Eventually, the product took shape and we had a successful kickstarter launch.\nSince that time, I‚Äôve thought about how valuable it was to get information straight from the source.\nAlberto Savoia‚Äôs new book, ‚ÄúThe Right It‚Äù, is re-teaching me this principle. Data beats opinions, he says. In another book I‚Äôm reading, ‚ÄúTrustworthy Online Controlled Experiments‚Äù, the former CEO of Netscape is quoted saying,\n\nIf we have data, let‚Äôs go with data. If all we have are opinions, let‚Äôs go with mine. - Jim Barksdale\n\nData sourced from your manager, your stakeholder, or your customer are invaluable to help you know if you‚Äôre solving their problem. Too often it‚Äôs easy to get stuck in the original solution that comes to our mind.\nData from customers directly shape the product. Data sourced at scale from online experiments refine it.\nOpinions from the customer shape the product. Their behavior (captured as data) speaks louder than their words. Frequently, it‚Äôs challenging to correlate the two. We‚Äôre left to guess why someone actually clicked, bought, churned. It‚Äôs a beautiful cycle.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you become a public opinion person (author, speaker, podcaster), you‚Äôre inherently inviting publicity bias.\nA message is like a product. If it‚Äôs not well received, either through attention, clicks, or books purchased, then most people may abandon the idea. Very few (those seeking truth), are staunch advocates of an opinion not popularly received.\nEven unpopular opinion people try out their ideas. They may rise on social media as ‚Äúthey want to cancel me, so trust my opinion‚Äù. That sales pitch only lasts so long as you‚Äôre a minority.\nPoint is: if your opinion gets reception, you‚Äôre less likely to change your opinion. This is a problem in politics for people who espouse something for a long time.\nInstead we should be like Galileo: show me the data.\nSo be cautious if people like your opinion because you may be at risk of not being able to change it, either through your own evolving greed or desire for social acceptance and popularity.\nThe reception of an idea doesn‚Äôt determine its truthfulness, but the ability of the idea to stand on its own.\n\n\n\nLook for the evidence, not the popularity\n\n\nI always try to think about this when listening to a popular author or podcaster: what about their idea has garnered popularity? Have they changed course in the face of evidence? I recall Amy Cuddy having one of the most popular Ted talks on Power Poses, only to have a Slate article come out that refused her research. She doubled down despite her research not being reproducible: the gold standard a scientist should seek.\nFew people are like Amy Cuddy in that their ideas cannot be easily tested and so the world lazily believes them. This is the risk: when people stop thinking for themselves.\nThings why Frank Herbert wrote Dune: to encourage people to think for themselves and not put too much trust in their leaders.\n\n2024-01-17 update:\nChapter 14 of The Quest for Cosmic Justice discusses this way better than I do here.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

It‚Äôs amazing how I feel so new to it all despite raising two kids in the last five years. In starting fresh a third time I feel inspired to write down some things I‚Äôm rediscovering.\nTo anyone getting started on their baby journey, perhaps these suggestions can help. Your baby is definitely different than mine, so your mileage may vary! But since I‚Äôm still using this stuff five years later maybe it can help you too. Either way, congrats and good luck!\n\nProducts I still use on baby 3\nSince I‚Äôm a mega influencer (on my very established data science blog here), I get paid $500 every time you click a link below. So please, go crazy.\nI‚Äôll also credit my wife for figuring out to buy these products in the first place.\n\nStretchy swaddle, like this. I like stretchy swaddles because they‚Äôre forgiving. The cotton muslin swaddles are nice and soft, but if the fabric doesn‚Äôt stretch the right way you may have to redo the swaddle.\nOllie swaddle (nighttime). This thing is ridiculously overpriced for a swaddle. $70? Don‚Äôt get it. But if you do, I like it because its super easy to put on and very sturdy (hard for baby to break). At month 2 the baby gets strong and the basic swaddles are so easy to break. That and I feel like I‚Äôm gonna hurt my kid if I try to make a cotton swaddle unbreakable. Enter Velcro! I can be gentle on the swaddle but have it be unbreakable. There are a lot of random contraption swaddles that tie the baby up like a pretzel. This is your classic burrito. Insert baby, wrap right side, Velcro left side and you‚Äôre done.\nUbbi Steel Odor Locking diaperpail. I also hated the thought five years ago of shelling out $70 for a trash can. Five years since and the thing still performs. I know how well it‚Äôs working when garbage day rolls around and I open it to change it. Smells like a gentle coastal breeze, maybe. To this day my wife hasn‚Äôt changed it more than a time or two because thankfully I have an iron stomach and unfortunately she does not. Point is: it keeps the diaper smell inside (for the most part) and uses normal garbage bags (cost saver).\nBaby K‚Äôtan Original Baby Wrap Carrier, Infant and Child Sling. I‚Äôve tried several carriers. Boba wraps take way too much patience to learn how to put on (patience I ran out of quickly as a new dad). This thing is just two circular fabric swaths, which means it takes two seconds to throw on. The convenience is huge - baby crying? Grab the carrier and snuggle up in 10 seconds or less.\nDockATot Deluxe+ Dock. We just got one off Facebook marketplace for $50 for third kid. We got it because let‚Äôs be real - sleeping is hard. The hardest thing about sleeping is the uncertainty what‚Äôs happening on the other side of the room in the crib. Grunting. Coughing. Is baby waking up? Needs a pacifier? When it‚Äôs 5am and you‚Äôre on feeding three of the night, being able to just roll over and plop the little one into the co-sleeper and monitor the situation close up is nice.\n4moms rockaRoo Baby Swing. There are a thousand ways to solve the ‚Äúwhere do I put my baby while cooking dinner‚Äù problem. We‚Äôve liked this one.\n\n\n\nMust Haves\n\nDish soap. Honestly, nothing gets out a blowout stain like dish soap. That and drying in the sun is a miracle worker. (Apparently this is how cloth diaper people do it.)\nApple cider vinegar for diaper rash. Once the little pimples appear, you‚Äôll try anything to get them to go away. We just discovered this hack recently and I was delightfully surprised how easily it worked.\nThis is the right way to carry a car seat. A friend of mine that has three kids didn‚Äôt know this was a thing until he saw me do it. It‚Äôs a thing. Do it! Your forearm will thank you.\n\n\n\nToddler Time\nDown the road, these products have hit home runs for me.\n\nMunchkin Miracle 360 Trainer Cup. Every time I put this cup together I consider applying to Munchkin for a job to be their sales rep. This company has very clever designs on their products and this one just crushes it for me. Acts like a normal cup. Performs like a sippy. (I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve taken a few swigs out of this just to understand how it works!)\nContigo Spill-Proof Kids Tumbler. I think we have 80 water bottles in a junk drawer somewhere. Cheap ones. Expensive ones. They all end up scattered in pieces like the zebra herd before the lion that is your innocent child. This cup is no exception: I‚Äôve lost a straw on one already. But! If you want a water bottle you‚Äôll have the problem of spare parts. (Uhh, this isn‚Äôt a recommendation so far‚Ä¶) So why this cup? This cup is just good. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs easy to assemble and clean (wide top). Doesn‚Äôt spill. Kids like straws?\n\n\n\nBooks\nNot that you‚Äôll have time to read‚Ä¶\n\nThe Happiest Baby on the Block; Fully Revised and Updated Second Edition: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a quick YouTube video showing the 5 ways to sooth a baby. (Here‚Äôs an article.) But if you like books this is a good one. TLDR: sucking, swaddle, shushing, swinging, and side are all soothing to a crying baby.\n1-2-3 Magic: Gentle 3-Step Child & Toddler Discipline for Calm, Effective, and Happy Parenting. This is for toddlers, but I‚Äôve learned this technique has been very helpful for giving me sanity in the terrible two phase. The approach doesn‚Äôt always work, but I‚Äôve learned when it does, which is important. TLDR: don‚Äôt talk (engage in debate) with your toddler or show emotion when they‚Äôre misbehaving. Count them when they do bad acts. That‚Äôs 1. That‚Äôs 2. That‚Äôs 3. Break time. The book explains the method. YouTube is probably a friend here too.\n\n\n\nFinal word\nFatherhood has pushed my limits in all the ways. But I thank God every day I‚Äôm a dad. I do a nightly gratitude journal of my favorite moments of the day. If I‚Äôm paying attention during the day, at night it‚Äôs always my kids that have brought me the happiest moments and greatest joys of the day.\nJust remember: the clothes/products/trips are like the tools used to construct a fine painting. At the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt matter what tools you use. Nobody cares and neither will you. It‚Äôs the output that matters most. I‚Äôve found by just really paying attention to and getting curious about my kids in any moment helps me see the beauty of it all, while distractions cause me to think I need this or that be a better dad.\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

This is what I've learned about resumes: pic.twitter.com/MWuacsClFP\n\n‚Äî Jerry Lee (@JerryJHLee) April 11, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Use the ‚ÄúAccomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]‚Äù format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting resume is painstaking, but let me help jumpstart you. My resume below has gotten me dozens of interviews with top tech companies (Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Waymo, LinkedIn, Hopper, etc).\nIt got me in the door, but let me be clear I didn‚Äôt pass most of those interviews üòù. That‚Äôs the point of the resume: open the door.\nLet me help you get in the door.\n\nMy template\nHere‚Äôs the google doc link to my resume template, also posted below.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1n8W79UBiWYhMWHeF4sNDtwaWxySRwU3t9isodbUuycI/view\nYou can copy this template and put in your own content.\nI designed and wrote my resume the way I did by following the guidance of these resources:¬†\n\nBlog: Google‚Äôs Accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z formula\nYouTube Video: Google‚Äôs How to write a resume\nBlog: Cracking the Coding Interview: how to write a resume\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\nIt takes some practice, but the XYZ formula is very powerful.\nEmboldening words can be helpful to people who have 3 minutes to scan your resume.\nI‚Äôve never gotten commentary on how long my resume is or crammed. I‚Äôm guessing people just glance for a few keywords and some decent content and assume the rest of the resume is good.\nI‚Äôve had a lot of discussions in phone calls about my Personal Projects sections. Fellow techies all have their own personal projects and they want to know about mine. It sends a signal you‚Äôre intrinsically motivated.\nWhile my resume is long-ish, I try to think: what story does this bullet point tell? What story am I trying to convey?\n\n\n\nHow can I Help?\nI hope this helps! Send me a message at bryanwhitingcoaching@gmail.com if I can help review a resume or give more tips.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "The book Dune is amazing in many ways, but the one that piqued my curiosity today was this: what if water was a currency?\nThe book gives great reverence to water, specifically talking about the lengths the Fremen go to to preserve their water. They even harvest it the dead, as water is life. They see people around them as water vessels. If you‚Äôre 100 kg (220lbs), they say you carry 60 kg of water weight. That‚Äôs a 60 liters. If you drink an average of 2 liters per day, that‚Äôs enough water to sustain you for 30 days. Fascinating how you would die without drinking water for a week though, right?\nSome on this earth live with such water scarcity. Most in the US don‚Äôt.

    "text": "Preamble\nIn the spirit of the book Principles, with a goal toward increased productivity through self-awareness and accountability, I cement here a personal constitution. I publish this publicly for all to read that I might benefit from their feedback.\n\n\nFoundational Principles\nImprovement through self awareness. As perhaps Socrates said, ‚Äúan unexamined life is not worth living‚Äù. To add my own twist: an examined life refines what‚Äôs worth living for. Like a chef with a fine palette, a self awareness acquired through reading, personal coaching, cognitive therapy, and above all journaling and hearing yourself talk, refines\nTrust thyself: I can‚Äôt grow unless I test my opinions. ‚ÄúSuccess¬†in life is the¬†result of good judgment.¬†Good judgment¬†is usually the¬†result of experience.¬†Experience¬†is usually the¬†result of bad judgment.‚Äù Tony Robbins Alberto Savoia teaches in The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeeds the YODA framework - Your Own DAta. Only your own data is trustworthy. Intuition gets me to the point of knowing what data I need to collect. After intuition, there‚Äôs my opinion about what might happen, someone else‚Äôs opinion about what might happen, someone else‚Äôs data, and my own data. With limited time and the infeasability of collecting omniscient data (discussed in How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices (Annie Duke)), I want to collect as much data as I can from other people‚Äôs mistakes by reading and learning. My value to the world, however, will come when I recognize that for a problem at hand that there is either data gathered via the Aristotlean methold of empirical evidence or Socratic method of reasoning by degrees. Judgment is used to determine whether data is worth being collected. In absence of data, ‚ÄúIf we have data, let‚Äôs look at data. If all we have are opinions, let‚Äôs go with mine.‚Äù Jim Barksdale, CEO of Netscape (Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing). I will be unafraid to share my opinion, even if perceived as stupid or wrong.\nAssume Kindness, Give Kindness, Give and Seek Forgiveness. In a multi-cultural world, it‚Äôs hard to know what word might offend someone. I learned this by learning ‚ÄúHonduran‚Äù Spanish. The word for ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù in one culture might be a curse word in another. Inadvertantly, if I‚Äôm to share an opinion with the best of intentions, I may offend someone unwittingly due to the way I shared it or the way they interpreted it. Everyone communicates differently. Assume kindness means to assume they don‚Äôt intend harm. Give kindness means to speak with good intention. Giving and seeking forgiveness is the process of recognizing that in assuming or giving kindness, I‚Äôll fall short but I can recover and let things go. Regardless of culture, we‚Äôre all human and want good feelings. We can operate in a way that cultivates these good feelings - a universal language.\nVulnerability is recognizing weakness, which is the foundation of true, enduring strength. As discussed in Dare to Lead and Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team, teams fail when they‚Äôre not vulnerable, vulnerable in the sense that they‚Äôre self aware to share their strengths and weaknesses and ask for help in their weaknesses. A toxic environment is one that fails to recognize weakness, because like a limp knee that causes first hip, then shoulder issues appear. A powerful Christian teaching states, ‚ÄúI¬†give¬†unto men weakness that they may be humble;‚Ä¶for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make¬†weak¬†things become strong unto them.‚Äù (Ether 12:27). From this point of view, weakness is actually a gift. It‚Äôs a gift to rely on God (in my opinion, which is most often found in the goodness and grace of others) and ask for help. The Alcoholics Anonymous group recognizes the power of asking for help.\n\n\nPrincipled Behaviors\nOpinions deserve to be dissected, and everyone is filled with biases. Challenging Opinions: Put out opinions, and challenge others‚Äô: ‚ÄúStrong opinions, loosely held‚Äù is a mantra in tech and means something different to everyone. I interpret this as ‚Äúeveryone has an opinion, most choose to let the most dominant opinion run the conversation‚Äù. ‚Äústrong‚Äù means you recognize you actually do have an opinion, even if you don‚Äôt care. By sharing an opinion, you‚Äôre putting it out there to be challenged. Being willing to change it with new evidence is ‚Äúloosely-held‚Äù. It‚Äôs demonstrated in Elon Musk changing his opinion of how to design Starship while talking to a reporter. Speak, be open to challenges, and adjust. If I don‚Äôt challenge opinions, I‚Äôm at risk of ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù syndrome later, except you didn‚Äôt tell them and instead you inflate your internal ego and did nothing to solve the problem.\nChallenge theory, challenge data collection. As discussed in Scientific Freedom (Donald Braben), peer review is dying and failing the scientific process. As discussed in The Coddling of the American Mind (Jonathan Haidt,¬†Greg Lukianoff), cancel culture is crushing open and free discussion, opinions and movements usually driven by cognitive distortions. As demonstrated in The Quest for Cosmic Justice (Thomas Sowell), there is usually strong contra-evidence to very dogmatic political beliefs about ‚Äúhow things should be‚Äù. If we reason with evidence like Sowell, challenge our beliefs like Haidt/Lukianoff, and seek to establish real, empirical truth like Braben, we‚Äôll approach problems like Duke by considering all possibilitys, evaluating costs, and challenging internal biases. Data collection is difficult, and the procedures by which you collect data and draw conclusiosn from it must be challenged so that inferences can\nIf I have an issue I‚Äôll bring it to the problem first. If I have a conflict (see next section) with someone, I seek to resolve it behind closed doors first. It takes two people to resolve a conflict. If the conflict cannot be resolved behind closed doors, or repeatedly re-occurs despite my best efforts, I‚Äôll proceed to a more defensive stance, which often resolves in me processing it through journaling.\nIf I sense an issue, I seek to reassure those around me. I‚Äôve been in several great organizations, and several toxic organizations. Once, 2 weeks after joining a team I interviewed everyone on the team. I could tell immediately that 6/12 were incredibly dissatisfied even if they didn‚Äôt say it. One of them went so far as to tell me they hated their boss. Within a year, 5/12 had left the team to go somewhere else in the org. On another occassion, I joined a team and within one week of joining, one person asked me to unionize. Again, a lot of discord. Within 6 weeks 10 of the 20 data scientists in the company were fired, including the disgruntled. In a third cirucmstance, a lot of disgruntled employees foment amongst themselves, each trying to solve their problems with management. Management doesn‚Äôt recognize even direct requests for changes in behavior. In all three of these circumstances, I work quickly to bring up the issues. I speak directly with management. I speak in the first person, keeping confidences, and only doing so usually at my own personal risk. I try to resolve what I have experienced, and what I have control over. Sometimes, people don‚Äôt want to change. Usually this results in failed organizations, but not always. In all three of these circumstances, I have witness failed organizations. The first was in a large organization where the manager got a horrible ‚Äúdo not recommend‚Äù rating from their peers. The second was an organization that lost all of its remaining data science talent. The third was an organization that lost multiple long-tenured teammates, even key leaders, that went on to get top jobs at other top companies. Belief: if talent gets a great job at a great company elsewhere, the company is doing something wrong.\n\n\nMy Conflict Style\nConflict, to me, isn‚Äôt a dirty word if two people have good intentions. It becomes dirty when both parties have bad intentions. It‚Äôs at its worst when one has good intentions and the other has bad.\nAs the youngest child of peaceful parents, my conflict style is to observe and self-reflect.\n\n\nHow I‚Äôll Fail\n\nAfter doing a ton of work on myself, I‚Äôve grown to an awareness of how I operate. There are past scars.\n\nI‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm stupid before.\nI‚Äôve been fired before. This leads\nI hyperfocus on the negative.\nI reason by extremes.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Score goals ‚Üí be remembered forever in the annals of high school lore, the thinking goes.\nThis question misses the point.\nIn ‚ÄúEgo is the Enemy‚Äù, Ryan Holiday asks the rhetorical question ‚Äúto be or to do‚Äù. The mindset is that either we can focus on doing great work (spending time on action and education), or we can focus on being great (talking too much, dreaming too much). Ironically, greatness follows those who do, not those who say they will do.\nSo instead of asking ‚Äúhow will others remember me‚Äù, ask ‚Äúwhat will I do for others?‚Äù\n\n\n\nDan Kiefer via Unsplash\n\n\nOn this Christmas season, remember that while Jesus Christ‚Äôs divinity has been debated for centuries, certainly he‚Äôs been remembered. He‚Äôs been remembered because of the actions he took and the kindness he showed.\nChristians believe he was the Son of God, one with literal power over death and rose from his own grave. He could calm the seas and turn water to wine. He was the rightful heir to the throne that his Roman captors sat on. He could have easily freed his oppressed nation to rest on his laurels forever.\nYet the recorded miracles we have from him don‚Äôt involve him showing moving mountains or collecting power and gold. The reason he‚Äôs remembered is because His miracles involve him spending time with individuals and in their service. He healed the sick. Caused the blind to see. He alleviated suffering.\nMay this Christmas be one where you don‚Äôt focus on what others think of you. May it be one where you enjoy following His example of doing good for others, however small.\n\nWhosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

Too many is too confusing.\nKR-Drivers: Identify the key drivers that affect the goal.\nHypothesize: Use data/intuition to guess what will drive increases in KR-drivers.\nExperiment: Try 2 approaches, manipulate the drivers in big or minor ways.\nTrack: Measure/track/Log what‚Äôs needed to measure if your hypothesis was valid or rejected.\nAnalyze: make minor tweaks in the drivers and measure statistically significant changes.\nConclude: Which direction will increase your KR. Consider alternate paths if the experiment didn‚Äôt yield good results.\nPeriodic Evaluation: At a pre-determined cadence (1 wk, 6 wk, quarter), choose if your KR is helping you achieve your objective.¬†\n\nA few lessons learned as a professional experimenter:\n\nTracking is not the key result. Don‚Äôt confuse them. Too many people¬†¬†track habits for no reason (I‚Äôm guilty of this 100%)\nKR‚Äôs have no purpose if you don‚Äôt have an objective. You want 100k ffollowers? 100k revenue? They don‚Äôt mean anything until you know what you‚Äôre going to do with it. More fame/money doesn‚Äôt equal more life satisfaction. Lots of unhappy/depressed rich/famous people.\n‚ÄúExperimentation‚Äù early into defining a product should be massive swings. Find the ‚Äúlowest hanging fruit‚Äù, make the biggest changes.\nHave principles to guide your KR‚Äôs. If you don‚Äôt\nHave Anti-KR‚Äôs - things you won‚Äôt do. This is the hardest. If you have 10 KR‚Äôs, perhaps KR‚Äôs 2-10 should be all anti-KR‚Äôs.

This is my one focus right now.\n\nAnalyze: on day 28, I‚Äôll weigh myself again.¬†\nConclude: Did this 28-day challenge change how I felt? Be honest: it might not. Perhaps I can get on my bike, or hike, or do pushups every day instead.\nPeriodic evaluation: every 2 months I‚Äôll investigate how my energy is.\n\nyour goal isn‚Äôt to gain/lose weight. Your goal is to feel better about your health.

What would having a PhD give you that I don‚Äôt have?\nWell, I trust you more if you had one.\nJeremy Howard, a world renowned research and creator of fast.ai and answers.ai started his lectures on deep learning with ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to have a math degree, you just need to know a little bit of code‚Äù. With that philosophy he‚Äôs helped entrepreneurs create amazing products that left his free online program.\n\nBlindspots tho\nConcepts are important to understand. Understanding your training data and how the machines learn from them and the biases they‚Äôre prone to is very useful, perhaps mission critical, to creating value.\nSo what‚Äôs the line? Well, if you got a PhD you‚Äôd probably spend 80% of your time on your dissertation and taking some non relevant coursework. How does that help you today?\nWell, you should learn as many concepts as you can. Like driving a car, you don‚Äôt need to know hydroplaning but you should learn hydroplaning. You don‚Äôt need to know how to drive in snow but you should know that driving a car in the snow with rear wheel drive is a different experience.\nIf you live in Arizona you don‚Äôt need to know how to drive in the snow. Your bias is you‚Äôll never know why that would be necessary.\n\n\nPrinciple\nBe so curious that you explore the boundaries of your space such that you learn ‚Äúoh, cars work differently in snow, but I don‚Äôt have snow so I‚Äôm safe‚Äù. Once you reach the boundary you probably know enough. Then ship your code and learn by how you messed things up.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "section": "An Example",
    "text": "An Example\nI build data science models by building python packages and committing the code to GitHub. The python package contains all of the support files and a main.py file to run the pipeline from start to finish. The support files could contain either helpful loggers to tell me where the pipeline is breaking down, diagnostic tools such as an AUC-ROC plot, files to engineer features, or files to train different model types. So there are really these three things that could happen to my code at any time. It doesn‚Äôt matter where those changes occur, or how many lines of code changed. What matters is what‚Äôs happened to the model. Each time I get a pull request approved, I‚Äôll update the version number in my repo.\n\nChanging BETWEEN\nIncrement the BETWEEN version for the following changes:\n\nWhen the structure of your data changes\nIf your target variable changes (how you coded it, or data that produced the target changed)\nThe underlying population you‚Äôre training on changes\n\nAssume I discovered that I had a bad join. The join change might have been a minor one, but it‚Äôs now difficult to really compare the two models because my target was affected as a result. What I was predicting, even if slightly different, is now something different. If you ever feel like you‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges when looking at an AUC-ROC curve, update the BETWEEN version.\nWith each BETWEEN change, there should be a clear communication in the release notes of why the model is inherently different from prior models. These changes should be less frequent.\n\n\nChanging WITHIN\nIncrement the WITHIN number when the following happens:\n\nFeatures are added\nData sources are added or updated. (You might have several data sources today that help contribute to the target. But adding a data source might just mean adding new features. If you add data in such a way that it changes what you‚Äôre ultimately modeling, update the BETWEEN version.)\nNew modeling types are added. (You might be using a logistic regression, but add a mo)\n\nSo if I added files that allowed me to train different model types, or added files that engineered new features, I‚Äôd incrememnt the WITHIN version. In my mind, this shouldn‚Äôt be a count of features you include, but should just be incremented every time you do something that affects the model performance.\nAt any time, you might what to view different subsets of features and their effect on the model. So, you might not change the number of features, but add some functionality into your pipeline that now produces three different models in each run. I would increment the WITHIN version number in that case.\nRemember, the goal of this type of versioning is to show generally what‚Äôs changed in your pipeline.\n\n\nChanging PROCESS\nIncrement the PROCESS version when the following happens:\n\nA minor bug is fixed (unless this updates BETWEEN or WITHIN)\nEnhance a logger or aspect of the pipeline\nAdd a diagnostic plot or table\n\nBasically, any time you add something that doesn‚Äôt ultimately affect the performance of the model, you should update the PROCESS version. Your changes might improve the flow of your code and make you a much happier developer, but if it doesn‚Äôt improve the model, then the key priority of your code hasn‚Äôt improved."

    "text": "The Essence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: The future belongs to those whom it‚Äôs always belonged\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blogger data scientist Santiago recently said on Twitter, (paraphrasing) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to focus on what won‚Äôt change‚Äù. He was worried about how coding and AI will be automated, but Jeff Bezos wasn‚Äôt worried about so much of the world changing with the Internet. Bezos focused on what wasn‚Äôt changing.\nThis thought hit me, because I think it‚Äôs relevant to what our future looks like in 18 months.\n\n\nEvery day, a new winner\nNothings more apparent that the world is going to be wildly different than the past than to hop on X and see new academics one upping themselves with the next greatest LLM. Mistral just announced a 2Bn valuation as a 6 month old company. Fast is the new pace. And it‚Äôs oddly the case that big businesses are capable of massive disruption from upstarts. They can‚Äôt afford to stay glacial much longer (5-10 years).\nWith all of this, what about this blog post won‚Äôt change? Well, the timeless principle is that the nature of the game has changed permanently. Pandora‚Äôs box was opened.\n\n\nThe rise of a new equalizer\nGo into a poor part of town and you‚Äôre guaranteed to see one thing: poor people using smart phones.\nThey have access to all the same information that the rich people have. The same excellent software. Same excellent hardware. All for a fee of $50/mo for the hardware and $25/mo for an unlimited data plan.\nSo that out the rich and the poor on the same level.\nWell now, knowledge and reasoning is as accessible as Google Maps. You don‚Äôt have to pay $20/mo for ChatGPT plus. You can use Bing, Claude.ai, bard.google.com, You.com, or perplexity.ai for free. Now.\nSure people hate on bard and want to use the latest and greatest. But even the crappiest of the four I mentioned above (granted Bing/You.com use GPT in the background), is still leaps ahead of where we were just a year ago. If we were stuck only using one of these tools forever we‚Äôd still be massively more productive than not.\nSo knowledge and intellectual reasoning is going to be commonplace amongst the plebes.\n\n\nif you value intelligence above all other human qualities, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time\n\n‚Äî Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) October 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\nMore of the same\nSo‚Ä¶what‚Äôs going to happen? Well, I‚Äôm not sure human nature will change much.\nThey say ‚Äúbeing rich doesn‚Äôt make you happier. It just makes you more of what you already were before being rich‚Äù.\nAnd so, the mentally poor will remain so. They‚Äôll use AI for entertainment. Better video games. Better, faster content. More consumption.\nThe creatives will be more creative. Nobody will be at a barrier of being silo‚Äôd.¬†So what if you‚Äôve only done data science for 10 years. You know coding. It‚Äôs easy to now do web design. Or copy writing. Or art. Or‚Ä¶\nAnd I won‚Äôt be able to stop the masses from using Code Interpreter to do data science. The systems will only become more powerful, so cloud companies will make it easier to write sql or whatever. Heck, 5-10 years English will be the only programming language. (Who here does firmware/bit mapping anymore? Only a select few.)\n\n\nThe hottest new programming language is English\n\n‚Äî Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) January 24, 2023\n\n\nPython programmers will become like the engineers who create the seeds. And the rest of us just get bigger, better, and more efficient farms. There will always be those who specialize, as there are people who write compilers today, but fewer and farther between. Perhaps intellectual interest and economic incentives will equalize.\n\n\nFestivus for the rest of us\nCompanies will become smaller. But the same human needs will need to be met:\n\nfood\nshelter\nclothes\nphysical toys\ndigital entertainment\n\nMore people will just be able to do more things. Perhaps there will be more prosperity as a result.\nAnd more people will unionize and try to prevent the change. But that‚Äôs a short term thing. Can‚Äôt last forever. A union is only as good as it‚Äôs needed.\n\n\nTakeaways\nGet ahead by focusing on what‚Äôs essential. Leverage what‚Äôs around you to develop new skills to prepare for the future. And be excited. It‚Äôs going to be a wild ride.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "There was a moment when I had everything to lose. When I was junior in high school, I was scared I‚Äôd be cut from the lacrosse team. There was only one coach and he didn‚Äôt have space for everybody. Coach held try outs.\nMy dad was traveling the week of try outs. I gave him a call. ‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt make the team?‚Äù\nHe waits till I finish. And in a way characteristic of my Dad, he re-emphasizes the question. ‚ÄúWhat if? You go out there, you play your hardest, you give it your all. The rest is out of your hands. If you get cut, you get cut.‚Äù\nHe didn‚Äôt give me false praise or reassurance. He gave me perspective on life. He gave me ‚Äúnothing to lose.‚Äù\nI never worked harder in my athletics than that week. I just didn‚Äôt want to get cut.\nWell, I passed try outs. So did everyone else because it was just a coaching trick to motivate us‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs beside the point. But my dad‚Äôs advice was never lost on me.\nI had low confidence the whole season. Yet my coach took a surprising interest in me. I got playing time as a junior. I was a part time defender.\nLittle did I know, nor could I ever have imagined as a defender who could barely pass or catch, that in my coach‚Äôs last game, I would be sitting on the wrong side of the field. I would be standing, as a defender, right in front of the opposing team‚Äôs goalie crease. I‚Äôm not quite sure how I got there as the whole season I always sprinted off the field whenever we transitioned from defense to offense.\nMy coach always yelled at me. ‚ÄúStay on the field!! It‚Äôs a fast break!‚Äù But I was always terrified of dropping the ball. I was great at defense. Great at scooping the ball. Great at passing it to an offender. This was my safe place.\nYet here I was, in the final minutes of the game. We had three, they had five. And I‚Äôm on the crease. What was I doing here?\nMy eyes and voice called to my teammate who saw me. My teammate who knew full well I had no intention of actually catching the ball. My teammate who would love to pass it to me if he had any assurance I‚Äôd actually catch it. I could see his eyes lock with mine and it only takes 8 years playing a sport to recognize that split-second glance, ‚ÄúAre you going to actually catch this?‚Äù My eyes asserted in that moment with my stick extended and ready ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know. But I‚Äôm wide open and I‚Äôm on the crease. And you have the defender and not me. So make a call.‚Äù\nTo my surprise he actually passed it. It didn‚Äôt have to be a just perfunctory vanity motion to please the coach. Because I‚Äôve called for the ball many times in that wrote script, ‚Äúoh please pass it I swear it‚Äôs worth all our time okay I did my thing now you guys go score because I‚Äôm outta here!‚Äù\nI catch. I turn. I dunk. 4-5.\nWhat just happened?\nI asked Teddy later why he actually passed it to me. ‚ÄúI figured, what the heck? Maybe he‚Äôll catch it!!‚Äù We both laughed. He had nothing to lose.\nI didn‚Äôt know it then, but it was the last goal anybody would score for my coach. It was the last game of the season. The last game of his 35 year career at our school. I was wholly undeserving.\nAnd that‚Äôs when you stand most to gain.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

It only got me angry.\nThe point of learning something is to take action and create positive change in the world. If I learn about things I don‚Äôt plan to take action on,\nif that sounds uneducated, another reason to learn something is to gain empathy and change my perspective. However, the global news is generally biased by the wars for subscriptions between a handful of editors.\nNiche news is far more educative. I‚Äôve subscribed to blogs, to specific influencers in my field, etc. I‚Äôve learned things from these people that I can apply that day in my job. I‚Äôm subscribing to things that feed my career.\nlong form content is far better way to understand current events. If you want to understand the state of the world, read a book on it. Most major geopolitical events are insanely complicated and cannot be surmised in 126 characters. Read a few books on the things you care about.\nthere‚Äôs so much thought put into even a low quality book. Think about it: most books get reviewed by editors in the very least. They probably get read once or twice at least by the original authors. So what would be a better time for your energy - a low quality book or a set of posts on LinkedIn likely generated by ChatGPT or Jasper.ai? If a low quality book &gt; than a tweet, surely 30 min a day of a high quality book (easy to find) is worth more than most low quality content.\nI broke my iPhone in 2020 and waited 45 days for a replacement. But it wasn‚Äôt fully broken - the screen was hopelessly shattered on the bottom half where typing is required. So I kept it in my drawer and only used it when I needed to. The risk of using it? Getting a shard of glass stuck in my finger. I wish I still had that to some degree because it forced me to be focused. I realized very few people texted me anything urgent that couldn‚Äôt wait a few days. I could still call people with Siri, but nobody called. We‚Äôre optimized to be addicted. That‚Äôs literally the goal of these phones and the apps on them. That‚Äôs not a bad thing. It‚Äôs just not in our best interest.\nI tried using a junk $40 replacement phone I found in my closet while waiting those 45 days to get my iPhone replacement. The phone was from 2015 when I got married - it was a teaser phone from the cell company. It probably downloaded at 2 mbp/s. Any time I clicked a link I had to wait 15-20 seconds for the page to load.\n\nI was amazed. I was shocked this piece of junk actually could take notes. Could email. Could browse the internet. But I also learned not to click on things unless it was worth 30 seconds of my time.\nHow do I spend my time now? Not wisely enough. A lot of things should be done on a computer.

They call this ‚Äúnegative space‚Äù in drawing. A sketch is interesting when the mind can fill in the gaps. As an artist, you just want to make enough dots that they can connect them themselves. This connecting process is the freedom and interest the mind craves. It doesn‚Äôt want to be coddled (The Coddling of the American Mind).\nBack to the book. The Old Man and the Sea can be summarized in one sentence: a tired, old, and recently-unlucky man catches the biggest of his life and it gets eaten before he makes it home.\nThat‚Äôs the surface story, and it‚Äôs rather boring when thought of that way. But you just feel so much while reading it. You feel for the old man through the young boy. You feel for him as he teeters between passing out and existing.

Pretend like it doesn‚Äôt even matter if you accomplish them. This helps free you.\nCareers are like both of these things. We want everything. We can pretend like we have it. We can come to terms with it.

What path did you take that mattered? What were all the alternate realities and multiverses you could have had.\nPut them all together. In one multiverse you‚Äôve been fired. In another you end up getting insanely wealthy. In another you start your own company. In another you become an online blogger.\nAll of them can‚Äôt be true when you do this exercise extensively enough. And choosing which one probably doesn‚Äôt matter as much (right vs wrong path thinking). If you‚Äôve ever left a job you realize that nothing really comes over with you. Most relationships at work are short lived and contextual, like your relationships in high school.

That also means you have a 97% chance you won‚Äôt succeed 5 times in a row.\n\n\n\nFlipping five coins will almost certainly yield at least tails\n\n\nIn life, we sometimes overemphasize winning. Even in the tech world of wanting to fail fast, I think most people just really want to win every time. Nobody seeks failure - that‚Äôs not the goal. They seek other things (learning, promotions, making more money).\nWhen making decisions, it‚Äôs easy to black-and-white them. If there‚Äôs only a 3% change we‚Äôll win 5 times in a row (with a 50% chance of winning every time), there‚Äôs a 97% chance you‚Äôll fail at least once every 5 attempts.\nIf your probability of success is lower, then the odds of failing at once in five are almost 100%.\nHow do you quantify a life decision though? Maybe you only get one big choice a year (job change, like as is discussed in How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices). Is there a 50% chance of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù? If so, every five years you‚Äôre highly likely to ‚Äúfail‚Äù.\nPer the book, it‚Äôs more likely that one bad thing happens and we hindsight bias our decision and black-and-white it.\nReality is: getting fired or your startup blowing up might be the best thing that ever happens to you. You just don‚Äôt know. Your story isn‚Äôt written yet. And actually, it‚Äôs not so much about if you made the right choice as if you just make the choice right in some way.\nChoose your love, and then love your choice, as they say.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

So a user who signs up to pay $50 for unlimited data can click one button to join a party and only have to pay $25/mo from then on. Why not just offer users $25 to begin with?\nIt‚Äôs really confusing to me as a user - why not just give me the $25 automatically if it takes nothing to join a group? Because of gamification.\n\n\nWhy it works\nI think their strategy is as follows:\n\nThey hope some people get brought in on marketing and never remember to activate a party pay. Let‚Äôs say this number is 20-40%. Perhaps these users fund the rest of the discounts.\nJoining a party pay group for free is an easy way to make your customers win. I.e., a user gets $25 off for joining. Gimmicky, but I think it works. So a user has an immediate sense of gratification - a great way to build a strong emotional bond. ‚ÄúClick a button to get $25 off in perpetuity? Nice!‚Äù Anyone would agree this feels better than just starting off with $25.\nThis makes users want to share and tell others. Especially if customers feel they‚Äôve gamed the system. Who today doesn‚Äôt like a hack?\n\nBut even if (1) is wrong, and that 95% of people join a party I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve done the math to consider how many people they need to sign up to make the money work.\n\n\nThe Larger Strategy\nWhy would Verizon cannibalize their own sales? I switched my wife out of a $70 unlimited plan on Verizon to a $25 plan on visible for the same service. Well some customers will stay with Verizon because of its prestige and the add on benefits. But users who are cutting the cord are going somewhere else, I‚Äôm thinking Verizon wants to stay ahead of the curve. It‚Äôs a race to the bottom, sure.

And they don‚Äôt get paid any more if you listen 31 or 900 seconds. In fact, they get paid more if you listen to two songs, 30s a piece.\n\nSpotify, Amazon, YouTube, Apple, etc all pay based on views. They each define views their own way, but they need to negotiate with the labels who already decided to agree to Apple‚Äôs 30s schemes in the early 2000‚Äôs. They may have different payment schemes, but some have a scheme of ‚Äútake all revenue, distribute it according to the artist‚Äôs share of views.‚Äù So if I pay $10/mo for Spotify and don‚Äôt use it, my money goes to someone I didn‚Äôt listen to.\nSo how do small artists compete? They‚Äôve got to build their following. Proportionally, the major artists (rather, their labels) soak up all the streaming royalties.\nWhat would be more fair is if my $10 went to the artists I actually listened to, as if I bought their music.\nWhy does any of this matter? Algorithms. Optimization. Monetization.\nIncentives drive outcomes. How we designed our music payment incentives altered music forever (try to be super catchy for 30s).

Because it‚Äôs tasty, I‚Äôd recommend it‚Ä¶‚Äù This came off the heels of multiple times recently where I‚Äôve gone out with people who are foodies that criticize the meal I‚Äôm enjoying and I‚Äôm left wondering: am I a food plebe?\nExperiencing this last night was poignant.

You need to read a lot before the good and the bad start filtering out.\nAnd like fish tacos, maybe there are even better ones out there, but I needed this one to point me in the direction of what‚Äôs possible.\nAnd to some degree, there‚Äôs a dulling of sensitivities. If you haven‚Äôt read good literature in a long while perhaps you assume it‚Äôs all fine and ‚Äúwhy not finish this book?‚Äù\nBut this year I‚Äôm trying to read many authors across many genres to tackle just that: find the books I really enjoy reading.

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve avoided this book so long. I‚Äôm sure I read it in like sixth grade, but does that even count? And why have I largely avoided fiction for most of my adult life?

The man, solitary and rugged, sits at the edge where the wood meets the water, a plate of fish tacos beside him. His hands, calloused and strong, deftly assemble the tacos with an economy of movement that speaks of a life shaped by necessity rather than choice. The fish, freshly caught, bears the scent of the ocean, a fragrance as old as time, mingling with the sharp tang of lime and cilantro.\nAround him, the world seems to hold its breath, the only sounds are the soft lapping of waves against the pilings and the distant cries of gulls, wheeling like specters in the overcast sky. He bites into a taco, the crispness of the tortilla giving way to the tender fish within, a simplicity that belies the depth of flavors. There‚Äôs a harmony here, between man and nature, a momentary peace found in the act of eating, of sustaining oneself with the bounty of the sea.\nAs he eats, his gaze is drawn to the horizon, where the gray of the sea blends indistinguishably with the sky. There‚Äôs a contemplation in his eyes, a man adrift in his thoughts as he is in life, finding solace in the simple pleasure of a meal. The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself‚Äîuncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction. In this moment, on this pier, the man and the sea are one, their stories intertwined in the quiet, unspoken understanding that life, in all its forms, is a series of solitary moments shared with the world.\n\nDang‚Ä¶‚Äúlife shaped by necessity rather than choice‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself‚Äîuncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad Ernest is somewhere in there, AI.

    "text": "When I walked into #Google I was so excited to learn how to code like the pros. The only coding I truly learned was the recurring daily complaint by the engineers there ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm just moving protos again today‚Äù.\nMoving protos‚Ä¶what?\nProtobufs, or protos as they‚Äôre affectionately called, are a type of configuration file. And Google‚Äôs architecture is so advanced that fewer folks spend time coding and more time manipulating protos to improve the software.\nWhy? Because software 2.0 is impossible to automate or code. Why? The book Power and Prediction explains how future software has trillions of possible combinations of design.\n#YouTube has a deep learning algorithm called Brain that has one main job: figure out the probability a person will click on a video.\nOn top of this, they do what all recommendation systems do: they customize the diversity of content or the categories of content. Do you want more videos similar to video X? Do you want more educational content, but very different video?\nAll recommendation systems operate like this: an ML model at the base and then rules and configurations to overlay on top. And the protos control the configurations. And the software engineers analyze the metrics coming from your ‚Äúwatch time‚Äù. Their job is then to manipulate the proto files to improve the system.\nSo when they ‚Äúmove protos‚Äù all day long, they‚Äôre just getting systems to talk to each other.\n‚ÄúHow should I configure my ___ pipeline?‚Äù - asked every engineer ever. Here I take a dive into ways that I‚Äôve seen #machinelearning pipelines be configured.\nhttps://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/configurations-for-ml-pipelines.html\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "I‚Äôm thinking about Three cold calls and what I learned.\nOne guy hears my pitch and in 5 minutes he‚Äôs nodding his head. Then he asks, ‚ÄúWhy do you charge $650 but people in India tell me they can do it for $225?‚Äù He says he gets these calls all the time.\nAnother guy says, ‚ÄúI paid $250/year for my website. There‚Äôs no way I can justify your costs. I‚Äôm a simple guy and I don‚Äôt need anything fancy.‚Äù This second guy raked me over the coals an I know I shouldn‚Äôt give in but I took it as a learning experience to see what might happen.\nHe gets me to basically offer my services at cost, but I tell him I can only keep the deal open tonight. He responds:\n\nThat may work for me, but I always avoid making decisions under pressure, such a false urgency. Give me a few days to think about it. What do you have to lose?\n\n\nI thought a lot about this. It‚Äôs an interesting question. I know from $100M Leads, This is Marketing, and Emotional Intelligence for Sales Success that when you concede, you regret it. And it‚Äôs a race to the bottom on price.\nAt his rates, someone would need to maintain 500 websites per year to support a family. That‚Äôs an insane amount of overhead. He should just use squarespace for $20/mo. I told him this.\nThe first guy hears my pitch and says, ‚Äúsee what I like about this is you‚Äôre here in San Jose. I could come see you if I want. I don‚Äôt want some random company in India that doesn‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù\nThe thought of ‚ÄúI could never justify this‚Äù is fascinating. It tells me this person is transaction focused. It‚Äôs quite easy to ‚Äújustify‚Äù when you consider operating your business quickly. I could get him the site today. Instead he‚Äôs taking people over the coals until he works with someone desperate enough to take his offer. The justification is: does this service get me more leads?\nBut he didn‚Äôt see it that way. He only saw, ‚ÄúI can get this cheaper elsewhere.‚Äù\nThose two mentalities are two I‚Äôve struggled with. Most of my life I‚Äôve focused on getting things done more cheaply and feeling like I‚Äôm being robbed. Or, focusing on solving the problem.\nPer Thinking, Fast and Slow we have two sides of our brain. If we lose $100 bill on the way to buy $100 worth of tickets we‚Äôre likely to buy the tickets with a new $100. If we lose two pre-purchased tickets on the way to the show, we‚Äôre likely to walk away rather than spend $100 to buy two new tickets. The cost is the same, but the mental and emotional accounting is different. This is sunk cost.\nPerson 1 is relationship and growth focused. They want the problem gone so they can focus on other things. They also say ‚Äúyea I could get this cheaper somewhere but there are several costs like time, energy, and dealing with India I don‚Äôt wanna deal with.‚Äù He says ‚Äúif it gets me two customers a month it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù He‚Äôs value focused. He doesn‚Äôt think: ‚Äúcan I get this cheaper somewhere else?‚Äù\nSecond guy is not value focused but transaction and price focused. Maybe he does this with everyone he meets. It‚Äôll slow him down. As a home builder he could get $10000 clients from a well built website. That‚Äôs not worth $100/mo for him so he‚Äôs going to get a crappy site with no traffic (I‚Äôve built many crappy sites that don‚Äôt get traffic. Good sites require work!)\nDo business with value-based customers. They grow faster. They‚Äôre deal oriented. Relationship oriented.\nDon‚Äôt do business with transaction/cost-oriented customers. They‚Äôll take you up front and throughout your journey, costing far more in time and energy, which allows your momentum and hurts your growth.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

Here‚Äôs what happens behind the scenes.\nHere‚Äôs a list of everything that I did:\n\nMigrate from Outlook to Gmail. Fix my DNs records so I don‚Äôt get flagged as spam. My company‚Äôs website crashes (it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm gonna gut it anyway and move over to what I‚Äôm putting my customers on.)\nset up an account for my web dev to build a site for my customer.\nReview my web devs site. Evaluate quality. Find broken links.\nCall 4 people my cold caller found. They‚Äôre all interested.\nFollow up text with one. He tries grinding 95% of my margin. I let him. I regret it. Deal falls through anyway. He‚Äôs not my target customer.\npost updates on Facebook. Someone I haven‚Äôt spoken too in 15 years calls me greedy. I‚Äôm working 80 hour weeks with no pay for the next three months c supporting people who are otherwise unemployed. Some people just wanna tear you down. I‚Äôve heard it spoken that when you try to do something, the people not in the arena like throwing boos. But the people on the field respect you. ‚ÄúIt is not the critic who counts.‚Äù As that quote goes. Dare bravely.\nSend material to my social media manager.\nReview the work she did. Get stoked. She‚Äôs crushing it. My clients like it.\nReach out to owner to ask what they want on their website. Don‚Äôt hear back. Check in next week I suppose.\nSend out 6 onboarding forms. 3 don‚Äôt reply. Check back next week I suppose.\nDiscuss with my ads manager how to do ads. Customer asks me questions. I‚Äôm relaying info to my manager. I‚Äôm learning. Try to schedule time. Pause writing this because I realize I forgot to schedule that follow up time with my customers.\nMy customers are so busy they don‚Äôt have time to respond. I‚Äôm so busy trying to remember who I‚Äôve responded to.\nReach back out to 10 warm leads. People interested but too busy to respond. I send out a calendar invite just to see if that‚Äôs easier than trying to text them again. It is. The random time I picked didn‚Äôt work (as expected). They responded with a better time (amazing). I‚Äôm one step closer to helping them get the site they want. Success.\nReach out to a family member who posted on Facebook about their construction business. They knew I stated a business but didn‚Äôt know exactly what. We have an hour chat. They realize I may be able to help them. Document new lead. Follow up for Monday.\nThis said family member on my wife‚Äôs side is surprisingly a customer of my cousins on my side. Wild. I realize that my cousin is a chiropractor. I could potentially help him build his business. Try calling, out of office. Make a new lead in my CRM. Follow up next Wednesday.\nDo an audit of a site. Send out a response. Didn‚Äôt get an answer. Decided instead of texting I‚Äôll do the same thing as above and send another cal invite. Waiting to hear back.\nOne of the four interested cold calls said he was super interested and to call back on Friday. I‚Äôm stoked. Then I call back Friday. He says call back in 15. I call back in 45 bc of another meeting. He silences my call and sends me straight to voicemail. I send a text. No response. Follow up one time next week before closing as a lost. People are weird. But I get it. He didn‚Äôt recognize our convo from Wednesday. He doesn‚Äôt have time to deal with this decision. I know how that goes.\nthird interested guy says he‚Äôll sign up next week once he gets paid. Stoked. Send reminder in CRM. Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt forget me like the Friday guy.\nFourth interested guy says to call back in the evening that very same day. He‚Äôs stoked. I call back but his daughter broke her arm just hours earlier. Going to hospital. I‚Äôm surprised he responded at all. I send him a text the next day wishing his daughter well. I call back two days later and he‚Äôs at the dentist. He appreciated my text. I choose to set up time next Tuesday. He agrees. Hope is still alive.\nPay my workers for their hard work. Realize I‚Äôm still losing money. That‚Äôs expected. im investing.\nwrite down all the tools I‚Äôve subscribed to in the last three weeks.\nSend credentials to my team so they can use these tools.\nGet four audits from my SEO expert. Tell him what to improve. He sends back more content.\nmove content to Google drive.\nSet up client folders on Google drive. Set up documents with info per client to collaborate. Have assistant help.\nspend 3 hours preparing for key partner. I spent 10 the prior week. I‚Äôm excited. Call goes well.\nSend material to other potential key partner. He‚Äôs excited. I‚Äôm excited. May be a few weeks or months before it‚Äôs a good time though. Keep building. Remember to follow up.\nReach out to another key partner.\nA friend from high school I haven‚Äôt seen since 2008 wants to chat. He does what I do but for sales (I‚Äôm on marketing). Have a chat. He tells me he wants to send me clients. I tell him I need his help. He sets up more time on Monday to chat. Hope builds.\ncollege friend who does a different type of SEO than me reaches out. His cousin needs help with Local SEO (my specialty). I send phone number.\nSaid cousin calls me within an hour. I don‚Äôt recognize the number but I pick up now. Person is from my grandma‚Äôs home town. Wild. Another small connection. Person asks me about Google business profile. I answer. They seem relieved. They ask for my services. I send a doc. Set up time to chat Tuesday.\nDecline meeting with one person because I‚Äôm so busy.\nGo to work because I‚Äôm not full time. Manage work‚Ä¶.\nSet up asana instead of ClickUp for task management. Asana is expensive. ClickUp is free. But ClickUp is complicated. I realize $100/mo is not worth complication.\nAdd 6 people to asana. Track down their emails. Realize I forgot each persons hourly rate. Create an HR spreadsheet.\nAdd 4 people to slack. I need to get off email for internal work. Happy.\nJust realized I forgot to add that friends cousin to my CRM. Pause now to add them. They‚Äôre added 3 minutes later. Had to look up their email to add to my CRM.\nRealized my CRM isn‚Äôt connected to my email. Sync is broken. Reach out to customer support.\nRealize after switching Gmail to Outlook that calendly and outlook are stuck to the Microsoft version of my email address. That‚Äôs weird. Fix outlook in my mobile. Fix calendly. Can now book appointments properly. Success.\nHad a customer call. Chat for 30 min about next steps. Phone dies mid call. Back to real job.\nrealize I paid my part timer for not doing anything this week. Crap. I quickly send them their task, which was stuck in draft mode on slack. I make a note to my assistant to ensure this doesn‚Äôt slip through.\nGet access to Google business profiles. Send them to my developer.\nMigrate subscriptions off of an old Gmail. I‚Äôm official now. I should have everything on my @silvermineai.com domain\nAdd all subscriptions to my finance tracker.\nRandom people I haven‚Äôt spoken to in years or ever start commenting on my fb posts. I reach out to one. They have a non-profit. I suddenly want to help. I now can because I do websites. They need help with their website. I get excited about their mission.\nHopped on Facebook to post this. Realize there‚Äôs an ad about Facebook marketing. I click. The content is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I could probably find it online on YouTube but I buy a 2.5 hour course. Paid content is usually better than free. Not always. I say no to all upselling stuff. Inbox gets links to the course.\nChat with guy about working together on something else. Realize I didn‚Äôt text him back. Just opened my notes and sent him the thing I 95% finished.\nAfter sending this blurb I realized I have a buddy I‚Äôve been meaning to reach out to. I do a quick audit of his Google ranking for his stores. I send off some analytics.\nThree nights this week I only got 6 hours of sleep. Body fatigue.\n\nWhy am I doing this?\n\nSupport my family. I‚Äôve got 6 mouths to feed. California is a tough break for anyone trying to live here. Taxes are high. Most people are dual income. This raises housing prices.\nEmpower others. I find intense emotional fulfillment in helping others grow.\nGrow. I‚Äôm up for new challenges. This is right up my alley.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "What have I learned since June 7th, the day I announced my marketing agency on Facebook?\n\nThere are so many entrepreneurs in my network. People building and growing. People with dreams of creating value in their own unique way. I think I‚Äôve spoken to 15 people off that one post alone.\nThere are people who want to work with you. You just have to let them know you‚Äôre open for business.\nCreating value is about doing things that others don‚Äôt have time for, but know is important. We all have 100 things going on in our overly busy lives. It‚Äôs a relief to outsource those problems where we can.\nSo many ideas stall because people just forget of them. People tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôve wanted to do this for years but other priorities have taken place‚Äù. Hiring someone can help provide a catalyst of new ideas and opportunities.\nSome people are reasonably skeptical. So many scammers out there in the marketing world. I hope to make a difference. I see the opportunity for good marketing.\nI‚Äôve transitioned mentally from being an individual contributor to an operator. I‚Äôve got four team members who just hammer away at tasks I send them. It‚Äôs stressful, but exciting!\nAnyone using AI tools can do remarkable things. High schoolers on AI can do as much as a 5 year experienced individual. My team is remote and the tools they use make their work shine as good as I could have done it.\nAI is enabling people with good ideas to provide exceptional value. I‚Äôm a software engineer by trade and being able to work with marketing AI tools is really exciting.\nI‚Äôm exhausted. In the best way possible. I couldn‚Äôt do it without Veronica Rosdahl Whiting‚Äôs support.\nit‚Äôs fairly easy to give a really hardworking individual a life changing amount of money for doing solid work. I paid this guy $40 for helping me organize a bunch of stuff. He said it was life changing. Super humbling to learn of the great fortunes we have in the US. I could then hire him full time as my executive assistant and he‚Äôs helping us serve our 6 new customers since June 7th.\n\n\n\nmarketing is about following up. About showing up. Reach out to everyone who likes your post. Ask them if they know anyone. Ask them if there‚Äôs some way you can help them.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

    "text": "Token 1.17: Deploying ML Model: Best practices feat. LLMs - Companies will have a question of what models to use: cloud based, cloud open, or internal open. - GPT: closed cloud. - Llama: open internal. - Perplexity/Mistral hosting: open cloud. - my Assumption is that open cloud will catch up. Especially when they match it with vector embeddings. No provider does both embeddings and inference as a service, which is interesting. - Thoughts on vector DBs Reddit - Dive into anything - Seems cool: Lightning AI, which allows you to do like a repl type solution but for AI. Curious how good the editor is.\nThe Lazy Tyranny of the Wait Calculation - by Ethan Mollick - waiting for tech to be competent to achieve your vision or hop on the train? - I think software will catch up quickly. Our ability to get to a solution faster means faster prototyping, pickier customers, but ultimately more junk. The question of product market fit will always be the question, regardless if you wait. But some ideas may be worth trying a year from now rather than doing all this stuff that will be obsolete with the next AI release. - This blog itself wouldn‚Äôt be possible without Obsidian Mobile, free GitHub repos, Working Copy App, and quarto and iOS shortcuts. so the technologies need to converge to enable certain innovations (in this case my peculiar system for how to blog online from my phone)\n\n\n\nDreaming of cloud solutions\n\n\nGPTs won‚Äôt make you rich - by Charlie Guo - GPTs are now available. The Teams pricing is now available.\nWhy knowledge management is foundational to AI success - Stack Overflow - Generic old news. General principles that garbage in, garbage out.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever‚Äôs on his mind.

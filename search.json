    "text": "Christianity is life. It’s a way of living. It’s an aspiration to follow the beattitudes, to be kind when others are harsh, to be calm when the storm is raging. These posts reflect my desire to reflect His light in every day living, through both study and application.\nI’m a Christian, which means I believe in a Savior and Messiah who was born miraculously, lived perfectly, gave His life selflessly, and resurrected divinely so that there’s hope in this life for all of us. He was the perfect example of how to treat everyone with kindness, respect, and decency. He also taught his students how to think deeply, lead unconventionally, and live life with selfless purpose. His life is filled with a richness worth studying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n     \n     \n       Order By\n       Default\n         \n          Date - Oldest\n        \n         \n          Date - Newest\n        \n         \n          Title\n        \n     \n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Eyes track Red\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday May 21, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherhood\n\n\n\nsacrament-symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday May 12, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s my Foundation Model?\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday April 28, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA foundation on Christ\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\ntrials\n\n\nfoundation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday April 28, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Veil was Torn\n\n\n\nsacrament-symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday April 28, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t deserve this Seat\n\n\n\nsacrament-symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday April 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial Service\n\n\n\nsacrament-symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday April 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob 1 - Viewing Christ\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday April 5, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob 2 - Give Freely\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\ncharity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday April 3, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWearing a Tie Reminds me of the Noose Around His Neck\n\n\n\nsacrament-symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday March 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEaster, the most important holiday\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday March 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEaster Study: Seek Miracles\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday March 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 31 -\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday March 23, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 31.3\n\n\n\nfavorite scriptures\n\n\n\nSelected quotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday March 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfinite Suffering of Everyone\n\n\n\nsacrament-symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday March 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-03-17 Come Follow Me CTR 7 - 2 Nephi 26-30 - Apostasy\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\ncome follow me lesson plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday March 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 27 The Purpose of the Book of Mormon\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\ncome follow me\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday March 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 26 - pride\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\ncome follow me\n\n\n\nThose with pride in their hearts seek power over others\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday March 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 26\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday March 11, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking into the church Reminds me of Disciples Running to the Tomb\n\n\n\nsacrament-symbols\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday March 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 21.6\n\n\n\nfavorite scriptures\n\n\n\nSelected quotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday March 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 20-25 Lesson Plan\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\ncome follow me\n\n\ncome follow me lesson plan\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday March 9, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 25 - We Talk of Christ\n\n\n\nchristianity\n\n\ncome follow me\n\n\ncommandments\n\n\n\nThe law is dead.

That we’re always better at helping someone else through a challenge than helping ourselves - because we’re all biased by our “inside view”.\nReading Influence The Psychology of Persuasion there’s an anecdote mentioned about the allegory of the long spoons: Heaven and Hell: The Parable of the Long Spoons - Sofo Archon. Essentially heaven and hell are both the same: it’s a room full of people with no elbows and long spoons trying to eat a sumptuous feast. What makes it hell is that they can’t bend their elbows to eat! What makes it heaven is that everyone is just feeding other people.\nMarriage is a union of two no-elbow people.

One for my mom, to try to comfort and counsel her.\nI’m grateful for doctors of the mind who help alleviate sicknesses of stress, anxiety, depression, etc. I know more people with some type of recurring emotional distress than I know without.

Christ invited everyone to change their ways by letting go of the things that didn’t bring them true happiness, and focus on the things that do.

I’ve witnessed spiritual healing through prayer, which is the process of going from feeling forgotten to then knowing I am a child of God and he has a plan for me.\n\n\nHe Came to Heal\nThis to me is the meaning of Christmas: healing. Freedom from bruised bodies, broken minds, or hurting hearts. He came to be broken, so that we may be healed.\n\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. Isaiah 53:5\n\n\nHe will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities. Alma 7:12\n\nNot all healing happens in an instant, and sometimes some things don’t fully heal or heal at all. But I’m grateful healing is possible and there are doctors in the constant pursuit of it. And I’m grateful for friends who have, at times, helped heal me in all these ways.\nMost of us won’t be known as doctors. But all of us try the best we can to help heal our loved ones, such as healing a child with a band aid, a spouse with a hug, a friend with a lunch.

    "text": "Today at church someone was confirmed a member of the Church after having been baptized yesterday. This taught me something new about the sacrament and the covenant we make with Him every week.\n\n\n\nReceive the Holy Ghost\n\n\n\nEntry into His Church by Baptism\nAfter baptism, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nBut now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt baptize by water, and they shall receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even as the apostles of old. Doctrine and Covenants 35.6\n\nThere is precedence for this, as the Savior gave the gift of the Holy Ghost to his apostles after he was no longer tarrying with them:\n\nAnd when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: John 20.22\n\nPausing on that thought for a moment, let’s consider the last sentence in the sacrament prayer on the bread:\n\nthat they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 4.3\n\nAlso consider that the last of the water prayer omits that word “always”:\n\nthat they may have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 5.2\n\nAre they contradictory? No. Because the full last sentence of the water prayer says:\n\nthat they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 5.2\n\nThis tells us that if we always remember him (the Savior), we’ll have His spirit to be with us.\nBack to the New Teatament. The Lord taught His disciples that the comforter would come to them once He left:\n\nNevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. John 16.7\n\nAnd in a prior chapter, Jesus had instructed that this was the plan - that he would give them the gift of the Comforter when He was gone. Notice the word “another”:\n\nAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. John 14.16–18\n\nPerhaps He said “another” Comforter because He is the first?\nHe further promised the role of the Holy Ghost is to teach of truth and testify of the Savior:\n\nBut when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: John 15.26\n\nThe Lord also explained how He works with the Holy Ghost. It appears that, because the Savior was with them, He was their source of truth. But as He was planning to leave them He needed to leave them with a source of truth. As such, they were being prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nThese things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. John 14.25–26\n\nThis doesn’t mean they didn’t have the spirit - how else could Peter have received His spiritual witness of the Savior? matthew-16.15-17\nWhat do these scriptures all teach me?\n\nIf we always remember the Savior, we’ll have His spirit to be with us\nHis spirit teaches us what is truth: it testifies of Christ\nHe gave this gift because we can’t always be in His presence.\nEven if we were in His presence, we’d need the spirit to let us know that He is the Christ\nWhen we receive the Holy Ghost after baptism, we are commanded to “receive the Holy Ghost” by confirmation into the church.\n\n\n\nWhat is the “gift” of the Holy Ghost?\nThis last one is powerful, because of a clarifying point in the handbook of the church:\n\n\nStates “receive the Holy Ghost” (not “receive the gift of the Holy Ghost”).\n18. Performing Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings\n\n\nOr, the “gift” of the Holy Ghost perhaps isn’t a thing like the priesthood - something bestowed upon us. (This is something I’ve thought it was my whole life - a gift I receive.) why aren’t we told to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?\nWhat, then, is legally binding about the Lord’s covenant? And what is the “gift of the Holy Ghost” as mentioned in the scriptures? (Articles of Faith 1.4, Moses 5.58, Jacob 6.8, Doctrine and Covenants 39.23, Doctrine and Covenants 49.14, Acts 10.45, and like 4 other references…it’s referenced in every standard work!)\nEven the Lord says he’ll bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nAnd whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them. Doctrine and Covenants 33.15\n\nBecause we don’t “receive the gift of the Holy Ghost”, perhaps the gift of the Holy Ghost is instead the promised blessing of the constant companionship as a result of keeping our covenant. Things consistent with the definitions in the Guide to the Scriptures:\n\nIt is the right of every worthy baptized member of the Church to have the constant influence of the Holy Ghost. Following a person’s baptism into the true Church of Jesus Christ, he receives the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands from one who has the proper authority Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nAnyone on earth can enjoy the Holy Ghost. It teaches those of truth. But only those of the covenant of baptism, who keep that covenant and the Sacrament Covenant (To always remember Him, keep His commandments, and take His name upon us), are blessed always with His spirit. Things the gift of the Holy Ghost: its constant companionship.\n\nWhile someone is being confirmed a member of the Church, he or she is told to “receive the Holy Ghost.” The gift of the Holy Ghost is not forced on anyone. It becomes the responsibility of members to invite the Holy Ghost to be with them Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nAnd perhaps the ordinance of the confirmation is to start that covenant: “receive the Holy Ghost now, and always as you remember Me.”\nAnd why do we always want His spirit to be with us? Because the spirit is a proxy for Him: the Comforter, the Source of Truth, the Light and Life of the World. When we have that spirit, we are of the Kingdom of Heaven (on earth).\nSo when I take the sacrament every week, I’m making the covenant to always remember Him so that I can enjoy the gift of receiving the Holy Ghost always.\n\nWhy is this relevant to me personally?\n\nthe gift isn’t some separate power that I can offend or please. It’s not some separate God. Instead, the gift is a covenant. This changes my focus away from a relationship with the Holy Ghost and instead a relationship with the Savior. The purpose of the holy ghost is to point me to the Savior. And if I’m not feeling the spirit, it’s not about trying to please the Holy Ghost - I just need to begin remembering the savior in that moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat. 37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Luke 7.36–38\n\nThe Pharisees didn’t like that she was a sinner.\n\nNow when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. Luke 7.39\n\nWe are redeemed by Him when we come with such a spirit as this woman.\n\nBehold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered. 2 Nephi 2.7\n\n\n\nMeaning\nThe sacrament isn’t for those who are perfect. It’s for me, a sinner. One who sins. And is sinning and doesn’t even know it. One who is separated from the happiness God would have me fully feel because of my ignorance, my natural state. I am good. I am loved. When I pray, He already knows I’m a sinner and loves me regardless. He doesn’t want me to see myself as a sinner, but as a worshipper who has much to grow from. And I am growing.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Our cognitive bias forces us to see the “active in the feminist movement” as overwhelmingly likely.\nThe reality is that the likelihood of a feminist being a bank teller requires the likelihood of being a feminist and the likelihood of being a bank teller and the likelihood of both - which is far less likely than either one apart.\nTechnical terms: assume the “base rate” for being a feminist is 20% in the population. Then assume the base rate probability of being a bank teller is 3%. The probability of being both (assuming independence) is 20% x 3%.\nIt’s called the “Conjuction Fallacy” where we’re more likely to associate with the more reasonable description and put behind us the rarer likelihood of the two things happening together…or being conjunctive.\n#datascience #bias\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Because there’s the data that comes in, which we then build our models on. And we do a bunch of analytics on that data.\nAs a data scientist, I always* want to deal with the true source data, because if someone else took a raw dataset and rounded the numbers or injected some multiplications then I have no idea how to analyze it. (*Yea maybe not “always”…true source data usually never actually looks good or is ever in the format you want. Data engineering can help…)\nBy going straight to the true source I know that either my data provider is off or I’m off when something looks weird.\nIs the same principle in journalism: primary vs secondary sources…\nI’ve personally come to learn that spending quiet time, praying and meditating, are the best forms of true source data collection.\n\n\n\nGo to the source\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Manage the Mental Game\nWatching the best players in the world is fun, because even the best players in the world still feel like the worst players in the world. The emotional game is the same. Nobody feels good enough. Nobody liked how that turns out. And if you’re lucky to win (after all the hard work you put in), you’re probably more relieved than excited.\nIt’s hard going into an event with total expectations of success. Perhaps that’s not the right mindset. Perhaps the right mindset is to just try your best on any given shot.\nWatch the world number 1 miss tons of puts by inches. How he recovers and maintains perspective for all 18 holes is why he’s number 1.\nAs a stastician, each shot should technically be uncorrelated: the quality of a shot shouldn’t be determined by the quality of the prior shot. But the mind plays lots of games. Mental correlation is real. Manage the mind game. Take each day as independent.\nScotty/\nhttps://www.masters.com/en_US/watch/2024-04-13/17130593777795026/every_single_shot_scottie_schefflers_third_round.html\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Lots.\nMusicians have to find product market fit. They need to find their customers. Their monthly listeners.\nThey need to keep them coming back.\nThey need to differentiate.\nThose who are customer focused and build a following are those who succeed. (Money in the bank and relying too much on the label can cripple you)\n\nThe Musicians in Town\nI remember hanging out with some new artists while I was running my startup (we both used the same videographer). I couldn’t help but notice how similar the dynamics were. The founders. The first hires (replacements). The convos about who gets what.

Here are but a few suggestions: (1) We can distinguish more clearly between divine discontent and the devil’s dissonance, between dissatisfaction with self and disdain for self. We need the first and must shun the second, remembering that when conscience calls to us from the next ridge, it is not solely to scold but also to beckon.\n\n(Just dropping that in case Bezos gets all the credit for the term 😉.)\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

This isn’t anything new.\nAnd putting aside beliefs about the war itself, I see the angle here as somewhat inauthentic. It assumes tech is somehow awful.\nArms dealers will always be in the race for selling more arms, whether in peace or in war. But providing services at a discounted rate to defend an invaded ally seems reasonable.\nMy point: I wish we had more positive tech news. Tech is how we won WWII and almost how we lost it. That same awful WWII tech is how we now power homes with cleaner energy across the world. Some argue it’s how we’ve avoided a WWIII so far because it’s a nuclear war is an unwinnable war.\nTech cannot control the hearts of the men and women who wield it. It can only enable them. May we all strive for wars of words and code not wars of people or weapons, and I actually think tech helps enable that. And hopefully, we can use tech to facilitate misunderstandings and bring people to better diplomacy, ending the need for war. But that’s up to the leaders. Desires for war rage within hearts long before those desires rage within bullets.\nAs for the main stream media, I’d hope for more nuanced discussions around the uses of tech. Perhaps that’s what it’s alluding to - that war mongers are being fueled by this war.\nBut then let’s get more diplomatic leaders into office that can manage peace talks. It’s a people problem. Our government shouldn’t be run by the war machine, but by the people. And tech will always enable the people to do what they do best: be human.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I only tried once before declaring victory.\nWhy is this poem meaningful to me? Because it has my soul in it. It’s the summation of my experience as a parent. Should you find it interesting, perhaps that’s why.\nReading The Best of Edgar Allen Poe recently I’m amazed (besides how depressing he is) at how excellent a writer he is. He peers into the mind and soul and extricates anything interesting. It’s interesting because a human wrote it.\nDo we still paint, even if a camera can take a picture? Do we still ride bikes and horses even with cars and things? Do we still read even though we have TV and movies?\nWords. Creative expression. They will always be interesting to us. Humans are interesting to us. Stories. Social acceptance is a fundamental human need. We desire connection. We’ll like reading something because a human wrote it.\nBut what about that guy I heard about who makes a ton of money using ChatGPT to create fake digital books on Amazon. People don’t know it’s AI-written. Digital GenAI images now are insanely accurate - it’s only 2024. It’s very possible great AI art will inspire us more than non-AI art (whatever that means because everyone uses photoshop anyway).\nI’m not saying we won’t find value in AI art (creative writing, digital, video, etc.). We will. It’s clear we’ll have a really hard time knowing what’s human vs not.\nBut I am saying that creativity will never disappear. We’re always going to be interested in creating - even if machines can do it better. Machines can beat us at Go and StarCraft (AI Robots are mastering tasks faster than humans), but we’ll still play. Because what else will there be to do?\n\n\n\nI guess I’ll pick up painting now…\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "Configurations for ML Pipelines",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Configuring an ML pipeline means you have 15 different things that could change at any time and you create a way to easily change those 15 things. Those 15 things could be file paths, data filtering steps, models you want to use, etc.\nAny researcher constantly asks themselves: but what if I switch X parameter? What would happen?\nAnd so the researcher starts to configure a pipeline.\n\nConfig Methods I’ve Used\nFirst time I built a config it was in VBA. I had a text file I loaded in that could be overwritten based on a setting someone chose.\nSecond time I config’d something was in Python. I used ConfigParser, a Python standard library class. It was pretty good for 2017. But unwieldy. Don’t use this. It had cool string substitutions but there are better tools now.\nThird thing I saw was using a Python constants.py file. Just import Python variables from another module. This is nice because you can import model objects or such. Dicts. Whatever. Seems great. But it’s Python code. Config files probably shouldn’t be code. They should be configs. Configs are easy to read for non-tech folks. They have no dependencies. They’re just plain text files. Every great software follows this, like k8s helm charts or whatever. Google loves using Protobufs. Configs shouldn’t be code, because if they’re code they’re dangerous. You start doing crazy things with them.\nFourth thing I did was to use YAML which is very clean. Lots of people like YAML. This gets unwieldy if you need 100 configs for different customers, for example. Can you imagine managing 100 yaml files? What if you need to update one param? Then you need to update 100 files. Rough. So then you start setting “default” blocks and settings.\nA nice pairing was to use Pydantic to read in the YAML file and validate types. You’ve got to validate types. What’s an int vs a string? Using pydantic means that we needed to design the pipeline to rely on some config class on the top level. My suggestion would be to design functions to take in arguments that are satisfied by the config, and don’t pass the config object itself into the function. The former keeps your code cleaner and more testable. The latter sends you down a chaotic slippery slope.\nFifth thing was to use one default YAML. This solved the issue of redundancy across all the 100 YAML files. (If you only have one model, you probably need only 1 YAML file so this may not be your problem.) But this still kinda stinks. It’s in a file.\nSixth thing was some eng’s on my team saw a better way and build a CRUD database. This made it so we didn’t have to do a code change to update a config. That means that people outside the team could edit a config. Awesome. But we still have 100 web pages that could change. Kinda sux. And we still had a default setting - essential. Benefits of a crud are migrations. You can get rid of one option across 100 configs more easily.\nProblem with 100 YAML or 100 web pages is that if you want to change things or run experiments, you need to literally clone the config file. Now you have 15 versions of the same config file with slight modifications and you can’t remember what’s going on. So you delete them all eventually and just pick one.\nSeventh thing: shove everything into environment variables. Create a .env file and load with dotenv() but that gets messy because env files don’t support data type validation. Validation is essential, lest you try to encode a Boolean in your env file only to realize environment variables only support strings and then you have a “False” rendering as true in your “if os.get(MY_BOOL)” call just because it exists as a valid string. Blech… 🤮\n\n\nHydra?\nI’ve been using Hydra lately and I see a lot of benefits in that it solves a lot of the things I’ve tried and seen solved above.\n\n\n\nHydra!\n\n\nHydra | Hydra\n\nHydra is Python open source maintained by Facebook\nIf built to configure pipelines, in particular ML pipelines but could be used for anything that needs config files.\nIt uses dataclasses, which ensures the typing of your files\nIt uses yaml files as the config sources\nYou can specify default config values\nIt quickly allows you to override config files from the command line or from editing the yaml file directly.\nIt’s possible to run from the command line a single config with several different values using the multirun flag.\nIt gives a nice way to organize your output folder and automatically exports the fully qualified config there.\nIt will capture your logs into your output directory.\nYou can version your configs very easily.\n\nThis demo is slick:\n\n\n\nWhy I like Hydra’s design\n\nThis seems really nice because it avoids the headache of changing code.\nAlso, you can create a simple bash loop to execute 5 different experiments - while retaining only one config file. Or you can just use the multirun flag to cross a few arguments easily. It’ll create separate output folders for each run.\nHydra maintains a system of record for every run. You know exactly how that run was generated given the parameters fed into it.\n\n\n\nMy Ideal World\nHydra makes it incredibly easy to kick off a bunch of runs without managing multiple configurations or hard-coding constants into a Python file.\nIt enables you to have parameters outside of your code. This makes experimentation very easy.\nIt does not make it easy for non-developers to edit the config - so you’d still want a GUI to enable that that translates into yaml files. This isn’\nIt’s lightweight - all it does is create a config class that you then pass into your pipeline to control the pipeline. That pipeline could be airflow or whatever.\nIt may be nice to pair hydra with metaflow or flyte.\nHow do you configure? # Appendix\n\nEasy Hyperparameter Management with Hydra, MLflow, and Optuna | by NT | Optuna | Medium\nWhy you should log with Aimstack\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Public accountability is the greatest motivator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese goals are correlated with, but not causal to happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey’re anti-sad, but pro-happy comes not from checking off boxes but by building meaningful relationships with God, self, family, and friends.\nWhy do I measure? Because whenever things aren’t going well I often attribute it to a lacking of one of these things. But I don’t keep this checkbox list to make me happy. Happiness is perspective and relationships. Purpose. So why this list? Well, they’re the foundation of a guided, structured, and prosperous life.\n\nStudying scriptures and praying teaches me who I am and what my purpose is here on earth. It also gives me perfect role models to follow (Christ’s example in the scriptures, and God’s influence on me during prayer). What better way to guide your rudder (as Christensen says), than to be influenced by God on a daily basis. They say you’re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Why not make the number 1 person you spend your most valuable time to be God? (I don’t have to spend 5 hours. 5 very meaningful minutes can correct my day.)\nWriting about my study is my little attempt to share God’s light with the world. Imagine what social media would look like if everyone shared an insight from Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Ghandi, Jesus, Mohammad, on a daily basis and how that insight affected their perspective? Be the change you want to see in the world, they say.\nWriting gratitude rewires my brain. It causes me to see things I wouldn’t. Why not just say things I’m grateful for during prayer or a gratitude journal? I dunno. Those things don’t help me for some reason. It always feels forced (I’ve tried it dozens of ways). Somehow, writing in public, gives me a great sense of “I mean it.” Helps me think about that thing. Give it real thought.\nPhysical health. Strength helps my bones. The effects of weight lifting are seen over decades, not months. I need to take better care of my bones. Same with cardio. They both energize today, but they prevent a whole host of bad things tomorrow and beyond. The effects are compounding - in both directions. Physical health also drives me to eat better. Eating better doesn’t cause me to exercise, but exercising caueses me to eat better. Less snacks.\nMeditating helps me train my mind. It’s a moment where I think about something I want to improve on. Less reactivity as a dad to kids misbehaving. More optimism. More appreciation for the body I have, the health I enjoy, the freedom I have in this world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 Goals: Read, hike, pray, meditate, workout, give thanks daily, study scripture daily\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\n\nDeepen my relationship with and connection to God, self, family, and friends.\nEnjoy intellectual growth and historical understanding\nHave fun.\n\n\n\nKPIs\nReading:\n\n52 books. 12 fiction. 12 biographies. 12 business/self help. 4 religious.

    "text": "Max Plank, GPT 4\n\n\n\n“Scientific Freedom”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: A scientist isn’t a title, but a philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists are hampered by the peer review process. The notion that some tolerate the process so they can get their grants approved and get tenure, and others eventually accept the process because that’s how they got tenure, is a sad outcome of human incentives.\nInterestingly, inventions have always happened regardless of peer review. Edison didn’t need someone to review his invention to tell him whether or not it’s a valid invention. Either the light bulb illuminates or it doesn’t.\nYet that’s exactly how things go now. So what’s the result?\nPeople write to please the peer reviewer. Social conformity. Group think.\nPeople are incentivized to game the system: write a grant that gets them funding so they can get tenure and support their families.\nThe incentive to be innovative is small, though intellectual curiosity powers through for some. The incentive to stay in line and do what’s necessary to get approved is strong.\nWe’ve also learned as a consequence of 2020-2022 that a lot of scientists can indeed be wrong. Today science is becoming less about discovering truth and more about people owning their truth…people love their politics.\nWhat makes a scientist anyway? Am I a scientist because I’m a data scientist? Because I studied statistics? I’ve never published an academic article in a journal, so is that the threshold?\nI think someone who pursues truth through repeatable experimentation is a scientist. Back in Plato’s day they were just called philosophers.\n\n\nToday’s Incentives\nThere’s a reason really smart people now work at Apple to invent the iPhone, Facebook to work on LLMs, and SpaceX to build rockets. The freedom they feel at these companies is empowering. Per “Scientific Freedom”, if the trends continue then people like Max Plank would never have been able to get the funding needed to invent what he did. Where’s the money? Social media. Advertising. And now, AI.\nPeople will always be inventive. But it’s by removing the social barriers that they become so.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

The kweskar are incredible. The four different return voyages home.\n\n2024-02-14\n\nCape horn! Crazy.\n\n\nThe Scottish man you’re referring to is Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean, now known as Robinson Crusoe Island, part of the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile. Selkirk lived alone on the island from 1704 to 1709. His story is believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe’s novel “Robinson Crusoe.” Selkirk was a skilled navigator and sailor, and his survival skills, including hunting, gathering, and shelter building, allowed him to survive until he was eventually rescued by an English ship. His experience highlights the human capacity for adaptation and survival in extreme conditions.\n\n\n\n\nThe Wager\n\n\n2024-02-08\n\nbodysnatchers - total lack of freedom\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Those who embrace it, like those who embraced electricity over steam power, will have to reinvent their businesses from the ground up. They should do so by thinking about The core principles of their business and what’s a judgment and what’s a decision. They can become far more efficient by abandoning rules and procedures and instead focus on decisions. They can automate certain decisions using data.\nThose who go to market to collect data first have a huge advantage. It’s the reason Google has outperformed Bing for a decade - it gets better data and feedback and uses that to make the product more efficient. Data collection is essential to a great data product - not only the data you begin the project with, but the data that brings it to life.\nWhat will I do differently? I’ll try to think more systemically about how organizations I work in are operated by human judgment that can be automated. The book provides a framework for approaching such systemic shifts.\nI’m also interested to see what they’d write about today’s day and age, as this was published right as ChatGPT came out and is now changing a lot. That being said, I think the main principle of decomposing the business into its central parts still stands as the thesis of the book.

Herbert has a way of revealing things he narrates, observations, but holds the conclusions and insights to the individuals.\nMakes you feel like you have superpowers as you read it. Am I a Fremen? An Atreities? It’s fun to read and consider.\nThought provoking. Concepts of politics, religion, science, and diplomacy. War, worms, and wonder. Great read.\n\n\nMovie reactions to a friend:\n\nthe ending of the bad guys is anti-climactic, but I read the books and it’s pretty similar. Rabban doesn’t really even die. Feyd Rautha dies how he does in the book. The death of the Baron is far more interesting in the book, which I won’t spoil but it’s a whole subplot they couldn’t fit in\n\n\nThe symbolism is more that they all scoffed and scorned a 15 year old boy as not being worth anything. The theme of the baron being over confident that there aren’t fremen, that by leaving Paul in the desert he’d die with his mom, etc. they all felt untouchable. Then they all die unceremoniously and their power is just stripped away in a moment. Symbolic of Paul’s rise as a messiah and how these big leaders have very little keeping them from being humanized and debased.\n\n\nFrank Herbert’s theme when he speaks about the book is that “beware of leaders. Don’t trust any of them. Don’t worship them - they’re just humans”. And I think the unceremonious death kind of enshrines that. The baron who was rising over the Duke, dies face down in the dirt. Feyd Rautha who killed an Atreides in the coliseum dies in front of none of his people, etc.\n\n\nIt’s anti climactic but I think it speaks a lot to the theme of how majesty is kind of a thin veil.\n\n\n\n\nDune\n\n\n\nshield your son too much and he’ll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny\ndeprogram after the machines. Let the machines do too much thinking.\nhumans must never submit to animals\n“how did the woman seal my tongue?” Paul can’t tell his father he’s going to die. Why? Sometimes our tongues are bound to speak that which can’t be changed\n“the mind commands the body and it obeys. It commands itself and it rebels”\n\nConnections: - Alan Pinkerton killers “secrets break the character of the criminal till they give it out”. Dr Yueh cries when his scripture is given out.\nNotes: - if I made him do it it wouldn’t be his doing. - storytelling: why tell us 100% of everything up front? The movie hides the secrets about Yueh. - storytelling: the hindsight narrator\nWhen God has appointed a man to die, he guides his wants to desire that place\n\nyou’re remembered for what you fear\nFocusing too much on sight dulls the other senses\nWe became weak on caladan\nWhy beat yourself up after an emotional experience? What does it take to relevel yiur head.\n“Their minds rejected what they could not comprehend or encompass”\nTaking and giving force. a man loves the taking force, but he can’t get into the giving force without being changed.\nPower changed Muaddib to not care about lost people. Why is that?\n\nStorytelling - How he explains their thoughts after subtle observations. He explains things through humanity, not through narration alone. This makes those points more salient. It’s as if the dialogue is the content and the narration are the footnotes and context.\n\nStilgar becoming a worshipper.\nHaving lived billions upon billions of lives. Known cruelty.\nTrying to prevent the jihad, does he inevitably create it?\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Products I enjoy as a dad\nThird times a charm - I hope by(/if) kid number four I’ll have this all figured out. It’s amazing how I feel so new to it all despite raising two kids in the last five years. In starting fresh a third time I feel inspired to write down some things I’m rediscovering.\nTo anyone getting started on their baby journey, perhaps these suggestions can help. Your baby is definitely different than mine, so your mileage may vary! But since I’m still using this stuff five years later maybe it can help you too. Either way, congrats and good luck!\n\nProducts I still use on baby 3\nSince I’m a mega influencer (on my very established data science blog here), I get paid $500 every time you click a link below. So please, go crazy.\nI’ll also credit my wife for figuring out to buy these products in the first place.\n\nStretchy swaddle, like this. I like stretchy swaddles because they’re forgiving. The cotton muslin swaddles are nice and soft, but if the fabric doesn’t stretch the right way you may have to redo the swaddle.\nOllie swaddle (nighttime). This thing is ridiculously overpriced for a swaddle. $70? Don’t get it. But if you do, I like it because its super easy to put on and very sturdy (hard for baby to break). At month 2 the baby gets strong and the basic swaddles are so easy to break. That and I feel like I’m gonna hurt my kid if I try to make a cotton swaddle unbreakable. Enter Velcro! I can be gentle on the swaddle but have it be unbreakable. There are a lot of random contraption swaddles that tie the baby up like a pretzel. This is your classic burrito. Insert baby, wrap right side, Velcro left side and you’re done.\nUbbi Steel Odor Locking diaperpail. I also hated the thought five years ago of shelling out $70 for a trash can. Five years since and the thing still performs. I know how well it’s working when garbage day rolls around and I open it to change it. Smells like a gentle coastal breeze, maybe. To this day my wife hasn’t changed it more than a time or two because thankfully I have an iron stomach and unfortunately she does not. Point is: it keeps the diaper smell inside (for the most part) and uses normal garbage bags (cost saver).\nBaby K’tan Original Baby Wrap Carrier, Infant and Child Sling. I’ve tried several carriers. Boba wraps take way too much patience to learn how to put on (patience I ran out of quickly as a new dad). This thing is just two circular fabric swaths, which means it takes two seconds to throw on. The convenience is huge - baby crying? Grab the carrier and snuggle up in 10 seconds or less.\nDockATot Deluxe+ Dock. We just got one off Facebook marketplace for $50 for third kid. We got it because let’s be real - sleeping is hard. The hardest thing about sleeping is the uncertainty what’s happening on the other side of the room in the crib. Grunting. Coughing. Is baby waking up? Needs a pacifier? When it’s 5am and you’re on feeding three of the night, being able to just roll over and plop the little one into the co-sleeper and monitor the situation close up is nice.\n4moms rockaRoo Baby Swing. There are a thousand ways to solve the “where do I put my baby while cooking dinner” problem. We’ve liked this one.\n\n\n\nMust Haves\n\nDish soap. Honestly, nothing gets out a blowout stain like dish soap. That and drying in the sun is a miracle worker. (Apparently this is how cloth diaper people do it.)\nApple cider vinegar for diaper rash. Once the little pimples appear, you’ll try anything to get them to go away. We just discovered this hack recently and I was delightfully surprised how easily it worked.\nThis is the right way to carry a car seat. A friend of mine that has three kids didn’t know this was a thing until he saw me do it. It’s a thing. Do it! Your forearm will thank you.\n\n\n\nToddler Time\nDown the road, these products have hit home runs for me.\n\nMunchkin Miracle 360 Trainer Cup. Every time I put this cup together I consider applying to Munchkin for a job to be their sales rep. This company has very clever designs on their products and this one just crushes it for me. Acts like a normal cup. Performs like a sippy. (I’ll admit I’ve taken a few swigs out of this just to understand how it works!)\nContigo Spill-Proof Kids Tumbler. I think we have 80 water bottles in a junk drawer somewhere. Cheap ones. Expensive ones. They all end up scattered in pieces like the zebra herd before the lion that is your innocent child. This cup is no exception: I’ve lost a straw on one already. But! If you want a water bottle you’ll have the problem of spare parts. (Uhh, this isn’t a recommendation so far…) So why this cup? This cup is just good. I don’t know. It’s easy to assemble and clean (wide top). Doesn’t spill. Kids like straws?\n\n\n\nBooks\nNot that you’ll have time to read…\n\nThe Happiest Baby on the Block; Fully Revised and Updated Second Edition: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer. I’m sure there’s a quick YouTube video showing the 5 ways to sooth a baby. (Here’s an article.) But if you like books this is a good one. TLDR: sucking, swaddle, shushing, swinging, and side are all soothing to a crying baby.\n1-2-3 Magic: Gentle 3-Step Child & Toddler Discipline for Calm, Effective, and Happy Parenting. This is for toddlers, but I’ve learned this technique has been very helpful for giving me sanity in the terrible two phase. The approach doesn’t always work, but I’ve learned when it does, which is important. TLDR: don’t talk (engage in debate) with your toddler or show emotion when they’re misbehaving. Count them when they do bad acts. That’s 1. That’s 2. That’s 3. Break time. The book explains the method. YouTube is probably a friend here too.\n\n\n\nFinal word\nFatherhood has pushed my limits in all the ways. But I thank God every day I’m a dad. I do a nightly gratitude journal of my favorite moments of the day. If I’m paying attention during the day, at night it’s always my kids that have brought me the happiest moments and greatest joys of the day.\nJust remember: the clothes/products/trips are like the tools used to construct a fine painting. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what tools you use. Nobody cares and neither will you. It’s the output that matters most. I’ve found by just really paying attention to and getting curious about my kids in any moment helps me see the beauty of it all, while distractions cause me to think I need this or that be a better dad.\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "There was a moment when I had everything to lose. When I was junior in high school, I was scared I’d be cut from the lacrosse team. There was only one coach and he didn’t have space for everybody. Coach held try outs.\nMy dad was traveling the week of try outs. I gave him a call. “What if I don’t make the team?”\nHe waits till I finish. And in a way characteristic of my Dad, he re-emphasizes the question. “What if? You go out there, you play your hardest, you give it your all. The rest is out of your hands. If you get cut, you get cut.”\nHe didn’t give me false praise or reassurance. He gave me perspective on life. He gave me “nothing to lose.”\nI never worked harder in my athletics than that week. I just didn’t want to get cut.\nWell, I passed try outs. So did everyone else because it was just a coaching trick to motivate us…but that’s beside the point. But my dad’s advice was never lost on me.\nI had low confidence the whole season. Yet my coach took a surprising interest in me. I got playing time as a junior. I was a part time defender.\nLittle did I know, nor could I ever have imagined as a defender who could barely pass or catch, that in my coach’s last game, I would be sitting on the wrong side of the field. I would be standing, as a defender, right in front of the opposing team’s goalie crease. I’m not quite sure how I got there as the whole season I always sprinted off the field whenever we transitioned from defense to offense.\nMy coach always yelled at me. “Stay on the field!! It’s a fast break!” But I was always terrified of dropping the ball. I was great at defense. Great at scooping the ball. Great at passing it to an offender. This was my safe place.\nYet here I was, in the final minutes of the game. We had three, they had five. And I’m on the crease. What was I doing here?\nMy eyes and voice called to my teammate who saw me. My teammate who knew full well I had no intention of actually catching the ball. My teammate who would love to pass it to me if he had any assurance I’d actually catch it. I could see his eyes lock with mine and it only takes 8 years playing a sport to recognize that split-second glance, “Are you going to actually catch this?” My eyes asserted in that moment with my stick extended and ready “I really don’t know. But I’m wide open and I’m on the crease. And you have the defender and not me. So make a call.”\nTo my surprise he actually passed it. It didn’t have to be a just perfunctory vanity motion to please the coach. Because I’ve called for the ball many times in that wrote script, “oh please pass it I swear it’s worth all our time okay I did my thing now you guys go score because I’m outta here!”\nI catch. I turn. I dunk. 4-5.\nWhat just happened?\nI asked Teddy later why he actually passed it to me. “I figured, what the heck? Maybe he’ll catch it!!” We both laughed. He had nothing to lose.\nI didn’t know it then, but it was the last goal anybody would score for my coach. It was the last game of the season. The last game of his 35 year career at our school. I was wholly undeserving.\nAnd that’s when you stand most to gain.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Imagine the following story:\n\n“In recent events, a ferocious fox savagely attacked a Turkey, who fortunately was able to escape to safety by pecking out the fox’s eyes.”\n\nSimple story. A bit gruesome. But, what in today’s news cycle is positive? How can we be better readers of the news when it’s targeted at making us angry?\nFoxes and turkeys are highlighted in the news all the time and it’s often the worst of humanity. The goal of many authors is to evict emotion from you so you’ll keep reading. Anger. Fear. Worry. Those keep you hooked.\nWhat’s the author’s motive? Often we have to guess it. Wouldn’t it be nice instead if authors were transparent about why they were writing a story:\n\nAuthor 1: I’m a Turkey conservationist with a passion for protecting turkeys from the rampant fox problem we have. Growing up, a Turkey saved my life when I was drowning in a lake.\nAuthor 2: I’m a narcissist who hates foxes because one time they ate my cat. I really just need therapy, but I can’t fathom talking to anyone about my problems. I want you to be as angry as I am.\nAuthor 3: I’m here to get promoted and if my boss sees that I have a 10% increase in viewership then our company’s bottom line increases.

    "text": "One of the most important asset a company wields is its culture.\nA culture is hard to define, but you know it when you see it. It’s the collective personality and written and unwritten rules of engagement. Since corporate employment is a social contract of two at-will parties, the culture emerges from the rules of conduct in which the employer is satisfied with continuing employment of the employee.\nValues are lip service without implementation. Assume your company has the value “be kind”. Everyone has a different interpretation of what that means to them.\nHow do you know what a good culture is? People know the values of the culture and can highlight practices examples of it. The culture should live naturally, but also mechanically. Meaning, an employee will be kind while holding the door open for someone (be kind), but also provide explicit growth-oriented feedback.\nSigns of a bad culture are therefore evident in the opposite of my definition. Like Lord of the Flies, employees are fending for survival and constantly exploring the boundaries because there are now rules of government. Employees that can’t recount what the values are or demonstrate how the company mechanically employs them are hoping for natural demonstration but get confused when they get mixed signals.\nToxic cultures can achieve financial success. “Toxic” has no concrete definition, but probably reveals people trying to survive on the island rather than thrive in a civilization. It stands, therefore, that a great culture will endure the battles of business, and come out tighter. At some point it won’t matter how bright your people are, how clever your IP is, or how many customers you have: culture is the rudder.\n\n\n\nA small boat with a large rudder will get where it needs to go.

    "text": "Interpretation matters\nFirst, we see the (Intercept). This is the average value of a car for every level of every feature not show. So it represents the average price of a year 2000 with 0 miles, Limited trim, without all wheel drive. This allows us to now see what the average effect of, say, year is, holding all else constant. Every unit is in terms of dollars, so we can see that for as.factor(year)2013 that 2013 cars are worth $1,267 more than 2012 cars. This makes sense.\nI scaled mileage to be in the thousands so that it’s a little easier to interpret. So we see that for every 1,000 miles you drive a Ford Edge, it decreases the value of the car by $91 dollars. This tells you a few things. One, if I’m being offered two cars that are 10K miles different, there should be about a ~$900 difference in the car.\nSecond, if I’m planning on driving my car 30k miles over the next two years, how much should I expect the price to drop just due to mileage? Well, about -$91 * 30 = -$2,730. And maybe if you bought a 2014 model, two years later it could perhaps be like owning a 2012 model today. What’s the two-year difference between a 2014 and a 2012 model? About $3,160 dollars."

    "text": "Inference\nNow it’s getting interesting! You’re now starting to remember how your mom told you to never buy a car new, because once you drive it off the lot, it’s worth significantly less. Well, we can see that if you own a brand-new 2017 model and a 2016 model, they’re about $9082 - $6166 = $2916 different. So yea, just by getting the 2017 model you’ll lose $3,000 in the first year. See how 2016 is only $502 dollars more than the 2015? Having the 2015 model is practically the same price as a 2016. So you might as well buy the 2016 model and save a year of wear.\nWell, my theory kind of starts breaking down because 2015 cars and 2014 cars are similarly spaced as 2014 and 2013 ones. So maybe I shouldn’t read too much into this. But the ability to see these trends shouldn’t stop you from asking important questions, like, why is there a difference between years?\nWhen investigating the Nissan Murano, I observed a $5430 difference between 2015 and 2014. That’s non-trivial considering the other years were equally spaced. Doing a little research I saw that Nissan changed the 2015 Murano style, and the new style was apparently worth a lot more. Turns out the same thing happened here for the Ford Edge - the 2015 model is slightly longer with redesigned interior.\nYou can also use this framework to get a decent sense for what features are important to you. Like, is having all wheel drive really worth $1,277? If you live in an area where it snows, it probably is. But if you live in Florida, you may not need it.\nNot only is this framework helpful for comparing within-make-model differences, it helps you get a sense of between-make-model differences. Say, comparing the Ford Edge with the Nissan Murano and the Toyota RAV4. The coefficient for milage on the Edge is -$91. On the Murano it’s -$83, and on the RAV4 -$61. Remember this is the cost per 1,000 miles. That tells me that if I ‘spend’ 30k miles on a car over two years, I’ll lose -$2,730 on the Edge, but only -$1,830 on the RAV4, saving me $900. This also validates that Toyotas hold their value more."

As George Box said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” But here are some quick ways to improve this model:\n\nCheck for interactions. An interaction between miles and year would tell you whether the effect of miles would change across different years. For example, I think adding 10k miles to a 2017 would devalue the car more steeply than adding 10k miles to a 2012 model. During my quick research I checked for interactions, but I didn’t find many to be significant and I chose to ignore them for simplicity.\nUse a linear trend for year rather than a ‘factor’ trend. I’ve chosen here to treat year as a factor, which implies that I think that each year is completely different. Had I used year as a numeric feature, I could have possibly interpreted year as, “Each additional year increases/decreases the price by X on average, holding all else constant.” I liked the simplicity of thinking that each year was different, and since cars usually update models every four years, I wanted to be able to see where this happened. You couldn’t easily see this if year were a linear trend. Objectively, what would be a good way to choose? Fit both models and see which had better R-squared or AIC.\nDo model diagnostics. Check the residual plot to make sure the errors are normally distributed. Check for outliers. Each of these affects the accuracy of your residuals. I did some brief checks and was genearlly satisfied."

    "text": "Takeaways\nSo, a data scientist walks into a dealership with a computer with a registry of thousands of used cars on it. He negotiates with the front-office salesman. And the salesman says…\n\nNon-statistical considerations\nWhen you’re buying a car from a dealership, remember that it’s their job to sell you that car. Here are other random things I learned to think about during the car-buying process.\n\nHow many miles has it been driven, and how old is it? (We found a car with 45,000 miles in one year. That’s almost two trips around the entire world in a year! This is also 3750 miles per month (a cross-country US trip), or about 125 miles per day. What kind of driving do you have to do in a year to get that?\nHow many prior owners were there?\nWas the car previously a rental? A lease? A fleet?\nRental: Abused by X number of people? But also perhaps better maintained by rental companies?\nLease: What kind of person would lease?\nFleet: Probably a corporate car. Like a rental, but different kind of drivers.\nWhere did the car come from?\nIs there snow where they live? And do they use salt on the roads there? (Salt = rust underneath)\nWhat else does the geography tell you about the possible wear on the car (causing long-term problems)\nWhat does the CarFax or Autocheck say?\nWas the car sold at auction? When? What could the time between sales tell you about the car?\nIf someone gets into an accident and doesn’t report it, the CarFax won’t tell you. I drove 45 minutes to look at a ‘great’ deal only to learn the door was nearly falling off.\nGood luck haggling the dealer down. Car dealerships don’t usually make that much on the car, but make their money on warranties and fees. Your best chance is to haggle on the deals being offered (terms and agreements).\nDon’t get the powertrain warranty. This is like the “french fries” of the auto industry. Pure profit.\nEvery dealership has quota. Going in at the end of the month might help you, but the dealership will be packed.\nUsed cars are bought at auction. Carmax buys all their cars at auction and only keeps 1/3 of them. Local dealers also get their cars this way, and they don’t always know what the car looks like till it gets to their lot. Check the Carfax to see if any prior dealers ‘flipped’ the car quickly.\n\nUsed cars have a shelf life. If a car isn’t sold in 45-60 days, some dealerships might have to auction off the car. That means you’ll see a tiering in the price. Less-favorable cars will see the price drop several times in its life cycle. Check CarGurus to see how many times the price has dropped, and try to guess for yourself if it might drop again (or just get sold). They know their prices. They’ve got their back-office guys looking at every price of every same car within 100 mile radius. While I’m also able to get as many of those cars as available on TrueCar, I’m not able to segment by all the various features. It’s easy to webscrape for Make, Model, Year, AWD/FWD, and maybe V6 engine, but it’s very hard to get the details like leather, sunroof, twin-turbo, etc. That’s where the pricing gets really interesting.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nUltimately, a car is bought by irrational humans, and sold by more experienced ones too. So all of this data will probably go out the door when you try to make a deal.\nSo a data scientist walked into several dealerships, and left frustrated because nobody budged on their prices. Doesn’t matter how much data I have, or what I think I know, everyone’s got their price."

Because nobody gets paid after 30 seconds.\n\nApple’s decision made artists want to have more interesting 30 seconds in the iTunes Store\nThat evolved into: an artist doesn’t get paid if you don’t listen at least 30 seconds. And they don’t get paid any more if you listen 31 or 900 seconds. In fact, they get paid more if you listen to two songs, 30s a piece.\n\nSpotify, Amazon, YouTube, Apple, etc all pay based on views. They each define views their own way, but they need to negotiate with the labels who already decided to agree to Apple’s 30s schemes in the early 2000’s. They may have different payment schemes, but some have a scheme of “take all revenue, distribute it according to the artist’s share of views.” So if I pay $10/mo for Spotify and don’t use it, my money goes to someone I didn’t listen to.\nSo how do small artists compete? They’ve got to build their following. Proportionally, the major artists (rather, their labels) soak up all the streaming royalties.\nWhat would be more fair is if my $10 went to the artists I actually listened to, as if I bought their music.\nWhy does any of this matter? Algorithms. Optimization. Monetization.\nIncentives drive outcomes. How we designed our music payment incentives altered music forever (try to be super catchy for 30s). Now, with AI, music can be created much faster which will dilute the pool.\nIn the end, one simple decision changed billions of lives. 30s? That’s all you need to get paid.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

How will I ever sort through all this mess?\nThankfully, most of the things don’t need to get done and are either “eventually” or “someday maybe” tasks, and not “asap” tasks. So just ignore them.\nAnd secondly, I always “know” what’s most important. This documentation process doesn’t change that. It just helps me to get all the distractions out of my head and down on paper.\nSpending time organizing all this stuff seems like a potential waste. But what I realize is that it improves my just-in-time recall. If earlier in the day I planned to buy a dish scrubber in the evening, when the evening rolls around that task magically comes back to my mind. So it’s really just front loading all the decision making and prioritizing. I think our brains are capable of more subconscious processing than we realize.\n(Pause entry to buy dish scrubber…) okay, I’m back.\nAnother idea that’s having an effect on me is the 2 min rule. If a task takes less than 2 min, don’t organize it. Just do it. Powerfully, this mindset helps me to care less about two min tasks. Or, sometimes there’s a tendency to over exaggerate the stress something will cause. Like buying a scrubber could be a 10 min task if you want to find the perfect one. But if you only allocate yourself 2 min, you realize this is only a $6 decision and I have better things to do with my time.\nLastly, I love being deliberate about tasks by writing down the intended outcome of a task. It’s very easy as a data scientist to get swallowed up in all the weeds. Or, rather, when your task is to dig up a gem it’s easy to get distracted by all the weeds that need to be pulled that are in your way. So by being clear about the reason I’m diving into the data in the first place helps me re-surface less scathed. Data are a dirty business…\n\nTakeaways\nThe effect of the GTD framework?\n\nLess FOMO. By writing down everything I can see clearly that 1) I don’t have time for all of it and 2) the stuff I care about pops up.\nI don’t have to worry about what I’m not doing because I can easily say no to it as I say yes to something better.\nI can see broader connections between a litany of things. This helps me prioritize what my subconscious has been telling me by nagging me about X ideas.\nIf I start working on something not in my list it makes me ask if this thing is fealty worth my time when I know I have a ton of other stuff to do. (Recency bias I spoke about in my other blog post.)\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Visible’s party pay madness\nVisible wireless offers $25 off to users who join a party. So a user who signs up to pay $50 for unlimited data can click one button to join a party and only have to pay $25/mo from then on. Why not just offer users $25 to begin with?\nIt’s really confusing to me as a user - why not just give me the $25 automatically if it takes nothing to join a group? Because of gamification.\n\n\nWhy it works\nI think their strategy is as follows:\n\nThey hope some people get brought in on marketing and never remember to activate a party pay. Let’s say this number is 20-40%. Perhaps these users fund the rest of the discounts.\nJoining a party pay group for free is an easy way to make your customers win. I.e., a user gets $25 off for joining. Gimmicky, but I think it works. So a user has an immediate sense of gratification - a great way to build a strong emotional bond. “Click a button to get $25 off in perpetuity? Nice!” Anyone would agree this feels better than just starting off with $25.\nThis makes users want to share and tell others. Especially if customers feel they’ve gamed the system. Who today doesn’t like a hack?\n\nBut even if (1) is wrong, and that 95% of people join a party I’m sure they’ve done the math to consider how many people they need to sign up to make the money work.\n\n\nThe Larger Strategy\nWhy would Verizon cannibalize their own sales? I switched my wife out of a $70 unlimited plan on Verizon to a $25 plan on visible for the same service. Well some customers will stay with Verizon because of its prestige and the add on benefits. But users who are cutting the cord are going somewhere else, I’m thinking Verizon wants to stay ahead of the curve. It’s a race to the bottom, sure. But it doesn’t hurt to try to win the race.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "section": "A treatise on desire, uncertainty, commitment, and execution toward a goal.",
    "text": "A treatise on desire, uncertainty, commitment, and execution toward a goal.\nDescartes proposed that if you pick a direction and walk in a straight line you’ll eventually leave the forest. This assumes you want to leave the forest.\nA desire is a persistent yearning. Desires take root and, when nurtured, become reality.\nAn achieved desire is a blend of hope, faith, and charity. A hope (goal) is the edge of the forest. Walking is faith (belief + action). Charity is long suffering and persistence - the ability to maintain hope and faith.\nA hope is envisioned or observed. If observed, there is believed certainty in achievement, with uncertainty in the path. An envisioned hope has uncertainty in both the path and the outcome. You might die trying. Envisioned hopes are impossible only when the path is not made clear. Thought makes the path clear.\nA clear path is a plan. A plan is a sequence of informed choices and actions leading towards a goal, a consequence. A causal effect. Reconnaissance is the finite time and energy spent collecting information. Reason invites spending time and energy proportional to the cost or impact of the plan and goal. Judgment determines which choices and actions are taken.\nCommitment is recognizing many roads lead to Rome, and only one of them can be walked to actually get there.\nLuck is unknown things. Some things could have been known with more reconnaissance. Other things could never have been known or anticipated. Luck either enables or disables the path. Luck happens post plan, post deliberation. It’s the unknown distance between you and the forest’s edge. Hindsight bias is the present mind’s ability to mistakenly believe uncertainty was always certain. “I should have known” is an oxymoron.\nEnabling luck makes possible the goal. Disabling luck makes difficult the goal, perhaps impossible. Impossible is usually a state of mind or the laws of physics, but usually never both.\nTilt is the mist of blindness caused by the presence of luck. Tilt distracts from information and commitment, a bias caused by observed outcomes that were previously uncertain.\nCommitment is time and energy. Time is measured by rotations of the earth or attempts made. Energy is measured by willingness to roll the dice again.\nCommitment is also reconnaissance. More actions, more information. Ignorance is choosing not to see the information. Stubbornness is seeing it, and maintaining the status quo for thrill of ego. Humility is hunger for more information.\nUncertainty invites fear and worry. Perceived time spent amplifies fear and worry. Uncertainty in the path. Uncertainty in the destination, etc.\nA plan is the process of committing to something knowing that hindsight bias creeps in with each step. The plan mitigates the drag of hindsight bias.\nFear and anxiety are compounded when accomplishment doesn’t happen within perceived time. Human nature is to lose all track of time when in a task, so time should be planned for. Time to evaluate the plan and assess new information should also be decided in the plan.\nCommitment to the plan is a recognition of the infallibility of human emotion. Judgment is evaluating if the plan could be improved, and the plan includes time/effort-base checkpoints for evaluation. Commitment is the recognition that, while the direction you’re heading may not be the right one, (shortest path between you and the edge of the forest which you can’t know at onset), walkikg straight is better than circling from changing direction multiple times. Straight lines are incapable of not exiting. Circles may exit but are capable of not exiting.\nIf new information overrides understood information at the time of the plan, and changes the decision that would have been made given the circumstances at the time of the plan, then wisdom and humility is the ability to change direction despite how many miles walked (sunk cost).\nWalking in a straight line in business is “walking in accordance to the plan”. The time spent deliberating the plan should be proportional to the costs and benefits of the action, which requires judgment. Inspiration is praying that God will guide you and enable your plan.\nArrogance is believing you have infinite energy and time. Optimism is appreciating that any mile walked strengthens your legs, that the direction you chose may not match the imagined ideal. Self awareness is appreciating that the human mind is capable of any imagination, and few imaginations consider accurately all costs or benefits of reality. Imaginations are powerful, but can cause circling, and are most powerful during the plan. After the plan, use imagination to accomplish it. Before the plan, use imagination to design it. But don’t use imagination during the plan to redesign it, I.e, avoid circling.\nAction gets stuff done."

Meaning, if you have some data on your customers (what they purchased and when), you would hope that there’s some rules that your customers are operating under. If you knew their income, their budget, their preferences, etc then you can guess how much they have to spend at a given time. Thus, if you know how much gas is in their tank, the mileage of the vehicle, the MPG of the vehicle, you can predict when they’ll stop to fill up on a road tip. When they fill up, they generate some data. “Bob purchased $34.52 of gas on Monday at 5:43pm.” Why did they purchase at that time of day? And why did they spend exactly $34.52?\nIf all you have outcome/results data then you can’t ever make predictions. But if you know what type of car Bob drives, how often he drives, how much gas he had in the morning when he left his house, etc, you can start to predict when he’ll next fill up.\nThe assumption behind a model is that what was true in the past will remain true in the future.\nWhy have there been so many issues because of COVID? Nobody could have predicted a world wide pandemic. The world wasn’t the same. All the models stopped working. Supply chain models. Financial models. Default models.

What would having a PhD give you that I don’t have?\nWell, I trust you more if you had one.\nJeremy Howard, a world renowned research and creator of fast.ai and answers.ai started his lectures on deep learning with “you don’t need to have a math degree, you just need to know a little bit of code”. With that philosophy he’s helped entrepreneurs create amazing products that left his free online program.\n\nBlindspots tho\nConcepts are important to understand. Understanding your training data and how the machines learn from them and the biases they’re prone to is very useful, perhaps mission critical, to creating value.\nSo what’s the line? Well, if you got a PhD you’d probably spend 80% of your time on your dissertation and taking some non relevant coursework. How does that help you today?\nWell, you should learn as many concepts as you can. Like driving a car, you don’t need to know hydroplaning but you should learn hydroplaning. You don’t need to know how to drive in snow but you should know that driving a car in the snow with rear wheel drive is a different experience.\nIf you live in Arizona you don’t need to know how to drive in the snow. Your bias is you’ll never know why that would be necessary.\n\n\nPrinciple\nBe so curious that you explore the boundaries of your space such that you learn “oh, cars work differently in snow, but I don’t have snow so I’m safe”. Once you reach the boundary you probably know enough. Then ship your code and learn by how you messed things up.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Businesses are Launching Like Crazy\nThere’s never been a better time to start a business. The Census shows there are over 200,000 new business applications per month more than pre pandemic.\n\nWhat’s driving this?\nListening to The Unintended Consequences of Working from Home it dawned on me that there’s a hyper acceleration of innovation happening.\nConsider the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and StableDiffusion. Chamath Palihapitiya discusses the expansive applications for these services. What was once SaaS will become MaaS (models as a service). There will be models for everything: copy writing, code debugging, converting wireframes into working apps, ad generation, book writing…\nWhile tools like ChatGPT are just in demo mode, it’s wildly apparent they’ll be an impetus for new ideas and reducing the friction of getting to the answer. For example, as a data scientist if I need boilerplate code to clean some data, I can ask ChatGPT for the 80% solution. I’m already spending 30% of my day copying code snippets from StackOverflow and making it work for my problem. ChatGPT will just accelerate that process. 10 years from now if Neuralink can read my thoughts I don’t even need a keyboard to do this…we’ll build things at the speed of thought.\nConsider this for writers and marketers. They’ll use ChatGPT to unblock them, generate ideas, and get started. Innovation across the board will accelerate because the kinetic friction to getting started will reduce to zero. You can then spend your time on the editing and refining.\n\n\nThe Best Time to Start a Business\nI digress. Why is now the best time to build a software business?\n\nCompute is cheap. Gone are the days of having to build a server to prototype and idea.\nBarriers to prototyping are nearly free and scaling with the cloud is nearly infinite. Consider how the Gas App can launch to 100,000 new users per day with just a few developers.\nModeling is now easy. All cloud services have their own AutoML tools to build machine learning models for you.\n\nThe center of all of this is scalable data infrastructure and AI.\n\n\nFuture of Data Science\nThe data scientist of today may still be using sklearn to manually do hyperparameter tuning, but the data scientist of tomorrow will either be exclusively building MaaS B2B products or be the one person in their organization who will leverage all the MaaS tools.\nIf we can ask ChatGPT for complex answers it learned from the internet, why couldn’t something similar be trained on your company’s internal data? If that’s possible, then why couldn’t you just have a Q&A session with your internal ChatGPT? Consider the following example:\n\n“Hey KITT, what are the user segments generating the most revenue on Tuesdays at 5pm?” (Analytics)\n“How many sales do we anticipate from these users next Tuesday?” (Machine Learning)\n“What ads have been most effective for us in driving new sales in the past 7 days?” (Statistics)\n“Okay, KITT, generate 3 variants of that ad for next Tuesday” (StableDiffusion generating a new Ad)\n“I like ads A, B and C. launch an experiment on Facebook/TikTok, run it for three days and dynamically allocate ad spend to the best ad.” (Business integrations, statistics, ML models)\n\nThe data scientist of the future will be the one with deep understanding of these tools and an awareness of their biases. It will be very difficult to know when they’re lying to you. The in-house data scientist will be keen on knowing the biases in the data fed into these algorithms and how to make judgments on where to go next.\nEarly stage companies won’t need data scientists because most of this stuff will be off the shelf and easy for an engineer to integrate. That means that the data scientists will join these MaaS companies to build out optimized products that solve these niche problems.\n\n\nTakeaways\nData Scientists shouldn’t be scared their jobs will disappear. They should be excited that they’ll be joining companies that automate what they’re currently doing and offer it as a service.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

If it’s not well received, either through attention, clicks, or books purchased, then most people may abandon the idea. Very few (those seeking truth), are staunch advocates of an opinion not popularly received.\nEven unpopular opinion people try out their ideas. They may rise on social media as “they want to cancel me, so trust my opinion”. That sales pitch only lasts so long as you’re a minority.\nPoint is: if your opinion gets reception, you’re less likely to change your opinion. This is a problem in politics for people who espouse something for a long time.\nInstead we should be like Galileo: show me the data.\nSo be cautious if people like your opinion because you may be at risk of not being able to change it, either through your own evolving greed or desire for social acceptance and popularity.\nThe reception of an idea doesn’t determine its truthfulness, but the ability of the idea to stand on its own.\n\n\n\nLook for the evidence, not the popularity\n\n\nI always try to think about this when listening to a popular author or podcaster: what about their idea has garnered popularity? Have they changed course in the face of evidence? I recall Amy Cuddy having one of the most popular Ted talks on Power Poses, only to have a Slate article come out that refused her research. She doubled down despite her research not being reproducible: the gold standard a scientist should seek.\nFew people are like Amy Cuddy in that their ideas cannot be easily tested and so the world lazily believes them. This is the risk: when people stop thinking for themselves.\nThings why Frank Herbert wrote Dune: to encourage people to think for themselves and not put too much trust in their leaders.\n\n2024-01-17 update:\nChapter 14 of The Quest for Cosmic Justice discusses this way better than I do here.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Even in the tech world of wanting to fail fast, I think most people just really want to win every time. Nobody seeks failure - that’s not the goal. They seek other things (learning, promotions, making more money).\nWhen making decisions, it’s easy to black-and-white them. If there’s only a 3% change we’ll win 5 times in a row (with a 50% chance of winning every time), there’s a 97% chance you’ll fail at least once every 5 attempts.\nIf your probability of success is lower, then the odds of failing at once in five are almost 100%.\nHow do you quantify a life decision though? Maybe you only get one big choice a year (job change, like as is discussed in How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices). Is there a 50% chance of “success”? If so, every five years you’re highly likely to “fail”.\nPer the book, it’s more likely that one bad thing happens and we hindsight bias our decision and black-and-white it.\nReality is: getting fired or your startup blowing up might be the best thing that ever happens to you. You just don’t know. Your story isn’t written yet.

And here’s an example of a digital garden someone uses with quartz, it’s pretty slick. Here are the features of quartz.\nWhy quarto? I really like the design of a blog, as I tend to think better in “post” form rather than never-ending-garden-of-thoughts. I like reading blogs because I assume the thoughts are complete. Quartz is great if you just want your own wiki. I just don’t really care about the network graphs and all and I don’t think other people reading them care either.\nI want to focus on writing and sometimes long form writing. Quarto enables a lot, is easy to setup and customize, has great search, has a ton of markdown desires (tabs, callouts, asides, footnotes), can render code (Python/R) when I want to be adventurous, and has a blog interface for posts.\nLargely they’re the same, and maybe I’ll use quartz at some point.

Users are forever impacted by your choice.\nIf you give out a credit card with $100, $300, and $500 lines, people are going to spend more on the $500 line.

    "text": "The Essence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: The future belongs to those whom it’s always belonged\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blogger data scientist Santiago recently said on Twitter, (paraphrasing) “I’m going to focus on what won’t change”. He was worried about how coding and AI will be automated, but Jeff Bezos wasn’t worried about so much of the world changing with the Internet. Bezos focused on what wasn’t changing.\nThis thought hit me, because I think it’s relevant to what our future looks like in 18 months.\n\n\nEvery day, a new winner\nNothings more apparent that the world is going to be wildly different than the past than to hop on X and see new academics one upping themselves with the next greatest LLM. Mistral just announced a 2Bn valuation as a 6 month old company. Fast is the new pace. And it’s oddly the case that big businesses are capable of massive disruption from upstarts. They can’t afford to stay glacial much longer (5-10 years).\nWith all of this, what about this blog post won’t change? Well, the timeless principle is that the nature of the game has changed permanently. Pandora’s box was opened.\n\n\nThe rise of a new equalizer\nGo into a poor part of town and you’re guaranteed to see one thing: poor people using smart phones.\nThey have access to all the same information that the rich people have. The same excellent software. Same excellent hardware. All for a fee of $50/mo for the hardware and $25/mo for an unlimited data plan.\nSo that out the rich and the poor on the same level.\nWell now, knowledge and reasoning is as accessible as Google Maps. You don’t have to pay $20/mo for ChatGPT plus. You can use Bing, Claude.ai, bard.google.com, You.com, or perplexity.ai for free. Now.\nSure people hate on bard and want to use the latest and greatest. But even the crappiest of the four I mentioned above (granted Bing/You.com use GPT in the background), is still leaps ahead of where we were just a year ago. If we were stuck only using one of these tools forever we’d still be massively more productive than not.\nSo knowledge and intellectual reasoning is going to be commonplace amongst the plebes.\n\n\nif you value intelligence above all other human qualities, you’re gonna have a bad time\n\n— Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) October 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\nMore of the same\nSo…what’s going to happen? Well, I’m not sure human nature will change much.\nThey say “being rich doesn’t make you happier. It just makes you more of what you already were before being rich”.\nAnd so, the mentally poor will remain so. They’ll use AI for entertainment. Better video games. Better, faster content. More consumption.\nThe creatives will be more creative. Nobody will be at a barrier of being silo’d. So what if you’ve only done data science for 10 years. You know coding. It’s easy to now do web design. Or copy writing. Or art. Or…\nAnd I won’t be able to stop the masses from using Code Interpreter to do data science. The systems will only become more powerful, so cloud companies will make it easier to write sql or whatever. Heck, 5-10 years English will be the only programming language. (Who here does firmware/bit mapping anymore? Only a select few.)\n\n\nThe hottest new programming language is English\n\n— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) January 24, 2023\n\n\nPython programmers will become like the engineers who create the seeds. And the rest of us just get bigger, better, and more efficient farms. There will always be those who specialize, as there are people who write compilers today, but fewer and farther between. Perhaps intellectual interest and economic incentives will equalize.\n\n\nFestivus for the rest of us\nCompanies will become smaller. But the same human needs will need to be met:\n\nfood\nshelter\nclothes\nphysical toys\ndigital entertainment\n\nMore people will just be able to do more things. Perhaps there will be more prosperity as a result.\nAnd more people will unionize and try to prevent the change. But that’s a short term thing. Can’t last forever. A union is only as good as it’s needed.\n\n\nTakeaways\nGet ahead by focusing on what’s essential. Leverage what’s around you to develop new skills to prepare for the future. And be excited. It’s going to be a wild ride.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "Blogging with Quarto, and why I don’t use Medium anymore",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Been here before, eh?\nI probably shouldn’t write this post considering I’ve also written posts “blogging with Jekyll”, “Blogdown”, and “distill” before. I’m flaky, what can I say. I’ve changed my blogging framework 7 times in 5 years (I started with blogger.com and Wordpress before Jekyll, and even used Medium for 25 posts.)\nBut it’s not my fault. There are too many static site generators and it seems that Rstudio is as flaky as me. Meaning, they built rmarkdown, created hugodown, blowdown, bookdown, and distill. Hugodown is a lightweight version of blogdown, and I never figured out why it exists. Then there’s workflowr and so many other great, random products out there.\nWhy quarto for me? It seems to have all the stuff that distill has, and then some. And given its design and collaboration with Wes McKinney (pandas guy) in building quarto, and given that Wes wrote his latest book with it, I think this will be here to stay for at least 5 years.\n\n\nWhy do I avoid Medium\nWhy don’t I blog with Medium? I wrote 25 posts there over 9 months and loved it. It makes writing and publishing incredibly easy, which is why I did it. With distill/blogdown the limiting factor was I’d have to be at my computer to get a post in. I love writing on my phone - I have over 2000 journal entries with Day One over seven years, several of which are “draft” posts for a blog that won’t see the light of day since I don’t care about them after I’ve written it. I want to be able to blog frequently, a short little blurb to keep up my writing, and medium enabled this.\nBut 1) I didn’t get many views (not that I care) and 2) my writing is stuck on their platform (confirmed to me this week as I’ve tried several old, broken tools that attempt to export posts out of medium).\nI got 50x the views on my blogdown site just from organic google searching. From reading other people’s posts about leaving Medium, it’s seems that most traffic to Medium posts comes from outside of Medium.\nSo while I’m certainly not into blogging for the money, I wouldn’t mind getting the content to people who it can help. And if medium didn’t enable this, what is its purpose?\nSo I’m back and finally decided that I’m going to own my own platform. Seth Godin wrote a blog about this topic once. Why be on Medium, substack, Facebook, etc or any other up an coming platform? We’ll they’re all skewed toward the 1% of people who make money on the platform. Everyone else is wasting their time. So might as well own your content. And better to focus on writing than waste time catching up on every platform.\nAlso, it’s fun! There’s a fuzzy feeling to blogging.\n\n\nFuture of quarto?\nI’m speculating here, but Quarto can be used withR Studio, Jupiter or VS Code. The last editor seems excitingly suspicious.\nPerhaps R Studio sees the writing on the wall that VS Code is taking over the IDE world and perhaps taking over the long term future of R Studio IDE. I personally don’t see why anyone would pay for R Studio when VS Code is free and has a better interface. And while R Studio has a few better integrations for R at the moment, it won’t once enough people see the light for VS Code and turn their contributions there. I’ve been using R on VSCode for two years now and it rivals R Studio in 95% of the feature set, but 100% has better window management.\nSo Quarto seems like a great opportunity for R Studio to begin monetizing on a publishing platform like R Studio connect. Platforms like Notion and Confluence are great for everyone except data scientists trying to share reproducible research. But a quarto server seems like a great way to finally bring in Python data scientists into the markdown-flavored documentation world. (Man, I personally can’t use Jupyter/Google colab notebooks when I can use R Markdown!) I’d heartedly welcome this prospect, though I have no idea what their plans for Quarto really are.\nTill next blog post about what blogging tool I’m going to use…\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "Personal Constitution",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Preamble\nIn the spirit of the book Principles, with a goal toward increased productivity through self-awareness and accountability, I cement here a personal constitution. I publish this publicly for all to read that I might benefit from their feedback.\n\n\nFoundational Principles\nImprovement through self awareness. As perhaps Socrates said, “an unexamined life is not worth living”. To add my own twist: an examined life refines what’s worth living for. Like a chef with a fine palette, a self awareness acquired through reading, personal coaching, cognitive therapy, and above all journaling and hearing yourself talk, refines\nTrust thyself: I can’t grow unless I test my opinions. “Success in life is the result of good judgment. Good judgment is usually the result of experience. Experience is usually the result of bad judgment.” Tony Robbins Alberto Savoia teaches in The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeeds the YODA framework - Your Own DAta. Only your own data is trustworthy. Intuition gets me to the point of knowing what data I need to collect. After intuition, there’s my opinion about what might happen, someone else’s opinion about what might happen, someone else’s data, and my own data. With limited time and the infeasability of collecting omniscient data (discussed in How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices (Annie Duke)), I want to collect as much data as I can from other people’s mistakes by reading and learning. My value to the world, however, will come when I recognize that for a problem at hand that there is either data gathered via the Aristotlean methold of empirical evidence or Socratic method of reasoning by degrees. Judgment is used to determine whether data is worth being collected. In absence of data, “If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine.” Jim Barksdale, CEO of Netscape (Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing). I will be unafraid to share my opinion, even if perceived as stupid or wrong.\nAssume Kindness, Give Kindness, Give and Seek Forgiveness. In a multi-cultural world, it’s hard to know what word might offend someone. I learned this by learning “Honduran” Spanish. The word for “Wednesday” in one culture might be a curse word in another. Inadvertantly, if I’m to share an opinion with the best of intentions, I may offend someone unwittingly due to the way I shared it or the way they interpreted it. Everyone communicates differently. Assume kindness means to assume they don’t intend harm. Give kindness means to speak with good intention. Giving and seeking forgiveness is the process of recognizing that in assuming or giving kindness, I’ll fall short but I can recover and let things go. Regardless of culture, we’re all human and want good feelings. We can operate in a way that cultivates these good feelings - a universal language.\nVulnerability is recognizing weakness, which is the foundation of true, enduring strength. As discussed in Dare to Lead and Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team, teams fail when they’re not vulnerable, vulnerable in the sense that they’re self aware to share their strengths and weaknesses and ask for help in their weaknesses. A toxic environment is one that fails to recognize weakness, because like a limp knee that causes first hip, then shoulder issues appear. A powerful Christian teaching states, “I give unto men weakness that they may be humble;…for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.” (Ether 12:27). From this point of view, weakness is actually a gift. It’s a gift to rely on God (in my opinion, which is most often found in the goodness and grace of others) and ask for help. The Alcoholics Anonymous group recognizes the power of asking for help.\n\n\nPrincipled Behaviors\nOpinions deserve to be dissected, and everyone is filled with biases. Challenging Opinions: Put out opinions, and challenge others’: “Strong opinions, loosely held” is a mantra in tech and means something different to everyone. I interpret this as “everyone has an opinion, most choose to let the most dominant opinion run the conversation”. “strong” means you recognize you actually do have an opinion, even if you don’t care. By sharing an opinion, you’re putting it out there to be challenged. Being willing to change it with new evidence is “loosely-held”. It’s demonstrated in Elon Musk changing his opinion of how to design Starship while talking to a reporter. Speak, be open to challenges, and adjust. If I don’t challenge opinions, I’m at risk of “I told you so” syndrome later, except you didn’t tell them and instead you inflate your internal ego and did nothing to solve the problem.\nChallenge theory, challenge data collection. As discussed in Scientific Freedom (Donald Braben), peer review is dying and failing the scientific process. As discussed in The Coddling of the American Mind (Jonathan Haidt, Greg Lukianoff), cancel culture is crushing open and free discussion, opinions and movements usually driven by cognitive distortions. As demonstrated in The Quest for Cosmic Justice (Thomas Sowell), there is usually strong contra-evidence to very dogmatic political beliefs about “how things should be”. If we reason with evidence like Sowell, challenge our beliefs like Haidt/Lukianoff, and seek to establish real, empirical truth like Braben, we’ll approach problems like Duke by considering all possibilitys, evaluating costs, and challenging internal biases. Data collection is difficult, and the procedures by which you collect data and draw conclusiosn from it must be challenged so that inferences can\nIf I have an issue I’ll bring it to the problem first. If I have a conflict (see next section) with someone, I seek to resolve it behind closed doors first. It takes two people to resolve a conflict. If the conflict cannot be resolved behind closed doors, or repeatedly re-occurs despite my best efforts, I’ll proceed to a more defensive stance, which often resolves in me processing it through journaling.\nIf I sense an issue, I seek to reassure those around me. I’ve been in several great organizations, and several toxic organizations. Once, 2 weeks after joining a team I interviewed everyone on the team. I could tell immediately that 6/12 were incredibly dissatisfied even if they didn’t say it. One of them went so far as to tell me they hated their boss. Within a year, 5/12 had left the team to go somewhere else in the org. On another occassion, I joined a team and within one week of joining, one person asked me to unionize. Again, a lot of discord. Within 6 weeks 10 of the 20 data scientists in the company were fired, including the disgruntled. In a third cirucmstance, a lot of disgruntled employees foment amongst themselves, each trying to solve their problems with management. Management doesn’t recognize even direct requests for changes in behavior. In all three of these circumstances, I work quickly to bring up the issues. I speak directly with management. I speak in the first person, keeping confidences, and only doing so usually at my own personal risk. I try to resolve what I have experienced, and what I have control over. Sometimes, people don’t want to change. Usually this results in failed organizations, but not always. In all three of these circumstances, I have witness failed organizations. The first was in a large organization where the manager got a horrible “do not recommend” rating from their peers. The second was an organization that lost all of its remaining data science talent. The third was an organization that lost multiple long-tenured teammates, even key leaders, that went on to get top jobs at other top companies. Belief: if talent gets a great job at a great company elsewhere, the company is doing something wrong.\n\n\nMy Conflict Style\nConflict, to me, isn’t a dirty word if two people have good intentions. It becomes dirty when both parties have bad intentions. It’s at its worst when one has good intentions and the other has bad.\nAs the youngest child of peaceful parents, my conflict style is to observe and self-reflect.\n\n\nHow I’ll Fail\n\nAfter doing a ton of work on myself, I’ve grown to an awareness of how I operate. There are past scars.\n\nI’ve been told I’m stupid before.\nI’ve been fired before. This leads\nI hyperfocus on the negative.\nI reason by extremes.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Policies are for politicians to pursue power, to win the next vote.\nWhat good does relieving 130bn in university debt do?\nthe argument is that our system is broken. So we’ll fix it with money.\nThe more flawed thinking is that “education is a right.” Should this be true, then food is a right. Then social media is a right. Our phones are a right.\nLife is a right. Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, too.\nBut my decision to go 200k in debt for an investment that didn’t return dividends (hence my inability to pay), is not a right. It’s a poor investment choice.\nSending out money signals a poor precedence, apart from the blatant desire to buy votes. The economics aren’t aligned. The incentives are bad.\n“Go learn about something, investing 4 years, and discover it’s not capable of helping you earn wages” is nothing more than a sabbatical.\nWe need to spend that money incentivizing innovation. Entrepreneurs. People who create value.\nThe “educated” masses (3.6m) who cannot afford to pay their debt, when they scoffed at tradespeople who were employable the moment they finished their 3 week training, and then asked those tradespeople to pay for their schooling, is disappointing.\nWe need to think about incentives, both long and short term.\n\n\n\nAt some level the government stole from the uneducated to pay for the unemployable ‘educated’\n\n\nThe solution: student loan officers should be on the hook to ask “what is your potential income return?” The loan must be payable within 8 years at a 10% additional tax on their wages. They need to be able to survive with this 10% tax, and the 10% tax over 8 years should be sufficient to pay the bills.\nSo if you have a $100k job, that’s $80k education. 10% tax for 8 years is 10k per year to pay the debt.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Judgment is based off reason and gut. Decisions usually rely on gut though. You have to “feel good”.\nI had seen this boss make many decisions without explaining his thinking. “Hold.” Why? The company is tanking per reports. “Sell”, but this one’s looking good!\nThe point is nobody could replicate his decision making.

Any negative situation can be reframed for a positive. This is mindset.\nBut the other component is also important: where your circumstances will take you if pursued every day for the next 30 years.\nIf you’re an extremely happy person but you don’t take action to get out of a minimum wage job, such as spend time on self improvement, you’re going to stay in your minimum wage job (nothing wrong with that, just trying to illustrate a point).\nAnd so, to get what you want out of life you can’t just assume things will get better without any change on your part. You can 1) change your mindset or 2) change your trajectory.\nI’ve wondered whether at times in my career I was complacent or not, or whether I was growing doing what I was doing.

He doesn’t know even whether he’s had his kid or not.\nIn a podcast I listened to lately on happiness, one suggestion was to write out all your goals and cross them off from day one. Pretend like it doesn’t even matter if you accomplish them. This helps free you.\nCareers are like both of these things. We want everything. We can pretend like we have it. We can come to terms with it. And we can say “doesn’t matter if I don’t get that, because I’ve got a life outside my career.”\n\n\n\nWhich path you choose isn’t as important as who you choose as companions\n\n\nConsider your career from your deathbed (My Tombstone). What path did you take that mattered? What were all the alternate realities and multiverses you could have had.\nPut them all together. In one multiverse you’ve been fired. In another you end up getting insanely wealthy. In another you start your own company. In another you become an online blogger.\nAll of them can’t be true when you do this exercise extensively enough. And choosing which one probably doesn’t matter as much (right vs wrong path thinking). If you’ve ever left a job you realize that nothing really comes over with you. Most relationships at work are short lived and contextual, like your relationships in high school. And that’s life.\nHappiness is perhaps being okay with not having everything you desire, except for the few things that are truly attainable: peace with God, self, and cherished relationships.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Self Surveillance\nI came across this article in Flowing Data and thought it was fascinating.\nI’ve been on a productivity kick lately and notice these apps have habit trackers. I’ve tried using them in the past and have realized it gets too much too quickly. But that doesn’t mean as a data guy that I don’t think it’s a cool idea. It just overwhelms me.\nWe’ll I discovered that me tracking a few habits a day is junior varsity level. Felix’s blog is how it’s done to the extreme. Clearly this guy isn’t worried about Big Tech or Big Government harvesting his personal data. I love the boldness!\nThis is just 1/20th of the full page screen shot:\n\nThe number of slices and views he has is endless. It’s crazy to see everything he’s tracking, partly I’m sure because he has fun with it and the other part because he deep down hopes there’s something there.\nHis quote on Flowing Data has stuck with me:\n\nOverall, having spent a significant amount of time building this project, scaling it up to the size it’s at now, as well as analysing the data, the main conclusion is that it is not worth building your own solution, and investing this much time. When I first started building this project 3 years ago, I expected to learn way more surprising and interesting facts. There were some, and it’s super interesting to look through those graphs, however retrospectively, it did not justify the hundreds of hours I invested in this project.\n\nThis guy probably knows himself in a way that none of us ever will. He can’t ever lie to himself and say “yea, I’m good at exercising every day” because he’s got the data to back it up. But is this the life we want?\n\n\nSelf Surveillance as a Service\nSSaaS? Apparently. Exist.io tries to find patterns in your personal data and tell you when your most happy.\n\n\n\nExist.io\n\n\nWhen I researched the Apple Watch team a few years back I came to appreciate what they were/are trying to do: correlate heart monitoring with insurance claims data to proactively identify preemptive signs of cardiac arrest and other health issues.\nThat seems meaningful in theory because information about other people can be correlated with information about me.\nBut does info about myself correlate with info about myself? Probably. I have cycles. I have common traps and pitfalls like any human walking this earth. Some pitfalls are daily, some are quarterly or seasonal.\nBut I can also take 5 minutes to ponder reflectively or talk to a close friend and identify those patterns. What’s more human?\nAnd what’s more: if you end up changing your behavior then your past can’t really predict your future. So all of the data becomes moot once it achieves its purpose: true lasting change. Because if you truly change your behavior based on the insights you glean about yourself, those past triggers and anomalies no longer affect you in the way they did. So when you experience a personal step change in life, you’re a new you. Maybe not. But maybe.\nAlso, the new generations growing up on smartphones have a unique challenge: their online identities are given to them before they’re really conscious enough to determine if that’s what they want to show the world. Parents posting YouTube or TikToks of their kids are cementing for these kids an identity they themselves didn’t choose. We’ve all gone through phases of deleting Facebook photos from 15 years ago because it doesn’t reflect our current self image. What’s to be said of giving people an opportunity to change if everything they’ve ever said or done is recorded somewhere? Twitter. Instagram. TikTok. Facebook. Every post is cementing us in a way.\nI think it’s better to forget yesterday. Because it doesn’t have to have any bearing on where you’re going tomorrow. It can if you let it. But your past doesn’t have to define you.\n\n\nTakeaways\nWould you rather spend hours setting up digital automatic and manual tracking systems just to learn what you could by opening a gratitude journal every day? Sometimes less is more. I don’t think digital self surveillance is a direction we should go. (Not to mention the moment you do get hacked you’ll deeply regret it.)\nEven blogging can be dangerous for your career. Never know what’s gonna come back to haunt you years later.\nSo I should be careful what I say here, that is if I ever care to work for a self surveillance company in the future.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Sometimes by trying to solve a problem we can make things way worse and create all these problems. (Politics?

Ironically, greatness follows those who do, not those who say they will do.\nSo instead of asking “how will others remember me”, ask “what will I do for others?”\n\n\n\nDan Kiefer via Unsplash\n\n\nOn this Christmas season, remember that while Jesus Christ’s divinity has been debated for centuries, certainly he’s been remembered. He’s been remembered because of the actions he took and the kindness he showed.\nChristians believe he was the Son of God, one with literal power over death and rose from his own grave. He could calm the seas and turn water to wine. He was the rightful heir to the throne that his Roman captors sat on. He could have easily freed his oppressed nation to rest on his laurels forever.\nYet the recorded miracles we have from him don’t involve him showing moving mountains or collecting power and gold. The reason he’s remembered is because His miracles involve him spending time with individuals and in their service. He healed the sick. Caused the blind to see. He alleviated suffering.\nMay this Christmas be one where you don’t focus on what others think of you. May it be one where you enjoy following His example of doing good for others, however small.\n\nWhosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. Matthew 20:26–28\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

No provider does both embeddings and inference as a service, which is interesting. - Thoughts on vector DBs Reddit - Dive into anything - Seems cool: Lightning AI, which allows you to do like a repl type solution but for AI. Curious how good the editor is.\nThe Lazy Tyranny of the Wait Calculation - by Ethan Mollick - waiting for tech to be competent to achieve your vision or hop on the train? - I think software will catch up quickly. Our ability to get to a solution faster means faster prototyping, pickier customers, but ultimately more junk. The question of product market fit will always be the question, regardless if you wait. But some ideas may be worth trying a year from now rather than doing all this stuff that will be obsolete with the next AI release. - This blog itself wouldn’t be possible without Obsidian Mobile, free GitHub repos, Working Copy App, and quarto and iOS shortcuts. so the technologies need to converge to enable certain innovations (in this case my peculiar system for how to blog online from my phone)\n\n\n\nDreaming of cloud solutions\n\n\nGPTs won’t make you rich - by Charlie Guo - GPTs are now available.

Don’t tell me the disease ridden McPlay place with its sad meals isn’t to blame too.\nAfter reading The Quest for Cosmic Justice I’ve considered how negative regulation can be. Let’s thought experiment: stop advertising to kids. Well then why not stop advertising to people of any other demographic? Old people are vulnerable too right? Okay so then let’s have free market. Advertise to anyone - okay let’s enable smoking ads again for kids. No that’s not good.\n\n\nYouTube derived the greatest ad revenue from users 12 and under ($959.1 million), followed by Instagram ($801.1 million) and Facebook ($137.2 million). Instagram derived the greatest ad revenue from users ages 13-17 ($4 billion), followed by TikTok ($2 billion) and YouTube ($1.2 billion). The researchers also calculated that Snapchat derived the greatest share of its overall 2022 ad revenue from users under 18 (41 percent), followed by TikTok (35 percent), YouTube (27 percent), and Instagram (16 percent).\n\nOpenAI announces first partnership with a university - education is going to be greatly commoditized. - Academic researchers can enjoy researching again instead of teaching (what some of them are horrid at) - I took an accounting class where half was online, half in person.

    "text": "“Starting a business is like chewing glass” - Elon Musk. Here’s why.\nSilvermine AI took many huge steps forward. Onboarded six customers. Prepped for 5 more deals. Here’s what happens behind the scenes.\nHere’s a list of everything that I did:\n\nMigrate from Outlook to Gmail. Fix my DNs records so I don’t get flagged as spam. My company’s website crashes (it’s okay I’m gonna gut it anyway and move over to what I’m putting my customers on.)\nset up an account for my web dev to build a site for my customer.\nReview my web devs site. Evaluate quality. Find broken links.\nCall 4 people my cold caller found. They’re all interested.\nFollow up text with one. He tries grinding 95% of my margin. I let him. I regret it. Deal falls through anyway. He’s not my target customer.\npost updates on Facebook. Someone I haven’t spoken too in 15 years calls me greedy. I’m working 80 hour weeks with no pay for the next three months c supporting people who are otherwise unemployed. Some people just wanna tear you down. I’ve heard it spoken that when you try to do something, the people not in the arena like throwing boos. But the people on the field respect you. “It is not the critic who counts.” As that quote goes. Dare bravely.\nSend material to my social media manager.\nReview the work she did. Get stoked. She’s crushing it. My clients like it.\nReach out to owner to ask what they want on their website. Don’t hear back. Check in next week I suppose.\nSend out 6 onboarding forms. 3 don’t reply. Check back next week I suppose.\nDiscuss with my ads manager how to do ads. Customer asks me questions. I’m relaying info to my manager. I’m learning. Try to schedule time. Pause writing this because I realize I forgot to schedule that follow up time with my customers.\nMy customers are so busy they don’t have time to respond. I’m so busy trying to remember who I’ve responded to.\nReach back out to 10 warm leads. People interested but too busy to respond. I send out a calendar invite just to see if that’s easier than trying to text them again. It is. The random time I picked didn’t work (as expected). They responded with a better time (amazing). I’m one step closer to helping them get the site they want. Success.\nReach out to a family member who posted on Facebook about their construction business. They knew I stated a business but didn’t know exactly what. We have an hour chat. They realize I may be able to help them. Document new lead. Follow up for Monday.\nThis said family member on my wife’s side is surprisingly a customer of my cousins on my side. Wild. I realize that my cousin is a chiropractor. I could potentially help him build his business. Try calling, out of office. Make a new lead in my CRM. Follow up next Wednesday.\nDo an audit of a site. Send out a response. Didn’t get an answer. Decided instead of texting I’ll do the same thing as above and send another cal invite. Waiting to hear back.\nOne of the four interested cold calls said he was super interested and to call back on Friday. I’m stoked. Then I call back Friday. He says call back in 15. I call back in 45 bc of another meeting. He silences my call and sends me straight to voicemail. I send a text. No response. Follow up one time next week before closing as a lost. People are weird. But I get it. He didn’t recognize our convo from Wednesday. He doesn’t have time to deal with this decision. I know how that goes.\nthird interested guy says he’ll sign up next week once he gets paid. Stoked. Send reminder in CRM. Hopefully he doesn’t forget me like the Friday guy.\nFourth interested guy says to call back in the evening that very same day. He’s stoked. I call back but his daughter broke her arm just hours earlier. Going to hospital. I’m surprised he responded at all. I send him a text the next day wishing his daughter well. I call back two days later and he’s at the dentist. He appreciated my text. I choose to set up time next Tuesday. He agrees. Hope is still alive.\nPay my workers for their hard work. Realize I’m still losing money. That’s expected. im investing.\nwrite down all the tools I’ve subscribed to in the last three weeks.\nSend credentials to my team so they can use these tools.\nGet four audits from my SEO expert. Tell him what to improve. He sends back more content.\nmove content to Google drive.\nSet up client folders on Google drive. Set up documents with info per client to collaborate. Have assistant help.\nspend 3 hours preparing for key partner. I spent 10 the prior week. I’m excited. Call goes well.\nSend material to other potential key partner. He’s excited. I’m excited. May be a few weeks or months before it’s a good time though. Keep building. Remember to follow up.\nReach out to another key partner.\nA friend from high school I haven’t seen since 2008 wants to chat. He does what I do but for sales (I’m on marketing). Have a chat. He tells me he wants to send me clients. I tell him I need his help. He sets up more time on Monday to chat. Hope builds.\ncollege friend who does a different type of SEO than me reaches out. His cousin needs help with Local SEO (my specialty). I send phone number.\nSaid cousin calls me within an hour. I don’t recognize the number but I pick up now. Person is from my grandma’s home town. Wild. Another small connection. Person asks me about Google business profile. I answer. They seem relieved. They ask for my services. I send a doc. Set up time to chat Tuesday.\nDecline meeting with one person because I’m so busy.\nGo to work because I’m not full time. Manage work….\nSet up asana instead of ClickUp for task management. Asana is expensive. ClickUp is free. But ClickUp is complicated. I realize $100/mo is not worth complication.\nAdd 6 people to asana. Track down their emails. Realize I forgot each persons hourly rate. Create an HR spreadsheet.\nAdd 4 people to slack. I need to get off email for internal work. Happy.\nJust realized I forgot to add that friends cousin to my CRM. Pause now to add them. They’re added 3 minutes later. Had to look up their email to add to my CRM.\nRealized my CRM isn’t connected to my email. Sync is broken. Reach out to customer support.\nRealize after switching Gmail to Outlook that calendly and outlook are stuck to the Microsoft version of my email address. That’s weird. Fix outlook in my mobile. Fix calendly. Can now book appointments properly. Success.\nHad a customer call. Chat for 30 min about next steps. Phone dies mid call. Back to real job.\nrealize I paid my part timer for not doing anything this week. Crap. I quickly send them their task, which was stuck in draft mode on slack. I make a note to my assistant to ensure this doesn’t slip through.\nGet access to Google business profiles. Send them to my developer.\nMigrate subscriptions off of an old Gmail. I’m official now. I should have everything on my @silvermineai.com domain\nAdd all subscriptions to my finance tracker.\nRandom people I haven’t spoken to in years or ever start commenting on my fb posts. I reach out to one. They have a non-profit. I suddenly want to help. I now can because I do websites. They need help with their website. I get excited about their mission.\nHopped on Facebook to post this. Realize there’s an ad about Facebook marketing. I click. The content is exactly what I’m looking for. I could probably find it online on YouTube but I buy a 2.5 hour course. Paid content is usually better than free. Not always. I say no to all upselling stuff. Inbox gets links to the course.\nChat with guy about working together on something else. Realize I didn’t text him back. Just opened my notes and sent him the thing I 95% finished.\nAfter sending this blurb I realized I have a buddy I’ve been meaning to reach out to. I do a quick audit of his Google ranking for his stores. I send off some analytics.\nThree nights this week I only got 6 hours of sleep. Body fatigue.\n\nWhy am I doing this?\n\nSupport my family. I’ve got 6 mouths to feed. California is a tough break for anyone trying to live here. Taxes are high. Most people are dual income. This raises housing prices.\nEmpower others. I find intense emotional fulfillment in helping others grow.\nGrow. I’m up for new challenges. This is right up my alley.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "Since June 7th",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What have I learned since June 7th, the day I announced my marketing agency on Facebook?\n\nThere are so many entrepreneurs in my network. People building and growing. People with dreams of creating value in their own unique way. I think I’ve spoken to 15 people off that one post alone.\nThere are people who want to work with you. You just have to let them know you’re open for business.\nCreating value is about doing things that others don’t have time for, but know is important. We all have 100 things going on in our overly busy lives. It’s a relief to outsource those problems where we can.\nSo many ideas stall because people just forget of them. People tell me “I’ve wanted to do this for years but other priorities have taken place”. Hiring someone can help provide a catalyst of new ideas and opportunities.\nSome people are reasonably skeptical. So many scammers out there in the marketing world. I hope to make a difference. I see the opportunity for good marketing.\nI’ve transitioned mentally from being an individual contributor to an operator. I’ve got four team members who just hammer away at tasks I send them. It’s stressful, but exciting!\nAnyone using AI tools can do remarkable things. High schoolers on AI can do as much as a 5 year experienced individual. My team is remote and the tools they use make their work shine as good as I could have done it.\nAI is enabling people with good ideas to provide exceptional value. I’m a software engineer by trade and being able to work with marketing AI tools is really exciting.\nI’m exhausted. In the best way possible. I couldn’t do it without Veronica Rosdahl Whiting’s support.\nit’s fairly easy to give a really hardworking individual a life changing amount of money for doing solid work. I paid this guy $40 for helping me organize a bunch of stuff. He said it was life changing. Super humbling to learn of the great fortunes we have in the US. I could then hire him full time as my executive assistant and he’s helping us serve our 6 new customers since June 7th.\n\n\n\nmarketing is about following up. About showing up. Reach out to everyone who likes your post. Ask them if they know anyone. Ask them if there’s some way you can help them.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

At any moment it could all just go poof.\n\nThere is no in between. It’s just a game of tennis. This is anxiety. I hope it doesn’t always have to be like this.\nWhen I take a step back and look at the bigger picture though, this is what my last month has looked like (See below). It’s good to sit back and look.\nI believe this is going to work out. I do. It will because it’s not some massive risk. It’s very small but sized opportunities. Each client is their own. There is no coordinated systemic risk. I’m not swinging for the fences. I just need a few bunts per month. If bunt 1 misses, it’s uncorrelated with bunt 2. They’ll fall. People see the value.

Great work @Guil!\n@Sean joined us. he’s working on doing some cold calls and helping with some Local SEO audits. Welcome Sean!\nNo new deasl this week, Had several people say they’ll pay next week. one cold call from @Guil , and two of my friends. Once this happens, we’re no longer losing money! (good for you - means you get more employment for years to come!) A lot of people are busy july 3-5 because of the holiday.\nBuilt out a website http://www.precisionconcretebayarea.com from @Joshua Dumalag. Congrats Josh! A few more finishing touches and the customer will be really happy!\nMade a pitch to a big apartment company. Hoping they close in the coming weeks.\n@Lou Elton Evasco started working with our customer CGRE to help with ads.\n@VeNae Rosdahl built our customer’s ads in Canva.\nWe launched http://docs.silvermineai.com/services and other websites to share out to customers.\nWe did a ton of behind-the-scenes work like onboarding flow @Mark Jayson Realino. just check asana for all the tasks Mark has put out!\nSpoke with a dental group (2 locations) that wants us. The marketer is sold (wife of the husband dentist), she just needs to check with her team. This could be a ~2k/mo deal!\n\nHousekeeping: - I paid most people as of the time of this post. if you haven’t been paid, check your DM’s.\nNext week: - Goal: sign 2 deals out of 3-4 that are hopeful. None are more than 2 weeks old since Guil’s first cold call, it typically takes 3-4 fweeks to close. @Guil’s confident that within time a lot of these folks will\nTeam notes: - Thank you for all the work that you’re doing. As of June 7, none of you existed to me. Now we have 7 paid staff, 6 paying customers ($1515/mo MRR - all friends and family). This was an incredibly wild month. I honestly didn’t think this was really possible, but here we are. - I think we have our team - we’re ready to scale to Ads and Social media, and we have plenty of support on Local SEO work. We’ll focus on growing our business for the next month. - I’m invested in helping each of you grow in your careers. Where there’s hard work, I recognize it! I’ve already given 2 raises. I see what you put in! I want to support you and your families for years to come. - We’re all learning together. Thanks for your patience. I apologize if I’m not immediately responsive to every question. - When in doubt, take some actions and just let me know what you did!

    "text": "I’m thinking about Three cold calls and what I learned.\nOne guy hears my pitch and in 5 minutes he’s nodding his head. Then he asks, “Why do you charge $650 but people in India tell me they can do it for $225?” He says he gets these calls all the time.\nAnother guy says, “I paid $250/year for my website. There’s no way I can justify your costs. I’m a simple guy and I don’t need anything fancy.” This second guy raked me over the coals an I know I shouldn’t give in but I took it as a learning experience to see what might happen.\nHe gets me to basically offer my services at cost, but I tell him I can only keep the deal open tonight. He responds:\n\nThat may work for me, but I always avoid making decisions under pressure, such a false urgency. Give me a few days to think about it. What do you have to lose?\n\n\nI thought a lot about this. It’s an interesting question. I know from $100M Leads, This is Marketing, and Emotional Intelligence for Sales Success that when you concede, you regret it. And it’s a race to the bottom on price.\nAt his rates, someone would need to maintain 500 websites per year to support a family. That’s an insane amount of overhead. He should just use squarespace for $20/mo. I told him this.\nThe first guy hears my pitch and says, “see what I like about this is you’re here in San Jose. I could come see you if I want. I don’t want some random company in India that doesn’t care about me.”\nThe thought of “I could never justify this” is fascinating. It tells me this person is transaction focused. It’s quite easy to “justify” when you consider operating your business quickly. I could get him the site today. Instead he’s taking people over the coals until he works with someone desperate enough to take his offer. The justification is: does this service get me more leads?\nBut he didn’t see it that way. He only saw, “I can get this cheaper elsewhere.”\nThose two mentalities are two I’ve struggled with. Most of my life I’ve focused on getting things done more cheaply and feeling like I’m being robbed. Or, focusing on solving the problem.\nPer Thinking, Fast and Slow we have two sides of our brain. If we lose $100 bill on the way to buy $100 worth of tickets we’re likely to buy the tickets with a new $100. If we lose two pre-purchased tickets on the way to the show, we’re likely to walk away rather than spend $100 to buy two new tickets. The cost is the same, but the mental and emotional accounting is different. This is sunk cost.\nPerson 1 is relationship and growth focused. They want the problem gone so they can focus on other things. They also say “yea I could get this cheaper somewhere but there are several costs like time, energy, and dealing with India I don’t wanna deal with.” He says “if it gets me two customers a month it’s worth it.” He’s value focused. He doesn’t think: “can I get this cheaper somewhere else?”\nSecond guy is not value focused but transaction and price focused. Maybe he does this with everyone he meets. It’ll slow him down. As a home builder he could get $10000 clients from a well built website. That’s not worth $100/mo for him so he’s going to get a crappy site with no traffic (I’ve built many crappy sites that don’t get traffic. Good sites require work!)\nDo business with value-based customers. They grow faster. They’re deal oriented. Relationship oriented.\nDon’t do business with transaction/cost-oriented customers. They’ll take you up front and throughout your journey, costing far more in time and energy, which allows your momentum and hurts your growth.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Instead of asking doubtfully, he asks faithfully.\nIt reminds me of Enoch:\n\n31 And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord, saying: Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant? 32 And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Moses 6.31–32\n\nThe Lord didn’t tell him why he was chosen. He just said “go forth”.\nThe Lord’s thoughts are above our thoughts. Too often we put limiting beliefs on ourselves - I’m not good enough, why me? Or, why would God want to help me?\nWhy not instead ask, “why wouldn’t Heavenly Father want to help me? He loves me and has promised he would help me.”\n\n\n\nAngels want to help\n\n\nI love this quote by Jared after just going through something really hard:\n\nAnd it came to pass that Jared spake again unto his brother, saying: Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is choice above all the earth? And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our inheritance. Ether 1.38\n\nJust lost your job? Who knoweth but the Lord will provide a better one? Just lost your house? Who knoweth but the Lord will give you a promised land? (They had lost their jobs and house and were wandering at this point.)

It’ll be the means of converting people to Him and His gospel:\n\nTherefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid. 2 Nephi 27.26\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

In 2 Nephi 25.26 it’s mentioned “that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.”\nThey had the scriptures because they accomplished the task laid before them, “I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” 1 Nephi 3.7\nThese scriptures were “desirable”.

    "text": "The story of the Savior’s birth brings many wonderful concepts to memory and can teach us a lot about what will bring us true joy and happiness in this life.\n\n\n\nThe Christ Child\n\n\nThis is my favorite video of the Christmas story. The most powerful part is the moment when Mary sings a lullaby to Jesus. I remember reading somewhere that this moment was completely impromptu by the actress, and it speaks volumes to the sacredness of the moment where Mary first laid eyes on her beloved son.\n\nSo what does this story give me perspective on at this time of year?\n\nChrist was the rightful, bloodline heir to King David’s throne. He was the King of the Jews. But he never sought authority. He never sought a throne. He instead taught “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s”. He didn’t engage in turf battles. In rebellion. In insurrection. He just wanted people to find happiness in their circumstances by living with lovingkindness in their hearts for their God, their neighbor, and themselves.\nIn his role as a Savior and Judge of the world, he sought to not condemn the sinner trapped in the act of sin. Instead he came to liberate. To forgive. To support.\nIf you believe Christ was the Creator and Savior of the world, consider how He chose to come into the world. He was born in a stable, mucked with animal feces and rotting food scraps, covered with the stench of…a stable. He was rejected of a room in the inn. He was laid in a manger, perhaps a feeding trough. Maybe Mary had help giving birth, maybe she didn’t. He was born generally alone. I wonder if He chose to do his birth this way because nobody can say he had it easy. He didn’t have the special treatment of a King’s birth. No, he was born to an exhausted, weary traveler, likely on the cold hard floor of a dirty barn.\nIf we think about the Savior being the architect of this birth, think about how he planned for angels to show up to shepherds. Not King Herod. The shepherds. He would be the prophesied sacrificial Lamb. He would be the Good Shepherd. Yet these people were perhaps the minimum wage, forgotten ones outside the city gate. Yet these are those who had the privilege to see Him first. And He invited them to come and see. His whole life was an invitation.\nHe also invited the rich wise men. All are invited. He wanted all to see, and he wanted the world to know that He was for everyone regardless their circumstances. And that all of us, whether destitute or traveling with caravans, can bring the gifts of our heart to Him. We don’t need to bring gold. He just wants a “broken heart and contrite spirit.\n\nHow can we apply these things to our life, today?\n\nSeek out the forgotten. The people in our life that seem forgotten. The servants in our life (person on the other end of the customer support line, the checkout person, your supervisor) but even, your best friend who seems to be doing great…\nSeek not riches or wealth. Harod sought these things. Christ sought relationships and truth.\nDon’t seek for power. Christ deserved it. Christ had it. He turned water to wine, cursed a tree, and made a host of men fall over at the sound of his voice. Yet he didn’t touch the Romans.\nSeek to invite. To share. To uplift. Christ made shepherds feel important. He invited them to his crib side. And ” his hand is stretched out still.” (Isaiah 9:12)\n\nHe came like all of us, as a child. But he came to show us how a God would live. And he did.\n\n\n\nThe Christ as a Child, before worshipping Wise men\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Keeping the commandments means being honest, being kind, being respectful, finding a way to help others. Not being lazy. Being productive.\nLiterally, nobody can prosper without keeping some commandment. Without finding a way to meet someone’s need.\nI also like this verse:\n\nAwake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust. 2 Nephi 1.23\n\nIt’s a rallying cry we can all relate to. We are all bound with chains in life.

He says that years before arriving in the promised land.\nBut now, years later, he testifies:\n\nnotwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. 2 Nephi 1.5\n\nHow long did it take for them to receive that land? Many years. And many hardships. Lehi complained and was chastised at some point (1 Nephi 16). So the journey isn’t without its struggles.\n\n\n\nLand of promise\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nThe Lord is with us. Even if we complain and struggle, He wants to help us get to a better place, our promised lands.\nWe can be like Lehi and seek to obtain that personal vision.

    "text": "A friend gave a talk in church about missionary work, which is the Lord’s invitation to share His gospel and good news with the world. Having been a missionary for two years, it’s much less about “effective sales” strategies and much more about trying to live like a good person and invite others to enjoy the benefits of following Christ.\nI bring up the point about sales because a lot of people outside of the church can see LDS missionaries as salespeople. To one degree, they are: they’re trying to change people’s belief system. Adopt Christianity. 1\nYea, that’s certainly a reasonable way to look at it from one angle. But the reality is more like “I have something that’s great and I want other people to benefit from it the same way I benefit from it”. Or better said: there’s so much…misinformation about my church and Christianity in general, how do I have a productive conversation with you about it without knowing where you are? I’d love to talk to you about it, but are you deeply inwardly vehemently against it for some obtuse reason I’m not aware of? That’s what provoked some fear in sharing His good news.\nBut these fears aren’t warranted. Because that isn’t the right focus from my end. The best focus for “missionary work” is: if I have something that’s great in my life, I should share it like anything else great in my life.\nDid I see a good movie over the weekend? Great, share it. Did i hear a great talk on Sunday at church? Great, share it. Did I have a good hike? Awesome, share it. Did I have a funny experience while teaching some kids on Sunday? Yea, dope. Share it.\nThings I liked from my friends talk:\nThis cold plunge analogy is interesting: because it’s always hard. Always intimidating. I think that’s true in my personal experience. But for me it’s more like… the opposite of hyperextending my knee.\nWhen I was in high school I got a knee injury. I hyperextended it. The first time was incredibly painful. I was out a few days. But then I came back and was fine-ish. Then a few weeks later I did it again. Then a few days later: again. By the end of the season, I was hyperextending it every other day. It was bad news. A few weeks after the season ended I was playing in a bball tournament and again big hyperextending.\nI stopped playing sports that summer and let myself heal up. Haven’t had problems since.\nSame with sharing the gospel, but the opposite. At first it’s really intimidating. You do it once and you realize it’s not that bad. Then the more you do it the more it becomes part of your day.\nKinda like writing in this blog. At first I’m trying to find my voice. Now I don’t care and just want to write. I hope it’s beneficial for you.\nThis reminded me of President Russel M. Nelson’s invitation:\nIf your note a member of the church you may balk at “baptism skyrocketing”. It kinda gives a cultish vibe if that’s how you see it - our goal is to baptize everyone!! I get it. Not great language from the outsider’s perspective if that’s how you see it.\nHaving been a member of the church my whole life, I’ve heard this rhetoric a lot - get baptisms. But I think this is more of a sociological misrepresentation of a deeply inward desire to share what’s good in your life with others.\nDo I want to baptize the world? Umm…do I want everyone to have world peace? Yea.\nWill baptizing someone give them peace? No. Well, not just dunking yourself in a hot-tub sized mini pool.\nWill someone who has a sincere desire to follow Christ the rest of their life benefit from being baptized because it gives them a chance to publicly commit to following Christ and thus be supported by a community of like-minded people also trying to self-improve constantly? Yea. Baptism would be great here.\nDo I want to baptize everyone? No. I would love it if everyone desired to follow Jesus a little more in their life. Learn a little more about him. So, yea I want everyone to be baptized.\nThis is the spirit which my friend is describing.\nSo doubling baptisms is this notion of a very fascinating cultural experience: we have as a church more success in helping other people discover the joy of following Christ by how we package “the message”. Yea, it’s sales at some level. What’s a better strategy? Cold calling or referrals? Always referrals. There’s trust there. The product doesn’t seem as strange. Likewise, it takes a lot to change a set of religious beliefs. Having seen someone you know and enjoy associating with benefit from the religion helps make it more palatable at first to begin discussions.\nLastly, this strategy is fascinating: focus on teaching people who already believe in God about why they believe in God, or more about His story. These refreshers help enliven the mind, no different than perhaps me going back to some Stat 121 material and just really appreciating its elegance (even though I do more advanced math in my day to day). Teach people the basics and they’ll remember what they love about it.\nEnd/rant.\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Sometimes he reminds us of the things he’s already given us (white). He reminds us of words from the scriptures. He reminds us of past prayers. He reminds us to pray.\nAnd if we look more closely, we actually do see a similarity between Brother of Jared and Lehi because they “built barges after the manner which they had built, according to the instructions of the Lord.” (Ether 2.16)\nMeaning: they already had the answer and the Lord just had to remind them.\nMeaning: their liahona was the fact that they already had directions from the Lord.\nLet’s go back a little. Earlier in Jaredite journey, they were being very deliberately lead by the Lord:\n\nAnd it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions whither they should travel. Ether 2.5\n\nNot only that, but the Lord gave them instructions on how to build a barge:\n\nAnd it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and did build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord. Ether 2.6\n\nSo Lehi and Brother of Jared were both pointed in the direction they should go. But the Lord teaches them each in their own way. For Lehi he gives him a Liahona and tells him to read the words therein. This is a physical tool, kind of like the Book of Mormon and other scripture. We should not be surprised if sometimes the Lord tells us “go to the scriptures, I will answer your question there” or “listen to general conference”. The Lord often points us to places where He’ll speak to us, giving us opportunities to show our faith and do our part.\nOn the other hand, sometimes he may guide us by the hand and show us the way to go. He may directly just tell us to go one way. This is another way of His for interacting with us.\nAnd interestingly, he later told brother of Jared “remember those barges I gave you four years ago? Rebuild more.” He didn’t necessarily give them more designs but reminded the Jaredites of how he had already guided them.\n\n\n\nBrother of Jared and the Lord\n\n\nThere is power in remembering the things the Lord has already done for us. We shouldn’t always seek new signs. We should seek to remember. And in remembering, we’re lead anew.\n\nWhat I Learned\n\nThe Lord guides the same person in different ways\nHe guides two people in the same circumstance in different ways\nHe asks us to remember\nIf we’ve embarked on the journey, even if we stumble, he’ll lovingly chastise us to remember the Way\n\n\n\nMeaning\nI take solice in that He wants to guide me personally. He may ask me to read my scriptures. He may remind me of a past time. He may give me specific instructions. He may just expect me to walk or build and do the thing I’m supposed to do. Keep going until you receive further instruction.\nHe’s also actually heavily involved in the details it seems. We may wander lost (Israelites) or be caught relaxing for four years on the beach (Jaredites), but He’s still very heavily involved. I can trust He loves me and wants to guide me.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

It’s not like that. This is a book that inspires personal revelation and a relationship with Christ and Heavenly Father. I get the most out of it when I have a true desire in my heart:\n\nAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. Moroni 10.4\n\nWhen I read it in a rush, I don’t get much out of it. When I don’t pray before hand, or if I’m not sincere, I don’t really get anything substantive.\nIt’s like texting vs calling a friend. If you’re in a rush, you give a half thought text. But if you’re on a long drive and want to build a relationship, you give the friend a call.\n\n\n\nIf you plant a seed, you need to nourish it\n\n\nThe best insight doesn’t come from the Book of Mormon. It comes from the Holy Ghost. So I can read the book as a literary critique and not see its divinity. But as I read it trying to build a relationship with Heavenly Father, then I feel that relationship grow.\n\nNow, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.

    "text": "Today is fast Sunday, a day when testimonies are shared in church. Here’s my testimony I shared today. Someone had just spoken about moving to a new place and seeing God in their lives, even if it was far away from where they had thought they needed to be. They had moved away from family.\nI was reminded today of why I live where I do. Without going into personal details, as a family we decided it was time to leave the east coast and move west. As I wondered how it might be possible, I was encouraged by my wife to reach out to an old contact on a random spreadsheet I had kept seven years prior when I was first looking for jobs. The guy had since changed jobs from when he had interviewed me, but he referred me to his new company.\nWell, this company was otherwise impossible to get noticed at, even with referrals. Turns out this guy was a lot higher than I had known. It was enough to get me the first interview. Four years later we’re still on the west coast. It’s definitely a better situation for our family in many ways.\n\n\n\nMoving because when we had a desire, the Lord opened the door for us\n\n\nAnd in terms of family, I grew up living far away from cousins. My church congregation became my family. My parents friends became my Sunday school teachers and mentors. My friends at church became my closest confidants and kept me company in living the principles I believed in.\nRecently, this church family helped us with meals, gifts, and emotional warmth. I don’t know what I’d do without belonging to a group of people who care for one another (I know many communities are like this, but I think it’s extra special in a Christian context where everyone wants to help and strengthen each other in kindness. We all try their best.)\nChrist’s design that we have a church is inspired:\n\nThere is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. Ephesians 4.4–6\n\nAnd are we not all family? The spiritual children of Christ and sons and daughters of Heavenly Father.\n\nAnd now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters. … therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ… Mosiah 5.7–8\n\nI testify the Hand of God is real. He leads and guides people to where they need to be gathered. And when we gather together as one body, miracles happen.\n\nI also love this scripture, how Lehi was guided to a “land of promise”.\n\nbehold, I have obtained a land of promise 1 Nephi 5.5\n\nHe wrote “have obtained” while he was struggling for food and water in the desert. He saw ahead to when he’d eventually live in a near rain forest paradise.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A great quote leading up to MLK Jr day:\n\nBehold I have dreamed a dream 1 Nephi 3.2\n\nLehi dreamed many dreams. It got him in trouble with his boys, as Laman and Lemuel “did murmur in many things against their father, because he was a visionary man” (1 Nephi 2.11).\nLehi’s wife, Sariah, also murmured against him, “she also had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.” (1 Nephi 5.2)\nLehi’s response to this is great:\n\nI know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren. But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness. 1 Nephi 5.4–5\n\nThis response teaches me a few things:\n\nwhen people struggle, they can complain against a good thing and make it a bad thing. “Why do you always have to be such a goodie two shoes?”\nThe response is “if I weren’t such a goodie two shoes I’d be miserable”. Helps remind people of the value of their own biases.\n\nComplaining is a natural part of life. Just be careful what you complain about.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "The modern refrain is to do and be whatever you want. While I largely agree with this refrain, there are some caveats: certain things bring us happiness. Being kind to people. Helping people. Saying sorry, etc.\n\nAnd the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost. 1 Nephi 12.17\n\n\n\n\nAll the roads we can take can confuse us. Instead, we can focus on where we’re heading\n\n\nThe temptation we all face is to be lured down broad roads. By contrast, the way of the Lord is the straight and narrow.\nOnce I was working with someone and I was writing my code a few ways, with a bunch of tries that had failed. I finally kept the right one along side the failures. The reviewer said “why do you keep this junk?” I thought; because it helps me remember the way to not do it. “Why not just keep the answer though?”\nSometimes we like to focus on the “broad” roads in a few ways.\n\nRemember all our failings, rather than focus on the things that bring us happiness. We do this as a badge of “I don’t want to repeat those bad mistakes.” Sure, the intent is good, but that’s like carrying a broken phone around with you to remind you not to drop your phone again. The effect is far more positive if we focus on the good things that come from following Christ.\nThere are a lot of paths we can go down in life. The Lord wants us to do many good things! (Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols). But there are a few roads he doesn’t want us to go down: selfishness, greed, love of money, etc. These roads are broad. There are a lot of ways to lose yourself.\n\nSo remember, “focus on the right answer”. Focus on the Savior, and walk towards him. Drop your load at his feet (Matthew 11.28–30).\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

But you really can’t prevent bad things from happening by creating a law because laws are just rules. They define what’s bad.\nConsider the law of Moses. It defined what was bad. The Ten Commandments. The ordinances. The many rituals and performances.\nBut the law was dead.\n\nAnd, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled. 2 Nephi 25.24\n\n\nFor, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments. 26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. 2 Nephi 25.25–26\n\nForgetting even the spirit of the law, we can just focus on Christ. Just men need no law. # Meaning\nThe goal of following Christ isn’t to follow him. It’s to become like him. To experience what He experienced. To feel what He felt.

    "text": "The responsibility of a Father is to preside:\n\nBy divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. The Family Proclamation\n\nI’ve long wondered what this meant. Earlier in my marriage I wondered: does this mean a father leads all family gatherings, has the first or last word, or delegates who says the prayer? That’s probably because the word “preside” is used synonymously with lead with respect to church callings and such:\n\nVerily, I say unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts, there must needs be presiding elders to preside over those who are of the office of an elder; And also priests to preside over those who are of the office of a priest; 62 And also teachers to preside over those who are of the office of a teacher, in like manner, and also the deacons Doctrine and Covenants 107.60–62\n\nI never really wondered if this was “who calls the shots”, or “who runs the show” - that never felt like a thing because my father is a gentle, servant leader. But I know some wonder what the details of this phrase mean. And what does it mean for single moms?\nWell, I recently learned what I think it means. I started getting slightly more-than-average stressed with being sleep deprived after having a newborn.\nI noticed, by consequence, my kids appeared more agitated. I remembered my Mood is Contagious.\nOnce I got more sleep, I realized the kids model my behavior as a father than follow my words. The way I talk to them is how they talk to each other - for better or worse.\nEvery parent knows this.\nSo while “preside” technically means to lead a meeting, it also means to lead a gathering. Is a family not a gathering?\n\n…how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you. And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, 3 Nephi 10.4–5\n\n\n\n\nShouldn’t we preside more like this?\n\n\nMaybe we can preside more like Christ: with kindness, gentleness, and love unfeigned.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

And maybe we hide behind these insecurities by laughing at those who have more.\nMaybe we hide behind our insecurity and question God. The Wise One.\nSee, Christ is our Brick. He’s the safety. He’s the home we can run to when the world blows us over. He’s the Prepared One who was wishing for us to come to him the whole time. The cry of “you’ll be sorry” by this brother could perhaps be His loving warning of “please be wise. There’s a wolf out there.” Yet we don’t listen. We want to play.\nI love the third pig because he lets them in.\nAlso, the third pig never had to worry about almost getting eaten. Sure, first two enjoyed their fiddle and dance. But they almost died. The third pig is like the non-prodigal son. The one who stayed home and enjoyed the safety of the home the whole time.\nBe wise. Be forgiving. And yes, we always have a wise elder Brother who will accept us."

When we give, people feel a social debt and want to repay it even more than what was given.\nBoth of these things are taught by the Savior’s desire for us to give freely, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” (Acts 20.35)\nConsider the design: instill in people a desire to repay debts. When one person gives, other people give more back. Then the first person wants to give because a surplus was given to them. And then and then and then.

    "text": "Do you believe in what Nephi came to know?\n\nYea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. 2 Nephi 4.35\n\nWhat are the limitations we can put on the Lord? Here are a few that get me:\n\nThe Lord wants me to struggle on this one\nI don’t want to ask too much\nThis isn’t that big of a deal. I should pray about more important things instead.\n\nAll three of these are easily contradicted by scriptures. He does want us to struggle but struggle with him and overcome (1 Corinthians 10.13). The Lord wants us to ask for all the blessings He’s capable of giving us (Malachi 3.10), and pour out endless blessings.1 And lastly, the Lord works by small and simple means (Alma 37.7).\nPerhaps instead those three things should be exactly what we pray for:\n\nWhat can we struggle on together? (Matthew 11.28–30)\nWhat’s the gift that thou art willing to bless me with? (Matthew 6.8 )\nWhat’s the smallest piece of help I could possibly ask for? (Ether 2.23)\n\nThe phrase “ask not amiss” isn’t some indication that a secret code needs to be enacted. That to unlock the heavens, the prayer needs to be offered in the right way at the right time by the right person.\nHow can you ask amiss? The scriptures teach us. If we’re selfish, seek our own, are puffed up, are easily provoked, want revenge, are greedy, etc. then we’re asking amiss.\nBut if we’re trying to do our best to be good people and dealing with the challenging responsibilities of being a father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, neighbor, coworker, manager, etc. then we’re just dealing with life.\nWhat is life without these titles? Who doesn’t work? Who doesn’t have someone to care for?\nIt’s precisely these things that are worthy of our prayers and divine supplication.\n\n\n\nPray\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Nephi saw a vision because he desired knowledge. Consider the Angel’s instruction:\n\n7 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God. 1 Nephi 11.7\n\nNow, we know that the Lord rebuked the Pharisees for seeking signs:\n\nThe Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. Matthew 16.1–4\n\nBut signs themselves are good. Moses lead by signs: the seven miracles. Baal was trumped by a sign: fire from heaven. Manna in the wilderness. Water from the rock. The fall of the city from trumpets. Oil in the vial.\nAny miracle is a sign. A sign that God exists. That He has all power. That Christ is His son.\nBut today we don’t need to seek for new signs but instead do as the Lord said and “discern the signs of the times”.\nBy seeking to see His hand, we find the signs.\nIt’s wicked to seek for a sign, because wicked means “unrepentant”. An unrepentant soul, one who is not going to Heavenly Father and seeking His love, doesn’t see the Hand of God in their life. As a result, they are without his signs (Gratus sum, ergo habeo).\nSo to see signs:\n\nRepent (desire a connection with Heavenly Father and His son)\nLook for them (discern)\n\nPresto poof.\n\n\n\nWhy would I believe a new sign if I don’t believe the old signs?\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Scriptures\nThere is so much doctrine packed in here. Nephi is talking about the Lord doing a “marvelous work”\n\nAnd it [the marvelous work] shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel. Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel. 1 Nephi 22.9–12\n\nThe Lord will restore His covenants. It doesn’t explicitly say “baptism, the sacrament, the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the endowment, and the sealing ordinance”, but that’s what Nephi is referring to.\n\n\n\nThe Lord will gather us into His silo. This is His work, not ours.\n\n\nWhy doesn’t the Book of Mormon mention the sealing ordinance? The Melchizedek priesthood (the name of it)? The endowment? I’m not sure. But it’s fascinating how Joseph Smith translated this book but also received revelations to help finalize the structure of the church. # Meaning\nThis teaches me that…\n\nThe Lord cares about people who reject him. He will do His work among them. He won’t leave me even if I leave Him. That’s a powerful concept.\nThe covenants are the most important thing to focus on in the scriptures. Everything else is just context about how to best live them.\nI am gathered when I keep my covenants. They are the thing that help me understand and connect with the Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Helaman 5.12\n\n\n\nMeaning\nIn reading Thinking, Fast and Slow, a big section is dedicated to the tale of two selves: the experiencing self and the remembering self.\nThe peak-end bias is that despite enjoying several hours or years of an experience, we only remember the high and the end. This happens in movies - if you don’t like how it ends you hate the movie. If you don’t like the bill you won’t remember the food you just ate.\nI was sick this week, laying on the ground unable to move much with some food poisoning. I said a prayer to have a positive experience, or to learn something. And I did! While sick I was just impressed at how my body was able to instinctively know what to do to fight the illness.\nAnd now I look back and I’m almost glad I had that experience. It taught me some important things.\nThat’s the power I’ve felt of building a foundation on Christ. When I’m challenged, I know I can seek the Lord (it’s easier to remember this with a physical sickness than many other things in life). And when I do, He both helps the experiencing self and the remembering self. He consecrates those experiences for our good 2-nephi-32.9 .\n\nhe will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.\n\nHe will consecrate both hard and good things for our good.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Jacob 1.8\n\nChrist was clearly angry when he flipped the market at the temple. And it’s said he’s a “jealous” God and has his wrath and such.\nGod won’t be mocked. But he’s the first to love and forgive us. So when we bring upon us his wrath, I see this as we’re bringing upon ourselves the consequences of our own actions. The wrath was determined when He made the law. But it’s better said “we bring upon ourselves the wrath of breaking his commandments” than “provoke him to anger”, for Charity sufferers long and is Kind and is not easily provoked.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I want to share my experience with how prayer has turned from not very meaningful to substantively helpful in a matter of a few short weeks.\nConsider the scene:\nAny parent comes across this more than once per day.\nMost of last year I felt like I wasn’t getting a whole lot out of my prayers. A few comments:\nOkay. So that’s last year. Lots of prayers. I know God loves me regardless of how effective they are. And I know they could be better.\nBack to the scene. There were several times last year when the kids were nuts and I needed to calm myself down. It was hard. I tried a few times to go and pray but just felt like “it’s not working!” Im praying! Why can’t I get to a better state of mind?! This prayer thing isn’t working for me and I’m doing it wrong.\nI never felt like prayer wasn’t good or useful. Just that I couldn’t get it to do what I wanted it to do for me: fix me. I figured: maybe I need to pray differently. Or try XYZ thing.\nOkay, so throw up a prayer and hope it sticks. Change me! I’m here.\nNope. Didn’t work. I’d still be struggling with patience in those circumstances.\nLast night I had a new experience. I did pray the same way I’ve prayed before when stressed. No, I didn’t get fixed - God doesn’t fix us like that. Instead, while praying I remembered a mindset Find the Fun that I had discovered last week. That’s all that came to mind. I left the prayer still agitated because a kid was about to jump on another kid while I was praying and I had to leave the prayer.\nWhat happened though? I was just like 20% less stressed as I tried focusing on Find the Fun.\nOkay, so the night went better than it did last week. I had something in my mind to hold on to.\nWhat’s the difference between the me yesterday and the me of three weeks ago? I changed my relationship with prayer.\nI’ve been trying to have just one good prayer per day. It’s a goal for this year. And a good prayer is one where I try to get some type of insight. Like meditation. Just pray until an insight. Setting a timer helps me. Doing it in my office or a place where I’m alone helps too. And when I’m done, I write down the insight.\nMost of the time the insight isn’t like from God or anything. I don’t hear a voice. I don’t have any mental image. The insight for me usually comes from me hearing myself pray. “Oh, I didn’t realize that was on my mind” or “oh, how did I think of that?” I’ve come to learn that this is a spiritual prayer. This is praying by the spirit. When I desire to connect with God (get something out of my prayer), I’m elevated ever so slightly (I’m grateful for small things).\nAnd that’s it: I’ve been doing this for about two or weeks now and my relationship with prayer is changing. I no longer want it to fix me. I see it as a way to try to connect with heaven in a small way.\nAnd that’s the realization: the power of prayer isn’t in the hail Mary’s. It’s in the consistent relationship with it.\nI do believe a Hail Mary is better than no Hail. So hail away.\nThe Lord hears your cries even if you’re wicked. Pray regardless. But there is a concept of Him being slow to hear at times: feeling the effect of prayer requires consistency. But he’s happy to help any time we come to Him. He’s not vindictive. He’s not “I told you so” or “you should be coming to me more often than this”. That’s how we treat each other, with pride. God isn’t like that. Heavenly Father wants us to come to him, and he’ll hear our cries.\nTranslating this to me: i wasn’t wicked or anything. I was just a stressed out dad. But I think the principle applies: if I have a lackluster relationship with prayer then he’ll be slow to hear. Or, said another way, I’ll be slow to hear. Slow to see. More reactive. More knee jerky and less patient. More thinking “why doesn’t this prayer thing work for me?”\nSo that’s my insight. Make prayer meaningful and it starts to pay dividends slowly. Very slowly. But I also believe in compounding interest.\nif your investments gain 0.1% each day of the year, do you know what your returns would be over a year? 44% increase. So if you invest $100 today, by the end of the year you’ll have $144 if you keep reinvesting your returns. Thats insanely good! But that’s math. that’s compounding interest.2\nSo shoot for a 0.1% prayer. That’s all it’s gotta be to get massive returns.\nSo that’s the invitation: try to make prayer meaningful (whatever that means to you, not me). And try to do it consistently.\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

The fallacy a mind believes is “if only they’re better I’d be at more peace”. Consider the alternative: if they were peaceful but I’m still in a mindset of control. Would I be happier? Perhaps I would feel more comfortable (less noise in my ear). But I’m going to posit that a person in a mindset of control, regardless of whether they’re being listened to and their control is being obeyed, aren’t happy and aren’t mindful. They aren’t present with what is. A healthier mindset for me might be: “anything could happen, delightful that they’re food now, but it’s okay if they misbehave. They’re kids! How can I Find the Fun in this moment?”↩︎\nThe math is this: 1.001^365=1.44. Or, your daily return is 1.001. Invest $10 and you’ll have $10.01 by the end of day one.

And now, if ye have choice, go up to the land, and remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.\n\nLaman and Lemuel don’t want to be in the wilderness, but when Nephi tells them they have their agency, they’re not brave enough to go back to Jerusalem.\nIn other words, he catches them in their rouse. “Nobody’s forcing you”, go back if you want, but if you do you’ll remember that you’re going to die there.\nHow often do we like to complain about something but not actually do anything about it? Reminds me of the quote “So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” (Revelation 3.16)\nIf you don’t want to do anything about it, don’t complain. Vote with your feet, not your mouth. (They were voting with their feet to leave Jerusalem but voting with their mounts against it.)\n\n\n\nIf you’re gonna walk, walk. If you’re gonna follow the prophet, follow.\n\n\n\n\n16 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to pass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they sought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts. 1 Nephi 7.15–16\n\nAlso interesting is how they didn’t directly want to kill Nephi (didn’t have the courage here to try), but instead just decided to leave him to die (Joseph of Egypt style).\nThis is one of those “I’m not actually sinning because I didn’t do the sin” things. Tying someone up isn’t killing them. Should they die, that’s an unfortunate derivative consequence. But we didn’t kill him. 1\nBacking up to a higher point: how often do we skirt the issue and not take full accountability? They can’t go back to Jerusalem and they can’t even properly attempt murder. They’re just lazy and without conviction all around.\nBut so are we. We all have these tendencies to disassociate from accountability for our life:\n\nwell X person is annoying. “Are you going to talk to them?” No…\nEtc…\n\nOwn up. # Other Verses of Interest\nToday I liked these verses:\n\nWherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto those who are not of the world. 1 Nephi 6.5\n\nAm I someone who is not of this world? Fascinating question because it makes me wonder what is “the world”. What was Nephibtrying to define here? Perhaps he was summarizing in his own way that those who have their head in the spiritual clouds will love these things, while those who live by “the world” won’t. It’s also reflective of his experience trying to share the gospel that some people don’t care. They just want to enjoy the pineapples and what not. Am I distracted by money, fame, greed, envy?\n\nI also got a little ahead and listened to this scripture:\n\nFor it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot. 1 Nephi 11.1\n\nMy kids love to come up to my phone and say “let me see!!!” If they hear audio in another room they come sprinting.\nWhy do kids love seeing? They want to see. They’re sponges. They’re also without much experience in life so they want to see it all! Make up for lost time…\nTo become like a little child is to want to see for ourselves.\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Some believe in pre-destiny. That their life is predetermined.\nSome believe there is no God and they have to do the best they can with what they’ve got, because that’s all they’ve got.\nThe truth lies somewhere in between. There is a God, and He wants us to be agents (Doctrine and Covenants 58.28).\n In data science, there’s a concept called “coalesce”. In English it means to come together and make one whole. In software, it means to fill in missing data with a default value.\nForgive the nerd talk, but bear with me here: So if you have an empty spreadsheet, and you do the operation coalesce(spreadsheet, 5) it would return the spreadsheet’s value if you had data in the spreadsheet but the number 5 if you had a missing cell. So if you have 10 rows of data in Excel but 3 missing rows, the output would be the 7 original values with 3 cells now with 5 in them. It’s a way of handling missing data, because missing data creates problems.\nWhat is the missing data in our personal lives? It’s “what do we do?” What do we do today? Tomorrow? Next year? What do we do today and tomorrow to prepare for the thing we may want to do next year?\nI’ve realized the healthy way to have a relationship with personal revelation is to operate under the constraints of a coalesce. To be whole and one with the Lord, our goal should be to coalesce.\nSome rely too much on the spirit. Hoping God will make a choice for us. But he gave us agency. He lost 1/3 of his children because he didn’t want to give up agency. And, by that right, he’s willing to lose you and me too if we’re not willing to exercise our agency. We just choose. This is life. And we must choose Him.\nIn many things, there is a commandment we can rely on. Don’t kill. Don’t steal. Be honest. Pay tithing.\nThat’s the priority.\nThen there’s the gray area stuff: love our neighbor.\nThat’s the agency.\nThen there’s the really gray area: have joy. Among this is “provide for a family” and “raise them the best way you can”.\nSo, use a coalesce. Your default value is what you want to do. That’s what you fill in.\nOur life should be coalesce(personal revelation, our agency).\nWhere there’s a commandment or personal revelation from the Lord, do it. Don’t wait. Do it. Follow the prompting. Otherwise, if you have no prompting or commandment to follow, make a choice! Learn. Experience. Enjoy.\nI believe the Lord will support us when we follow a pattern of putting Him first, and then defaulting to doing many good things of our own free will and choice when He hasn’t given us instruction.\nThat doesn’t mean he doesn’t care what we do. He cares deeply. It’s just more like Ether 2.23 where he wants us to come up with some good ideas.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Scriptures\nThe Isaiah chapters in Nephi often get skipped. But if you skip them, we miss out on important doctrine, like how “baptism” appears in the Nephi version of Isaiah 48 but not in the King James Version.\n\nHearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or out of the waters of baptism, who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in truth nor in righteousness. 1 Nephi 20.1\n\n\n\n\nBaptism\n\n\nBut if you compare to Isaiah 48, that line is not mentioned:\n\nHear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness. Isaiah 48.1\n\nThe only reference to baptism in the Old Testament is found only in the chapter heading of 1 Kings 7:\n\nThe molten sea (baptismal font) rests on the backs of twelve oxen. 1 Kings 7\n\nThis is clearly one of the “plain and precious” things taken, or lost in translation, from the Bible:\n\nthey have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away. 1 Nephi 13.26\n\nBut we know they practiced baptism in the Old Testament because Nephi lived and taught it, and the Pearl of Great Price talks about Adam’s baptism and ordination into the priesthood:\n\nAnd it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. 65 And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man. 66 And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever; 67 And thou art after the order of him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity. 68 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons. Amen. Moses 6.64–68\n\n\n\nMeaning\n\nIt was cool to notice this today, as that verse popped out to me and that word “baptism”. It makes me wonder what else was taken from these Isaiah chapters\nHow could Joseph Smith have ideated that baptism was in the Old Testament? All records we have are that Joseph wasn’t very literate or well known in the Bible. He didn’t even know that Jerusalem had a wall and had to ask Emma (Saints Book 1 The Standard of Truth 1815-1846) This strengthens my testimony that he was inspired in translating it\nIt makes sense to me how valuable the Book of Mormon is to answer these longstanding questions.\nThose who are of the house of Israel are those who are baptized. The baptized are adopted into the Abrahamic family. This is is consistent with Galatians 3:\n\n\nFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise. Galatians 3.27–29\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "I’m reading the Book of Mormon this year with the Come Follow Me (by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) curriculum. I hope you enjoy as I write something I learn each day.\nI’ll tag things “scripture of the day” for any one-scripture thoughts. If it’s related to the Come Follow Me theme, l’ll add a tag.\n\nMiracles of Christ\nThis scripture caught me eye:\n\nFor behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases. Mosiah 3.5\n\n\n\n\nChrist healing all who come unto him\n\n\nI have seen miracles in my life. I’ve also seen collateral-miracles, which is the miracle that happens when you’re expecting one thing but another thing happens instead.\nI’ve seen someone healed from a Priesthood blessing. I’ve seen someone healed from depression. I’ve seen someone healed from doubt and disbelief. I’ve felt the power of the Holy Ghost in my life.\nI’ve also seen people not healed, left to the struggles we all face, and yet miracles abound.\nSo what is a miracle? Is it an outcome? No. It’s the process of seeing how an event can be changed by God for the benefit of an individual. Occasionally, there are supernatural changes in the natural course of things.\nIf any of these things sounds fanciful to those not of my Church, it’s actually a lot more simple and plain than it sounds. Because “the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.” (1 Kings 19.11–12) For me, seeing a miracle of Christ is perceiving the hand by how he operates.\nSome have a hard time reading the Old Testament because how can a God who brought fire from heaven, parted the seas, gave manna from heaven also be a God who doesn’t do those things today?\nI’d argue the miracles of Christ have risen to the point where he works according to our knowledge and insight. I believe in a Christ who is the source of all truth, and who teaches truth (even scientific) to everyone, regardless of their belief system. Matthew 5.45\nAnd so, the miracles of God today are happening within science. Within tech. He doesn’t have to heal us by God’s power if he gave us medicine to do the same.\nHe also doesn’t show his miracles the same way. The people of the Old Testament were simple. They needed signs. But signs aren’t faith, and I believe these days before His second coming are days of greater faith. Days where we’ll have fewer signs.\n\nTherefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe. Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe. 18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it. Alma 32.16–18\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "One thing I’ve seen a lot of people, including myself, do is try to change other people.\n\n\n\nCome on! Why won’t you change colors?\n\n\nI’m not sure why this is or why we do this. Perhaps we want others to be happier and we feel in our own egos that we know the better way. Perhaps we want our own problems to go away. Etc. etc.\nThe gospel isn’t about healing others. The gospel of Jesus is about individuals coming to Him for personal healing.\nWe can pray for others, sure. But what’s the point of that prayer?\n\nTo ask Heaven to send good vibes to someone else or,\nto have the process of praying change our own hearts. (The Power of Habitual Prayer)\n\nWhen we pray, it changes us. What changes us? He does. Heavenly Father changes us through the power of the Savior’s atonement. Prayer is never about changing other people’s hearts, even if you pray their heart might be softened. But by praying for their heart to be softened, it actually softens your own heart.\nWhen Alma and their people prayed for deliverance from captivity, they prayed for softened hearts:\n\nTherefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites… Mosiah 23.28\n\nThe hearts softened, but the more important thing that happened is that they developed enough faith in the Lord in order to be able to sneak out and not be afraid of being hunted down or what not. Like the Israelites in Egypt it can be dangerous to just go into the desert. Takes a lot of faith. But the prayers and Miracles of Moses softened the Israelite’s hearts and prepared them to follow Moses.\nBut what about Alma praying for his kids?\n\nBehold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith. Mosiah 27.14\n\nSurely this is about God sending an angel to change someone. Pray hard and miracles happen, even if they don’t see an angel.\nBut the reality is more nuanced.\n\nAnd now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off. Mosiah 27.16\n\nThe angel didn’t come to change Alma.\nBut you’d think there would be a strong correlation between seeing an angel and changing your ways though, right? A piece of counter evidence is found with Laman and Lemuel who were visited by an angel while bearing up Nephi:\n\nAnd after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us? 1 Nephi 3.31\n\nOr what about the people who saw Jesus heal and then condemn him for doing so on a Sunday? Evidence abounds that spiritual encounters don’t forcibly change us. Angelic visitations don’t change us. Jesus appearing to people didn’t change them.\nThis is agency. This is Heavenly Father’s plan.\nWhen Alma saw the angel, the angel said “I’m visiting you to answer the prayers of your dad.” So yes, absolutely, the Lord does things on our behalf because we pray. But he doesn’t change us.\nThis very same angel gave Alma an out: “even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off”…The angel gave agency. But Alma could easily have acted like Laman and Lemuel or the Pharisees and hardened his heart. It’s also why the Lord was able to do many miracles in the Americas that he couldn’t do in Jerusalem (3 Nephi): they had faith. They chose to follow Him. They had agency.\nThe gospel isn’t about us changing others through prayer. It’s about us allowing the Savior to change our hearts. This same scripture could be applied when trying to change another person:\n\nwhy beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Matthew 7.3\n\nOr this:\n\nWhen we feel hurt, angry, or envious, it is quite easy to judge people. This topic could actually be taught in a two-word sermon. When it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or wanting to cause harm, please apply the following:\n\n\nStop it! Uchtdorf\n\nInstead, find the good in others. Focus on changing and improving yourself to be more understanding, more accepting, more go with the flow.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

It’s empowering to know that he’s already suffered for my sins of today and yesterday as well as tomorrow and beyond. Meaning, he already knows the mistakes I’m going to choose to make, which is kind of trippy in a way, but also comforting thinking about how He still loves me and knows how I’ll falter. That brings me peace knowing He knows me, who I am today, who I’ll develop into tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Consider innocent children starving across the world, being bombed in Gaza/raped in Israel, bombed in Ukraine, Yemen, gassed in Germany in the Holocaust, starved in Stalin’s camps, nuked by the United States in Japan, etc, etc, etc. (I sincerely don’t write this easily, nor to make light of the suffering.) all of the suffering is horrible. But it doesn’t for a moment mean God doesn’t exist. It actually affirms His existence, because if evil exists the opposite of evil must too.↩︎\nI don’t mean that in the Marxist political sense, because who’s to declare who’s suffering at any given moment? Is an affluent child born with cancer not a sufferer despite them not being poor?↩︎\nConsider this in a humorous way: Why didn’t He say “oh sorry!! Please come back! I’ve got a quota of disciples to reach and if I don’t have you with me…””↩︎\nI love how instead of engaging with the Pharisees, He “withdrew” from them and “healed them all”, kind of as a divine rebel just saying, “you’re mad about me healing one guy on the Sabbath?

    "text": "Scriptures\nNephi explains why he writes the words of Isaiah in his record:\n\nFor I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him. And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words. 2 Nephi 11.2–3\n\nFirst, he read the words and enjoyed reading them. Second, he identified with Isaiah - he felt a common bond with him, namely that they had both seen the Redeemer. Third, He wants to establish a testimony to his posterity by saying “Isaiah saw it, but Jacob and I did too. And there will be others as well.”\n # Meaning\nCan I say I’ve seen my Redeemer?\nNephi wasn’t Moses. He wasn’t the son of Moses. He was the son of a dad who was called to preach to people. There were many prophets like Lehi, per 1 Nephi 1. But Lehi was chosen to leave. Nephi was diligent in His duties.\nSeeing the Redeemer is a spiritual event. Moroni was visited by the Lord, “And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus.” (Mormon 1.15)\nIf we recall, many were visited by Jesus and saw him with their physical eyes and didn’t recognize Him (Matthew 16.15-17).\nThen there was King Lamoni who also experienced a spiritual witness of the Lord: “For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name.” (Alma 19.13) Was King Lamoni a prophet? No. A week before this spiritual experience he was sentencing his servants to death for not taking good enough care of his flocks.\nI’m not sure there is a pre-requisite to “seeing” the Lord. I’m also not sure that seeing him with your literal eyes is important at all. But gaining a witness from the Holy Ghost that Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Chosen One on whom we rely on for forgiveness…this is what matters. If ye seek, ye shall find.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "The other side may say (as Hyndman) does), I might as well believe in the Tooth Fairy, or Santa, because I don’t have evidence they don’t exist. Fair. Then belief is a choice, and must follow the principle of “by their fruits ye shall know them”. Did Baal call down Fire? No, only Elijah’s God. “Was that story of the Bible invented?” Perhaps. If so, explain why living Christ’s gospel brings me joy? “Because they’re good principles”, well, what is good, if not God? “Well then why not Zeus, or Baal to be your God?”, because I believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - not the God of Baal. I believe the scriptures because they teach good things. “What about the misogyny, racism, war and killing in the Bible etc etc etc”, well, perhaps some was commanded by God for reasons and context we don’t have. Perhaps some of the Bible isn’t truely written. “If some isn’t true it’s all not true because parts of it say it’s all true”. Well, what’s true is true, what’s not isn’t. “Who’s to say what God inspired?” Well, who’s to say what’s not inspired? Only God. “We’re not getting anywhere”. Ahh, but we are. Because I believe in God, and after believing Him I exercised faith in His son to pray on His name and open myself to trying to follow His ways. I’m far from perfect, but once I did this, I received spiritual knowledge, and having seen more of the Hand of God in my life, I can say there are miracles of events I can’t explain by chance or delusion alone. Miracles only a loving God could produce. This is my knowledge, which follows faith. Alma 32.34–36 And we also have the Book of Mormon, which is a powerful second witness of Christ that brought reality to the truth in the Bible, and continually helps me feel the fruits of the Spirit, which is the Holy Ghost telling me it’s true.↩︎\nmy whole life until 21 I had no idea Joseph Smith had so many (up to 42) wives. “Some say he was a womanizer, pimp, etc”. Perhaps. But perhaps he was a prophet commanded to do so. Were we there? God at one point commanded Abraham to raise seed and have many wives. “Maybe Abraham was a philanderer too.” Okay, but does that definition of chastity and virtue not depend on the very construction of marriage as ordained by God who married Adam and Eve as husband and wife? If it’s from God, it’s His law, and He chose the rules. “But Joseph altered the rules and made stuff up so he could get with women and teenagers.” Perhaps. That assumes we know him, he told us that, and he believed it to be true. So we’ll leave it as an opinion. In my opinion he followed a commandment from an Angel, despite me not understanding it entirely or being comfortable with the idea. Let the man speak for himself.↩︎"

Crazy to think about what could come of that.\nI have to remind myself I’m only 14 days solidly into this. I barely even know what’s going on.

    "text": "It felt like a Sturdys but k was a Friday.\nI had to let someone go today who wasn’t doing their job. I guess I was worried about it at the onset. I don’t want to hire someone who has red flags. It means you have to onboard them and people get used to them and then they have to go.\nBut is what it is. I ended up hiring someone who learned SEO from the person I let go. How did I know? They used the same template.\nStill at 1515. Waiting for lots of deals to drop next week. Maybe mine will. I just need one more to stop losing money.\nSo many bits of minutia. Am I really going to keep doing this? i think so. It’s easy to just pour hours into though. Will it be worth my ROI? I don’t know.

    "text": "When I walked into #Google I was so excited to learn how to code like the pros. The only coding I truly learned was the recurring daily complaint by the engineers there “oh, I’m just moving protos again today”.\nMoving protos…what?\nProtobufs, or protos as they’re affectionately called, are a type of configuration file. And Google’s architecture is so advanced that fewer folks spend time coding and more time manipulating protos to improve the software.\nWhy? Because software 2.0 is impossible to automate or code. Why? The book Power and Prediction explains how future software has trillions of possible combinations of design.\n#YouTube has a deep learning algorithm called Brain that has one main job: figure out the probability a person will click on a video.\nOn top of this, they do what all recommendation systems do: they customize the diversity of content or the categories of content. Do you want more videos similar to video X? Do you want more educational content, but very different video?\nAll recommendation systems operate like this: an ML model at the base and then rules and configurations to overlay on top. And the protos control the configurations. And the software engineers analyze the metrics coming from your “watch time”. Their job is then to manipulate the proto files to improve the system.\nSo when they “move protos” all day long, they’re just getting systems to talk to each other.\n“How should I configure my ___ pipeline?” - asked every engineer ever. Here I take a dive into ways that I’ve seen #machinelearning pipelines be configured.\nhttps://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/configurations-for-ml-pipelines.html\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "I posted on Friday on Facebook that I’m starting a local SEO business. A few interesting things happened:\n\nA coworker from an internship in 2012 reached out to me saying her company needs help with this. Meeting booked next Wednesday\nA mentor from my youth reached out cryptically saying “call me if you want to tell me about what your doing”\nA person said “everything you just wrote describes what I’m feeling”. Meeting booked Monday\nMy Filipino cold caller found someone who at least listened to me. 10% chance of going through is higher than 0%. My Filipino cost me $0 because he’s on a $300 commission (half of a whole months pay)\nMy own mother in law signed up. I hadn’t even thought of her.\nI got maybe 2-4 other solid leads from things that could be a great match.\n\n8 hours replying to each person who liked my post. I want to build a community - not just spam people. These 60 likes are my fans. People who like me enough to like it. Or like what I’m doing.\n$390 in recurring revenue. If Monday drops I’m at maybe +$225. That’s $615. My phone center is $220/mo. My callers are free. My virtual assistant to help me is $500/mo. I’m a few hundred from breakeven. I still don’t even know how to make a Google business profile, the thing I’m selling.\nBut I understand what’s going on, so I can sell. I just haven’t done it yet.\nBut I’m gonna learn.\nTakeaways:\n\n10% chance of success &gt; 0% chance. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. To build, put yourself in situations where you start off with a 10% but then get to the point of being able to be at 30% on the 20th try. Most of the time we prefer to be at 0% chance of success than 1%.\nQuickest way to make money, and perhaps the only way, is to ask someone for it and offer them something more valuable to them in return. That’s it. If you don’t know what’s more valuable to them than their money, just ask them.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

To invoke the divine on behalf of all of us with great charity and love, and to pursue the available happiness in all circumstances beyond our control. And to pursue better circumstances within my control. And to ask for sacred circumstances only accessible through asking and only gift able under His control.\n\n\nContext\nI read The Happiest Man on Earth and wondered: how do I take Eddie’s story and use it to better my life. That was His wish after all “I do not seek revenge. I chose to have a happy life - the greatest revenge possible.”\nJust because life is worse for others it dormant mean I can’t improve my own. It’s bad for others. It’s been worse for me. It’s been better for me. It’s been worse for Christ. But Eddie wants us all to experience happiness.\nThis is a prayer of perspective. Of acceptance.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Elon Musk pay package from Tesla denied by Delaware judge | AP News\n\n\n\nWages\n\n\nKind of an interesting idea - what if you took the hours he worked to figure out what his hourly rate was. It’s been 7521 days since July 1, 2003, the day Tesla incorporated. That means his work has been worth 7.312M dollars per day. A quick search shows Tesla’s revenue was 81Bn in 2022, about 221M per day. So his comp is just 3% of current daily revenue.\nI’m sure I’m missing something, like how much he’s been comped in the past. But 3% for making a company what it is doesn’t seem unreasonable. Of course, that’s not 3% on last year. That’s like 67% of 2022 revenue. Indeed that’s a lot.\nMan, getting paid $7m per day is a lot of money. With $55M (assuming post tax) money he could buy literally every house in my town, at a premium of 50%. Imagine: a town called Elon. Or he could finally afford Twitter 🧐.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

The things you see when you open doors affect your brain state. Your brain can only hold so much. If you live in clutter you have clutter. So the things you see in your house should reflect what you can hold in memory.\n\nToys should have a theme (blocks, action figures, doll house).

Don’t have it in the pantry. Put it in the corner thing. Cereal every day? Put that front and center.\n\nThen long-storage is the hard drive. It’s about keeping stuff you know you’ll want.

It only got me angry.\nThe point of learning something is to take action and create positive change in the world. If I learn about things I don’t plan to take action on,\nif that sounds uneducated, another reason to learn something is to gain empathy and change my perspective. However, the global news is generally biased by the wars for subscriptions between a handful of editors.\nNiche news is far more educative. I’ve subscribed to blogs, to specific influencers in my field, etc. I’ve learned things from these people that I can apply that day in my job. I’m subscribing to things that feed my career.\nlong form content is far better way to understand current events. If you want to understand the state of the world, read a book on it. Most major geopolitical events are insanely complicated and cannot be surmised in 126 characters. Read a few books on the things you care about.\nthere’s so much thought put into even a low quality book. Think about it: most books get reviewed by editors in the very least. They probably get read once or twice at least by the original authors. So what would be a better time for your energy - a low quality book or a set of posts on LinkedIn likely generated by ChatGPT or Jasper.ai? If a low quality book &gt; than a tweet, surely 30 min a day of a high quality book (easy to find) is worth more than most low quality content.\nI broke my iPhone in 2020 and waited 45 days for a replacement. But it wasn’t fully broken - the screen was hopelessly shattered on the bottom half where typing is required. So I kept it in my drawer and only used it when I needed to. The risk of using it? Getting a shard of glass stuck in my finger. I wish I still had that to some degree because it forced me to be focused. I realized very few people texted me anything urgent that couldn’t wait a few days. I could still call people with Siri, but nobody called. We’re optimized to be addicted. That’s literally the goal of these phones and the apps on them. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just not in our best interest.\nI tried using a junk $40 replacement phone I found in my closet while waiting those 45 days to get my iPhone replacement. The phone was from 2015 when I got married - it was a teaser phone from the cell company. It probably downloaded at 2 mbp/s. Any time I clicked a link I had to wait 15-20 seconds for the page to load.\n\nI was amazed. I was shocked this piece of junk actually could take notes. Could email. Could browse the internet. But I also learned not to click on things unless it was worth 30 seconds of my time.\nHow do I spend my time now? Not wisely enough. A lot of things should be done on a computer. Most things should be planned. Few things are urgent. Fewer are essential.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Just watched this clip:\n\nImportant discussion points: as a novice you’re worried about where to go or picking the wrong thing.\nI remember not taking an opportunity to learn C++ because “that’s not what I want to do”. In another occasion I wanted to learn PySpark over SQL because Python…\nWhile I don’t regret that choice per se, because I chose something else I was interested in, I’ve largely come to realize that I don’t care what programming language I’m using. I care about getting the job done.\nAlso, I’m probably over the 10,000 hours of something, I just don’t know what. Am I an ML expert? Data expert? SQL? Python? R?\nIs it the application of the skill that makes you an expert? I’m not sure. Because I think novices can do some incredible things if they hone in.\nIf you read one book on a topic, you’re by no means an “expert”, but you probably know more about that topic than 99% of the nation. I learned this when I spent 6 months diving into the home security industry for my first job. Pretty sure I knew more about that than anyone I spoke to. Was I an expert? I really only had maybe 300 hours. Maybe I was inexperienced. Sure.\nAnd who spends literally 10,000 hours on any one thing? Like 10,000 hours on XGBoost? Image classification? Deep learning? Machine learning? A/B testing? Spreadsheets? Generalist vs specialist, etc. if you’re an ML scientist at Google, you worry about very different things than an ML scientist at a startup. At a startup, you worry about your bigquery allocation and pipeline failures. At Google you worry about what your 5th skip VP is going to deprecate that month.\nThat’s just the nature of education. There are so many things in the world to know…that being an “expert” is a relative thing. But I agree that working hard and learning useful things helps you innovate faster.\n\n\n\nI’d change my opinion on being an expert if I needed to beat Rocky.\n\n\nLast thing, the crux is: don’t compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to yourself. That’s how you assess your progress.\nBut I’d argue: why even compare yourself to yourself? Compare your solution to the problem. Does it matter if you have 10,000 hours? No. What matters is if the solution fits. This is why innovations and disruptions come from unexpected places: because novices can nail solutions.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Moods flow. Keep the negative waves at bay\n\n\nThere’s no question that moods are contagious. I once asked someone at the beach to leash their dog, and they slightly rebuked me, “this is a dog friendly beach.” Well, so it is, I thought, grumpily. I complained to a family member about this grumpy dog owner.\nMoods escalate. And negative moods are even more pervasive and contagious than positive ones. They say a disgruntled customer tells more friends and family than happy ones. Why is this?\nIn the “Black Cat” (The Best of Edgar Allen Poe), Poe describes a gruesome tale man who wanted to do evil just for the sake of it. That it’s in his nature. Not because you want to do the thing, but because you want to do a forbidden thing. The same goes the other way, for sure. But I think we trend slightly pessimistic because being an optimist is more beneficial, more rewarding and therefore more difficult.\nA leader once told me when I was managing a team, “They’ll pick up on everything you do or say.” Oddly, I was picking up on what he was saying.\nSo when you lead, lead carefully. Whether in home or work, lead with kindness, compassion, and restraint. Speak three kind words before a negative. Ask to understand before assuming. Lead as a servant. It takes all the effort to overcome negative vibes, and who better equipped than the leader to do it?\nDon’t be Moriarty:\n\n“Why can’t you be more hopeful for a change?”\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Efficiency is knowing what to work on. Discipline is the ability to overcome the excitement of a new idea and place it in proper context of all ideas.

    "text": "An Example\nI build data science models by building python packages and committing the code to GitHub. The python package contains all of the support files and a main.py file to run the pipeline from start to finish. The support files could contain either helpful loggers to tell me where the pipeline is breaking down, diagnostic tools such as an AUC-ROC plot, files to engineer features, or files to train different model types. So there are really these three things that could happen to my code at any time. It doesn’t matter where those changes occur, or how many lines of code changed. What matters is what’s happened to the model. Each time I get a pull request approved, I’ll update the version number in my repo.\n\nChanging BETWEEN\nIncrement the BETWEEN version for the following changes:\n\nWhen the structure of your data changes\nIf your target variable changes (how you coded it, or data that produced the target changed)\nThe underlying population you’re training on changes\n\nAssume I discovered that I had a bad join. The join change might have been a minor one, but it’s now difficult to really compare the two models because my target was affected as a result. What I was predicting, even if slightly different, is now something different. If you ever feel like you’re comparing apples to oranges when looking at an AUC-ROC curve, update the BETWEEN version.\nWith each BETWEEN change, there should be a clear communication in the release notes of why the model is inherently different from prior models. These changes should be less frequent.\n\n\nChanging WITHIN\nIncrement the WITHIN number when the following happens:\n\nFeatures are added\nData sources are added or updated. (You might have several data sources today that help contribute to the target. But adding a data source might just mean adding new features. If you add data in such a way that it changes what you’re ultimately modeling, update the BETWEEN version.)\nNew modeling types are added. (You might be using a logistic regression, but add a mo)\n\nSo if I added files that allowed me to train different model types, or added files that engineered new features, I’d incrememnt the WITHIN version. In my mind, this shouldn’t be a count of features you include, but should just be incremented every time you do something that affects the model performance.\nAt any time, you might what to view different subsets of features and their effect on the model. So, you might not change the number of features, but add some functionality into your pipeline that now produces three different models in each run. I would increment the WITHIN version number in that case.\nRemember, the goal of this type of versioning is to show generally what’s changed in your pipeline.\n\n\nChanging PROCESS\nIncrement the PROCESS version when the following happens:\n\nA minor bug is fixed (unless this updates BETWEEN or WITHIN)\nEnhance a logger or aspect of the pipeline\nAdd a diagnostic plot or table\n\nBasically, any time you add something that doesn’t ultimately affect the performance of the model, you should update the PROCESS version. Your changes might improve the flow of your code and make you a much happier developer, but if it doesn’t improve the model, then the key priority of your code hasn’t improved."

    "text": "The book Dune is amazing in many ways, but the one that piqued my curiosity today was this: what if water was a currency?\nThe book gives great reverence to water, specifically talking about the lengths the Fremen go to to preserve their water. They even harvest it the dead, as water is life. They see people around them as water vessels. If you’re 100 kg (220lbs), they say you carry 60 kg of water weight. That’s a 60 liters. If you drink an average of 2 liters per day, that’s enough water to sustain you for 30 days. Fascinating how you would die without drinking water for a week though, right?\nSome on this earth live with such water scarcity. Most in the US don’t.

Where did”st nick” come from?”\n\nThe concept of Santa Claus has evolved over many centuries, originating from the historical figure of Saint Nicholas. Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century Christian bishop in Myra, which is now part of modern-day Turkey. He was known for his generosity and for performing miracles, which earned him a reputation as a protector of children and sailors.\n\n\nThe name “Santa Claus” evolved from the Dutch “Sinterklaas,” a short form of Sint Nikolaas (Saint Nicholas). Dutch immigrants brought the traditions of Sinterklaas to America in the 17th and 18th centuries. In these traditions, Sinterklaas was depicted as a serious, religious figure who rewarded good children and punished the naughty ones.\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, especially in America, the image of Santa Claus as we know it today began to take shape. The 1823 poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” (commonly known as “Twas the Night Before Christmas”) played a crucial role in shaping the modern character of Santa Claus, including his physical appearance and the tradition of delivering gifts to children.\n\n\nLater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, Santa’s image was further popularized through various media, including advertisements, films, and songs, which contributed to the jovial, red-suited, and reindeer-driving character recognized globally today. This character represents a blend of the historical Saint Nicholas, folk traditions from various cultures, and modern commercial and media influences.\n\nHow did St Nick become red?\n\nThe transformation of Saint Nicholas into the red-suited Santa Claus is a gradual evolution influenced by cultural, artistic, and commercial factors. The image of Santa Claus wearing red clothes began to become popular in the 19th century, but it was solidified in the 20th century, particularly through advertising.\n\n\n\n19th Century Literature and Art: In the 19th century, Santa Claus was often depicted in various colors of robes, including blue, green, and brown. However, by the latter half of the 19th century, the image of Santa in a red suit began to appear more frequently in literature and illustrations. Thomas Nast, a prominent American cartoonist, played a significant role in popularizing this image. In his illustrations for Harper’s Weekly starting in the 1860s, Nast depicted Santa Claus in a variety of outfits, including the now-familiar red suit.\n\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Advertising in the 20th Century: The standardized image of Santa Claus in a red suit with white fur trim was popularized and became iconic largely due to Coca-Cola advertising campaigns. In 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to create a Santa Claus for their Christmas advertising campaign. Sundblom’s Santa was jolly, rotund, and dressed in a red suit with white fur trim, which matched the company’s color scheme. These advertisements were widely circulated and became immensely popular, cementing the image of Santa Claus in a red suit in the public’s imagination.\n\n\n\nWhile the red-suited Santa Claus is now ubiquitous, it’s important to note that the evolution of his image was influenced by a blend of historical, cultural, and commercial factors over several decades.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Now there are 126,000 tokens. 30x improvement. So to do another 30x improvement is 3.76M. So yea, by next year you should be able to just load the entire RAG database into memory. But…gonna be super expensive.\nPoint is: would GPT be this effective if it was using RAG over a database? Or is it more effective loading it all into context?\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I also have “personal” and “work” tags which have projects within them, so I don’t really see why I’d need to duplicate this. On second thought, each task can only belong to one work project so it’d make sense for this to be my grouping. I suppose I just don’t want to manage all that. Or, I chose to use tags to manage my projects because I was cheap and I can only have 9 lists on the free version but unlimited tags?

    "text": "When I co-started a company several years ago, my founders and I would canvass neighborhoods knocking doors. We’d discuss our ideas for a new product one door at a time. After each conversation, the product took a new form. Eventually, the product took shape and we had a successful kickstarter launch.\nSince that time, I’ve thought about how valuable it was to get information straight from the source.\nAlberto Savoia’s new book, “The Right It”, is re-teaching me this principle. Data beats opinions, he says. In another book I’m reading, “Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments”, the former CEO of Netscape is quoted saying,\n\nIf we have data, let’s go with data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine. - Jim Barksdale\n\nData sourced from your manager, your stakeholder, or your customer are invaluable to help you know if you’re solving their problem. Too often it’s easy to get stuck in the original solution that comes to our mind.\nData from customers directly shape the product. Data sourced at scale from online experiments refine it.\nOpinions from the customer shape the product. Their behavior (captured as data) speaks louder than their words. Frequently, it’s challenging to correlate the two. We’re left to guess why someone actually clicked, bought, churned. It’s a beautiful cycle.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Last night I went to a tapas style restaurant. I got 5 things. Then we opted for one more: battered cod tacos. Our taste buds rewarded us. That’s why we came.\nBefore that I was telling my wife, “I don’t see why my friend didn’t like the sushi. It’s fine. I just don’t know how to evaluate if something is worth it or not. Because it’s tasty, I’d recommend it…” This came off the heels of multiple times recently where I’ve gone out with people who are foodies that criticize the meal I’m enjoying and I’m left wondering: am I a food plebe?\nExperiencing this last night was poignant. The whole meal was good. Not bad. Just good.\nThen came the fish tacos.\nThat’s how it is with reading. You need to read a lot before the good and the bad start filtering out.\nAnd like fish tacos, maybe there are even better ones out there, but I needed this one to point me in the direction of what’s possible.\nAnd to some degree, there’s a dulling of sensitivities. If you haven’t read good literature in a long while perhaps you assume it’s all fine and “why not finish this book?”\nBut this year I’m trying to read many authors across many genres to tackle just that: find the books I really enjoy reading. And then ask myself, “why? What was special there?” So that I know what to look for next.\nLast night I began The Old Man and the Sea and it was a fish taco moment. I don’t know how I’ve avoided this book so long. I’m sure I read it in like sixth grade, but does that even count? And why have I largely avoided fiction for most of my adult life? I suppose having studied something very technical in college it pushed me to stop using that side of my brain. But getting back to good books, written with such depth and creative imagination, renew me with an awareness of the dullness of business books I’ve been dwelling in.\n\n\n\nAn Old Man and His Tacos\n\n\nAnd now, for ChatGPT to answer the prompt: “in the style of Ernest Hemingway, write three paragraphs about a man eating fish tacos”:\n\nIn the style of Ernest Hemingway, characterized by his terse and direct prose, the tale unfolds on a weathered pier stretching into the gray, restless sea. The man, solitary and rugged, sits at the edge where the wood meets the water, a plate of fish tacos beside him. His hands, calloused and strong, deftly assemble the tacos with an economy of movement that speaks of a life shaped by necessity rather than choice. The fish, freshly caught, bears the scent of the ocean, a fragrance as old as time, mingling with the sharp tang of lime and cilantro.\nAround him, the world seems to hold its breath, the only sounds are the soft lapping of waves against the pilings and the distant cries of gulls, wheeling like specters in the overcast sky. He bites into a taco, the crispness of the tortilla giving way to the tender fish within, a simplicity that belies the depth of flavors. There’s a harmony here, between man and nature, a momentary peace found in the act of eating, of sustaining oneself with the bounty of the sea.\nAs he eats, his gaze is drawn to the horizon, where the gray of the sea blends indistinguishably with the sky. There’s a contemplation in his eyes, a man adrift in his thoughts as he is in life, finding solace in the simple pleasure of a meal. The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself—uncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction. In this moment, on this pier, the man and the sea are one, their stories intertwined in the quiet, unspoken understanding that life, in all its forms, is a series of solitary moments shared with the world.\n\nDang…“life shaped by necessity rather than choice” and “The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself—uncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction.” I’m glad Ernest is somewhere in there, AI. You may have a soul after all.\nSee also: Reading Ethos\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "My Advice for New Career People",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The keys for me for job satisfaction are now pretty basic:\n\nIs my manager supportive and someone I like spending time with?\nIs the work continuously interesting? Will I develop skills that are likely to bring interesting opportunities in the future?\nIs there incentive alignment between what I offer and what the company needs?\n\nThis blog post will attempt to describe my thoughts on what makes for a fulfilling career. It’s a hard question. Maybe something in here is valuable as you search for your “ideal” career.\n\nLikely useless career advice\nNow for a stream of consciousness about corporate employment…\nSome say a job should help you 1) earn or 2) learn and if neither then leave. But that framework doesn’t really work because you can learn anything anywhere.\nKnowledge is accretive. As I look back on jobs I didn’t love, I still learned things. I wasn’t a fan of the type of consulting I was doing 10 years ago, but I’ve now started a consulting firm and having had that experience is helpful. So it’s all kind of gray. I didn’t like pulling weeds as a kid but I’m now pulling weeds as a homeowner so yea, I’m glad I know how to do that.\n\n\nwhat is life anyway?\nPer Guide to Decision Making, “resulting” may apply if you say you made a good decision because you enjoyed a job. By the same token you made a bad decision because you didn’t enjoy the job.\nThe reality is that “all or nothing thinking” is more of a cognitive bias, per The Coddling of the American Mind and The Worry Cure. And so, you’re going to learn things as long as you’re remotely interested in learning things. Whether they satisfy your Working Genius is another matter.\n\n\nI want my “dream” job though\nCan you land your dream job? Or is it a myth? 30-40% of first time marriages end in divorce. And not all of the remaining 70-60% are blissfully happy either. But many of those 70% ARE blissfully happy. Or they will be. Or they were and they will be again maybe or something…\nMarriage and work are similar: they’re a type of relationship.\nHappiness in a relationship takes both people being committed to the happiness of the other. One sided relationships eventually crumble. But if both people remain committed to the other’s happiness, and other certain caveats…, the marriage will prove valuable to both for their whole lives.\n\n\nProfessional and Life happiness\nHappiness to me comes in two forms: doing the best I can with the circumstances I have (the cards I’ve been dealt) and choosing environments that are healthy (the game that gives me the cards).\nIt’s about 1) what you’re doing and 2) the environment and context you’re doing it in.\nThis is life. Some games are fun to me. Others less fun by definition. But any game may be better than no game. Unless the game involves a high risk of me breaking my spine. Nuance.\nPoint is: it takes a long while to find what environments you thrive in. Any company can offer just one or potentially many environments depending on their size or the role.\nSo if you don’t know what you’re interested in, you must explore. You try.\n\n\nFinding the best environment\nFirst on the environment.\nJane Austen is better at this than me. Take all those sisters in Pride and Prejudice who have varying views on love and stability. Some sisters believe in true love. Others think it’s a myth and instead choose financial stability. Of course true love wins in the end.\nI suppose work is very similar: you’re going to get out of it what you believe is possible. After all: you work with and for people.\nIt will take time and risks to figure out what environments you thrive in, kind of like dating. The interview is part of the process. Bring in a company is another part. Talking to friends in other companies is a third part. Thinking grass is greener is a fourth part, and so forth. That’s life.\nYour needs also change in your career. As you change, your preferences change. It’s up to you to learn how to match your preferences with your environments, and how to accommodate your preferences within your environments.\nIf you don’t like your roommate, you can leave early or wait till your contract expires or etc etc. or you can try to work it out and get to know your roommate. All are options. Which you choose is up to you. In the end, a good environment takes two. But it also takes one to instigate change for the better for both. Reciprocity.\n\n\nExperiment Your Way to a Happy Career\nThen there’s the thing you’re doing.\nYou can “try” anything by doing it yourself. Do you want to be a teacher? Go try to volunteer teaching. Do you want to be a coder? Spend 20 hours trying to build an app. Do you want to be a doctor? Volunteer with doctors.\nFour ways of learning what you like emerge. The quality of the information is ordered top to bottom while the amount of time it takes to get that information is bottom to top:\n\nReading about an industry or job is kind of helpful.\nTalking to people in the field is more helpful.\nFollowing and shadowing those people is even more useful.\nBut actually doing the work is the only way to really know.\n\nYou can read about 50 jobs to see what piques your interest and help you learn what’s out there. Next, you can increase the chance of pursuing a job you like by trying to do it without actually having to get the job.\nYou can get a pretty good sense by doing little projects similar to what the real work is going to be.\n\n\nDon’t Not Try Something Because of a Dumb Reason\nA lot of people think they shouldn’t do something because they’re not good enough. Even professionals. (Tiger Woods just had his worst round of his life, but I’m guessing he’s still better than you.)\nOr they think they shouldn’t try something because they’re not yet credentialed. “Don’t try this at home kids”. It’s what we’re taught.\nAnd that’s kind of the great myth: the myth of titles and credentials. That you need to be experienced at something to be able to do that thing. But that’s a lie. Instead, you should only pursue the credential if it offers you something you can’t otherwise get (due to red tape). And until you get the credential, you’re just spending a few hours every day learning stuff and maybe passing an exam at the end. So if you ignore the exam, what’s stopping you from just picking up the activities today you may find rewarding?\nI once spent a single week shadowing dentists in an open room in Honduras. I was a Spanish translator for these American dentists that came through. I felt pretty confident by the end that I could probably do one of the fillings just because it really wasn’t that complicated. And the dentists told me so. Once you look at 100 cavities in a mouth it’s not hard to spot them. This was the easiest way to de-myth this job: watching and observing.\n\nIt was actually really boring. Once you’ve seen 100 cavities you’ve seen them all I think. Glad I figured that out quickly! But I know there’s someone out there that disagrees with me and I’m glad they’ll be drilling my teeth and not me.\n\n90% of most people’s jobs could be taught via apprenticeship, like the good old days. Today’s world of credentials makes people think they’re incapable of doing a pretty simple task: putting a tool into someone’s tooth. But before you invest 8 years of your life in dental school, why not go be a dental hygienist for 1 year? Instead of doing a coding bootcamp, why not just code in your basement for a month after hours? This is the way to find what you like.\nWhether you enjoy doing that thing that created value for people can only be discovered by doing it.\n\n\nPeople Hire you Because you offer a Service or Value. Period.\nYour real job is to create value for people. It’s not a title. It’s not a credential. It’s not mandated or necessary in society. And if you were born 100 years before today or 100 years after the job may not exist. So think about opportunities in this way.\nA healthier way to thinking about corporate life is: what creates value? Is there a reasonable exchange of goods for my offering?\nI’m capable of many offerings. But they’re hiring for one offering. That’s life.\nIf I were selling apricots, and someone was offering me peanuts, would I exchange my apricots for their peanuts? Well, if we were the only two people sure.\nBut maybe I feel like I can get some avocados for my apricots. So can I find an avocado dealer? Do they even like apricots? Do they already have enough apricots? And if yes to all the above, are they even in the mood to exchange for apricots today? Lastly, do they like me?\n\n\n\nWork is just an exchange of goods\n\n\nGetting a job is more of a negotiation than anything. And everything in work is a negotiation. Read Never Split the Difference and that becomes quite apparent. Work is nothing fancy. It’s not a title. It’s not a degree. It’s just doing little activities.\nAnd after you’ve 1000 similar activities you’re soon labeled a data scientist or a farmer. And if you circled the right boxes on an exam and got a piece of paper you’re now a doctor/dentist. But the paper or the title don’t make you good at that thing. My point: create value, not titles.\n\n\nIn Sum\nSo yes. I’ve gone on a rant here. But hey this is my blog. I’m trying to talk about the deeper issues at how to choose a profession or a company within that profession. I’m trying to break away from the titles and credentials that blind our thinking away from the more important questions of “what activities bring me joy” and “how will I know it?” And “will someone pay me for doing this activity?” And “how do I find an environment of people that will enable me to do valuable activities and make it a pleasant place to work?” (PS, some say to not work for Elon Musk…unless you enjoy his working style.)\nLong story short: make sure the company hiring you actually needs your skills to run their business. Strive to find better opportunities by putting yourself out there and trying new things. And find people you like working with. All the rest is just a bonus.\nThe most dangerous thing is to get all those good things on your first job because then you try to self actualize per Maslov’s hierarchy of needs. “Don’t it always seem to go That you don’t know what you got ’til it’s gone?” (Lyrics) So if you get a “bad” job just know it’s part of the process and one day 10 years from now you’ll probably be grateful you had that job anyway.\nIf I didn’t actually answer your questions that’s because some questions are a perennial debate. Some popular people hate the idea of work-life balance, some embrace it. Go figure. And keep searching to find someone who sees work and career the same way you do, because there are millions of jobs in the work. Hundreds of millions.\n\n\nBooks to read\nIt helps to get perspective when choosing where you want to work.\n\nHow to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices - have a decision framework\nThe 6 Types of Working Genius - understand who you are.\nOvercoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team - it helps to recognize a good company by first understanding a bad company.\nThe Old Man and the Sea - a job is a job at the end of the day. It’s just fishing.\n\n\n\nPractical Questions\nThings I’d think about in your shoes:\n\nwhat loosely sounds interesting? Who perhaps knows someone with that type of role? How do I get 15 min with that person, or a quick email? (Use 6 degrees of separation to your advantage)\ndo I have an ideal salary? What’s realistic? (Levels.fyi, don’t over or undersell yourself. Figure out market rates and if your job will support your desired lifestyle in a location)\nwhat’s the entry level job that gets me some experience 50% in the right direction that I’m interested in?\nwhere will I learn?\nDoes this company offer flexibility to try new things?\n\nSometimes job searching is helped by thinking by contrast:\n\nwhat can someone not pay me $500k per year to do? $300k? $100k? (Nobody could pay me $500k to be an investment banker and work 100 hour weeks. Maybe they could pay me $2M and I’d do it for 2 years ya know? But $500 isn’t enough.)\n\nAs you’re interviewing:\n\nwhat incentivizes people on a daily basis?\nwill this job be around in 2 years? Why? Why not? Why might they fire me in 6 months for things 100% outside of my control? (Recessions, business strategy shifts, etc)\nhow essential is my skillset to what they do?\nwhat relationship do people have with my would-be manager?\n\nQuestions to potentially ask your hiring manager:\n\nHow do you see me fitting into this role?\nWhy might this role not be a good fit for me?\nWho’s the highest ranking person who’s quit or been fired recently and why?\nHow do you define success for this role?\n\nQuestions to ask your peers you’re interviewing with:\n\ndescribe your relationship with your manager?\ndescribe the communication patterns of the team?\ndescribe how decisions are made? What’s a recent decision that was made? describe your role in how the team made that decision?\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nWriting a Tech Resume\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I have 3000 notes in one app, 2200 notes in another, at least 1800 digital journal entries over 10 years, I’ve built and replaced probably 5 blogs. This blog has 57 entries so far. What have I learned?\n\nMake writing daily as easy as possible. I set up some automation so I can write from my phone for daily blogging.\nWriting makes things feel real for me. It helps connect the dots. It’s a far more productive way to read the news. Less stuff, more thinking. Because if I can’t write at least one useful note about something I read, I realize it wasn’t worth reading.\nPerhaps reading is the more important daily duty. Well, to write I need something to inspire me. Usually that comes from the news. Sometimes inspiration comes from yesterday’s post. This inspiration came from editing my prior post.\n\nI’m not gonna worry about who reads this. But instead focus on writing every day because…\n\nI think it helps me practice storytelling\nhelps me practice communication\n\nHamilton wrote like he was “running out of time”.

    "text": "TL;DR: Be the hen. Do work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Little Red Hen” is a classic folk tale that tells the story of a hardworking red hen who finds wheat seeds and decides to plant them. Throughout the story, she asks other farm animals for help with various tasks—planting the wheat, harvesting it, milling the flour, and baking the bread. Each time, the animals refuse to help. However, once the bread is baked and the hen asks who will help her eat it, all the animals eagerly volunteer. She declines their offers, choosing to eat the bread with her chicks, who assisted her in the work.\nSo, too, do startups everywhere struggle to get funding. 100 rejections, etc.\nAnd great products don’t get attention until there’s social proof. Many e-commerce companies understand this - sales take off as more people buy, which gets more reviews, which gets more trust - even if the product didn’t change much between first sale to the last.\nThe only difference between startups and the red hen is she perhaps had a recipe. She didn’t have to wonder, “is baking bread possible? Will the recipe be delicious?”\nIt takes a founder’s belief to see what isn’t yet so and build it anyway. Be the founder. Be the hen. Dream big. Go bake some bread even if nobody’s watching.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Hemingway introduced through his writing style the Iceberg Theory. It was something I noticed while reading The Old Man and the Sea. You feel the depth of emotion from the “actions and dialogue”, rather than explicit descriptions.\nIt’s fun to contrast that with Frank Herbert’s style which is “lay out the environment, have dialogue, then draw conclusions in the mind”.\nBoth styles speak to the thought that the writing is more interesting the less you write about. They call this “negative space” in drawing. A sketch is interesting when the mind can fill in the gaps. As an artist, you just want to make enough dots that they can connect them themselves. This connecting process is the freedom and interest the mind craves. It doesn’t want to be coddled (The Coddling of the American Mind).\nBack to the book. The Old Man and the Sea can be summarized in one sentence: a tired, old, and recently-unlucky man catches the biggest of his life and it gets eaten before he makes it home.\nThat’s the surface story, and it’s rather boring when thought of that way. But you just feel so much while reading it. You feel for the old man through the young boy. You feel for him as he teeters between passing out and existing. You remember the breaking points in your own life and want the man desperately to succeed. Luck, however, was not on his side.\n“Talk less. Smile more.” - Hamilton\n\n\n\nLet their mind wander\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Is there any merit in that argument?\nConsider again what happens and reevaluate without the cognitive distortions.\nWrite down your new feelings.\nWrite again the weight of your thoughts.\n\nAll 17 distortions from Appendix 1: How to Do CBT | coddling\nCategories of Distorted Automatic Thoughts\n\nMIND READING: You assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinksI’m a loser.”\nFORTUNE- TELLING: You predict the future negatively: Things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “I’ll fail that exam,” or “I won’t get the job.”\nCATASTROPHIZING: You believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand it. “It would be terrible if I failed.”\nLABELING: You assign global negative traits to yourself and others.“I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”\nDISCOUNTING POSITIVES: You claim that the positive things you or others do are trivial. “That’s what wives are supposed to do— so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”\nNEGATIVE FILTERING: You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.”\nOVERGENERALIZING: You perceive a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”\nDICHOTOMOUS THINKING: You view events or people in all‑or ‑ ‑nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”\nSHOULDS: You interpret events in terms of how things should be, rather than simply focusing on what is. “I should do well. If I don’t, then I’m a failure.”\nPERSONALIZING: You attribute a disproportionate amount of the blame to yourself for negative events, and you fail to see that certain events are also caused by others. “The marriage ended because I failed.” \nBLAMING: You focus on the other person as the source of your negative feelings, and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all my problems.”\nUNFAIR COMPARISONS: You interpret events in terms of standards that are unrealistic— for example, you focus primarily on others who do better than you and find yourself inferior in the comparison. “She’s more successful than I am,” or “Others did better than Idid on the test.”\nREGRET ORIENTATION: You focus on the idea that you could have done better in the past, rather than on what you can do better now.“I could have had a better job if I had tried,” or “I shouldn’t have said that.”\nWHAT IF?: You keep asking a series of questions about “what if”something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “Yeah, but what if I get anxious?” or “What if I can’t catch my breath?”\nEMOTIONAL REASONING: You let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”\nINABILITY TO DISCONFIRM: You reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. For example, when you have the thought “I’m unlovable,” you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. Consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “That’s not the real issue. There are deeper problems.There are other factors.”\nJUDGMENT FOCUS: You view yourself, others, and events in terms of evaluations as good– bad or superior– inferior, rather than simply describing, accepting, or understanding. You are continually measuring yourself and others according to arbitrary standards, and finding that you and others fall short. You are focused on the judgments of others as well as your own judgments of yourself. “I didn’t perform well in college,” or “If I take up tennis, I won’t do well,” or“Look how successful she is. I’m not successful.”\n\n​\n2024-03-12\n\nI feel this could have been written today.\nSafetyism. Words are harmful.\nScreens &gt; 2 hours a day increase risk of suicide.\nKids are being coddled. Over worked. Over engineered for top tier schools. But who says those schools produce successful people? What’s the goal of getting into a top tier university? Will you really be better off in life? Most of the kids aren’t able to handle life and enjoy it.\nCollege has become a country club. Pay $100k/year.\nKids\nEssentially, his theory is that universities are getting more fragile kids who are playing less, on social media more. They pursue safetyism. They give up liberties such as\nLet your kid walk where is safe for them to do so. Avoid overprotection.\n\nPrepare kids.\nFree from adult guidance.\nProductive disagreement. Teach kids to argue productively.\n\n“Talk with strangers, just never go off with them”\nKids today at 18 have the maturity of 15 year olds 20 years ago. Too much time on phones. Too much time afraid, even though substantively less crime.\nMindfulness:\n\nAdam grant on good conflict:\n\nFrame it as a debate rather than a conflict\nArgue as if you’re right but listen as if you’re wrong and be willing to change your mind\nGive the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective\nAcknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you’ve learned from them.\n\nYour own thoughts unguarded.\nwSJ on lazy river - 207k/4 years.

We can overcome by paying heed. But the people who probably need to read this book don’t. Same with any book: it’s never received by the people who need it most, perhaps.\nanti-fragility: don’t want you to be safe. Want you to be strong. Armor. Don’t want you to run. Want you to have the strength to overcome.\nconcept creep.\nDon’t defend the attacked.\n“rallies are sometimes in the belief in a God, but always in the belief of a devil”\n\n\n\n2024-01-23\nCBT: Emotional Reasoning, catastrophizing, labeling, Overgeneralising, black|white, mind reading, negative filtering, discounting positives, blaming\n\nEmotional reasoning. Confusing feelings with thoughts or reality is a cognitive distortion.\nCatastrophizing imagines a sequence of events. But it’s seldom true.\nOvergeneralising.\nDichotomous thinking. All or nothing thinking.\nMind reading\nLabelling. Because someone belongs to a category doesn’t mean they embody all the traits of that category.\nNegative filtering. Amplifying negative signals, so it overwhelms the positive.\nDiscounting positives. Rationalising away positive evidence as if it doesn’t count.\nBlaming.\n\n\ntribalism.\nCARE framework for responding to challenges.\nTheory: we grow through being challenged, not the opposite. We are not our feelings.\nPrinciple of charity: assume the best intent (not the worst)\nprepare the kid for the road, not the road for the kid.

What are the key takeaways for me? - substitution biases - What you see is all there is and all - The ways it biases - Californians aren’t actually happier because they don’t think about what they have.\n\n“The acquisition of skills requires a regular environment, an adequate opportunity to practice, and rapid and unequivocal feedback about the correctness of thoughts and actions. When these conditions are fulfilled, skill eventually develops, and the intuitive judgments and choices that quickly come to mind will mostly be accurate. All this is the work of System 1, which means it occurs automatically and fast.”\n\n2024-04-27\nConclusion\n\nAnchoring evfects\nNarrow framing\nExcessive coherence\nJudge a decision by how it was made, not by how it turned out\n\nChapter , - remembering self vs experiencing self. We do not - We only remember the peak and the end. Not duration. - Happiness is a function of time you spend with people you love and who love you. - Ill health has a huge impact on happiness. - Religion doesn’t reduce depression. - Being poor makes someone miserable, but being rich has little positive impact on happiness. - Having an ambitious goal and not achieving it creates more dissatisfaction than not having a goal at all - Miswanting: misprojecting what you think will make you happy given your preferences will change and your tastes will adjust. - Focus illusion: what you think about isn’t as important as when you’re not thinking about it.\nChapter\n\n“preference reversal”. You’re likely to choose to exercise a safer bet. 11/36 chance to win 160 or 25/36 to lose 40. Or 25/36 to win $40 ot 1/36 to lose 10. You may choose to sell the bet and preference reverses. Owning vs exercises.\nCoherence doctrine\nsubstitution. We do substitution a lot in decisions. I like his chin. He’s therefore a strong leader. I’ll vote for him. Substituted looks for leadership qualities.\n\nSubstitution on sales. Do you want 100 burgers or $300? Save the dolphins? Hard to put a price in how much to save dolphins. You need to break it down\n\nSingle evaluation vs joint evaluation. We’re better at joint. Assessing damages in single evaluation is hard. But assessing two cases together is much easier. Legal system favors single evaluation of a case rather than relative evaluation which is much more fair.\n\nNeed joint evaluation in data science. Improves overall outcomes.\nWhen you look at a case individually you’re more likely to be system 1.\n\n\nFraming - keep vs lose. - France lost the game. Italy won. - Losses are not costs. → paying $5 for a lottery ticket vs paying $1 and losing $4 are very different. - 10% mortality rate vs 90% survival rate → people pick the positive. - People have a hard time making choices against the frame. If it’s framed as the wrong choice then they’re likely to do the “right” thing - gallons per mile or miles per gallon? Gallons per mile is a much better framing.\n\nFrame it as “how much money you keep” rather than lose\nif you lose tickets will you replace them? If you lose money will you still buy the tickets? → sunk cost fallacy. Mental accounting. Only what matters is where you are today.\n\nSunk cost anxiety: it takes longer than you think. Do you keep going? Depends on at that point how much time it’ll take.\n2024-04-26\n\nYou’re more likely to regret if you think not enough or more than just a litttle. Either think not at all or think it all the way through.\nPeople feel more regret with action than inaction. → someone selling a stock and they would have gotten $1200 vs someone who didn’t trade and would have gotten $1200\nMental accounts of sunk costs → why it’s better to swap out a bad CEO because the new one might not be better but they don’t have sunk cost fallacy.\nrare events are overweighted in the mind if they’ve been experienced.

The latter seems more probable.\nDenominator neglect: a disease that kills 1/100 people is more salient than 1.5%. →\nterrorism: associative availability bias compounded by media.

Golfers perceive putting for birdie as a foregone gain, but putting for par as something they cannot lose. So for the same distance, you’re slightly more likely to sink the par than you are the birdie. https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Notes-This-figure-depicts-the-fraction-of-successful-par-and-birdie-putts-by-distance-to_fig2_229050997\n\nSome economists analyzed 2.5M putts between 2004-2009 on PGA tour.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary:\n\nabout 70% of an instructive story and 30% the true content. The story is really cringe/cheesy but helps introduce the ideas.\nBack 30% presents the concrete definitions. It lays out how a team can truly work together as a team to complement each other’s strengths.\n\n2024-03-11\nThe 6 Types of Working Genius: Book Overview | Shortform Books\nWe all have things that either energize or drain us. If we’re aware, we can complement each other.\nThree phases of work/a task: ideation, activation, and implementation. Each task requires two types of genius.\n\nIdeation\n\nWonder: Ask why? Ask “is there a better way?”\nInnovation: figure out solutions.\n\nActivation\n\nDiscernment: use intuition and judgment in figuring out good/bad ideas\nGalvanize/rally people/buy-in\n\nimplementation\n\nEnable: volunteer. Help people. Empower.\nTenacity: cross the finish line. Execute. Pound obstacles.\n\n\nSix type of genius more concretely defined:\n\nWonder: Involved the ability to ponder, speculate, and question the state of things. Asking the questions that provoke answer and action. People with this genius are naturally inclined to do these things, to lose themselves in observing the world around them and wondering if things shouldn’t be different or untapped potential that should be tapped.\nInnovation: come up with new ideas or solutions. They’re drawn to origination, creativity and ingenuity, even with little context or directions. Though every type is a genius, these are the people who are most often referred to as geniuses because many of their ideas seem to come out of thin air.\nDiscernment: related to sanctity, intuition, and uncanny judgment. People with this genius have the natural ability to assess an idea or situation even without a lot of data or expertises. Using pattern recognition and gut feel they’re able to provide valuable advice and feedback around most subjects in a way that transcends their levels of specific knowledge or information.\nGalvanizing: is about rallying, motivating, or provoking people to take action around an idea or an initiative. People with this genius are naturally inclined to inspire or enlist people to get involved in an endeavor. They don’t mind persuading people to rethink or change their plans to embark on something worthwhile.\nEnabling: providing people with support and assistance in a way that it is needed. People with this genius are adept at responding to the needs of others without conditions or restrictions. They’re naturally inclined to help others accomplish their goals and can often anticipate what people might need before they ask. Individuals with this genius are frequently unaware that this is a genius at all.\nTenacity: is about the satisfaction of pushing things across the finish line to completion. They’re not only capable of and naturally inclined to finish projects to ensure they’re completed to specification. They gain energy by pushing through obstacles and seeing the impact of their work and they find joy from crossing tasks off their list and getting closure.\n\nCategories of genius - each person has two geniuses, two competencies, and two frustrations. (Per their research)\n\nGenius: it energizes you. Joy, energy, and passion.\nCompetency: it neither energizes nor drains you. Can do fairly well. But we will eventually grow weary if we can do our geniuses.\nFrustration: it drains you. Struggle. Hate it. You can spent a ton of time here without getting to burnout, or failure.\n\nGenius activation modes: you’ll probably have two responsive and two disruptive geniuses.\n\nResponsive: respond to an external stimulus to be put into action. Need to be activated by an event.\nDisruptive: initiate or provoke change when they see a need for it. More proactive.\n\n\n\n\nBook cover\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Deciding Vision: As I write this, choosing a project might be a good place to insert a goal (intended outcome) as a project name. Instead of Exercise, the intended outcome is improving health. The goal is being able to run a 5k. So perhaps goal/objective is “ImproveHealth” and KR is “run 5k”. These goals can be identified by asking the 5 whys. If I have an idea if “go running” as my task, a good grounds-up vision exercise would be to ask “why do I want to run a mile tomorrow? Is it to accomplish something or to relax my mind? Why is relaxing my mind important to me? Why is my mental health important? Etc. I think subconsciously ideas come of what to do next all the time “I should work out” but rarely do I take the time to ask “why do I see the need to work out? What’s the greater vision here for this task?” Understanding that vision can help prioritize and build a desire to accomplish the task. If the idea “learn a new language” comes up, asking why can help me realize “oh, this is just for fun and won’t be for anything meatier than having fun! No pressure on this task and maybe I’ll never do it.” The nag to run a mile might help me realize “I need to take care of my health, and this can’t wait.”↩︎"

    "text": "Thoughts:\n\nI felt like most of the book was hard to follow. All the flowery detail had themes in it I wanted to take something from but decided it wasn’t worth rewinding for. So I stuck high level to the dialogue.\nThe most powerful moment was the father saying “you’re not the one who has to worry about everything” and the boy replies, “yes I am”. He’s the one that has to worry because he’s going to survive while his dad dies.\nHis dad said he’d join his son in death, but didn’t tell his son to join him.\nThe father was a good scavenger, but there was a group following them the whole time and he never noticed.\nsurvival is about movement. I think in many ways we’re all choosing to move somewhere. Gotta keep moving, or else you die. Even in a world filled with death, movement is life.\n\n\n2024-05-07\n\nyou’re not the one who has to worry about everything. → yes, I am. I am the one. → they hold the fire.\nTheme: the conscience of a child. He saved his dad from becoming like the rest: savages.\n\nA scared child offers to help.\nA scared adult fights to survive.\n\nChild avoids going places that makes him scared.\n\n2024-05-06\n\nthere’s no certainty about anything expect death: “there’s no fathers and no book.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Tim Ferris describes why he doesn’t have social media on his phone:\n\nI recently deleted social media from my phone 14 days ago. I had been using Instagram until April when I quit and migrated to Twitter the rest of the year. I recently realized within days how much better I felt without social media. Happier. Legitimately happier.\nAnd why? What did I get out of it? I wasn’t growing closer to friends. That’s what texting and calling and spending time in person does. But I’d argue even texting doesn’t really strengthen a relationship because it’s so hard to properly interpret emotions and cues via text: you interpret them how you read those texts. You interpret it according to your emotional state, not the sender’s.\nPhone provides vocal emotional cues. Body language another set of emotional cues. I can get probably 70% of this out from FaceTime or Zoom. But being in person is what we’re meant for.\nThis is why we strengthen relationships locally, and fail to continue ones from high school or our previous job.\nSo what was I doing on social media? Watching clips of either strangers I don’t care about or college associates I friended (once lived locally with) that I no longer talk to.\nSo what’s the knife you’re bringing to the gun fight? When at YouTube I heard the CEO praise a team for increasing “seconds watched” by 15% by reducing the lag of the swipes between YouTube shorts (TikTok clone). The lag reduction was in the milliseconds. Meaning: they made the slot machine more addictive.\nYour attention is being bought and manipulated by the shareholders of these companies.\n\n\n\nYes, they’re targeting specifically you. You don’t stand a chance. And you have a pocket knife, and you’re 50 feet away. Who’s gonna win?\n\n\nThey A/B test everything. This isn’t morally wrong. It’s actually quite human: we all A/B test everything every day. A joke here. A smile there. We put out feelers and see if we get a reaction. Don’t believe me? Ask my kid why he keeps throwing things in the toilet!\nBillions of dollars and the brightest minds on earth are working at FAANG. Why? They need to provide for their families and academics doesn’t pay. Non-profits don’t pay. This isn’t immoral, it just is. There are very good people working there: honest, moral people. Some of the best I’ve seen in the industry. But when you get paid to maximize swipes, you maximize swipes. It’s just human nature. And some of them buy into the odd notions of “snackable content”, as if swiping for 30 minutes while on the toilet is what anyone wakes up excited to do. Keep on snacking…\nSocial media and Netflix provide a ton of value to the world in my opinion. I can use them to call anyone I want, raise money for a cause, or get likes on a cute pic of my cat (I don’t have a cat). I do see the value.\nBut the costs for me have outweighed the value.\nI do miss laughing about some random Reel. There’s nothing that can get you laughing faster than a 10 second clip paired with the right cuts and music and everything. The right meme just nails it in a way nothing else can. I miss seeing memes from my friends. But when all I do is send memes to these friends, is that a friendship?\nSince being off social media I feel like my senses have grown. I now find my kids a lot funnier, my wife funnier, and I’m able to make heavy situations lighter much easier.\nThere’s a quote in Dune that’s something like “If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken”. I’d argue my other relationships had weakened too. Time to leave the fight. I was losing.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "I see a lot of executives dive into AI with a fury of excitement - the possibilities are endless. As it results, chatbots offering used cars for $1, refund policies you don’t want to stand behind and having the system generate fake legal briefs (Air Canada’s failed AI-generated Refund Policy and other AI mishaps: When you need guardrails on your AI).\nI see this with experienced executives saying “I want to just infuse my product with AI.” For example, “I’ve got 100 PDFs and a wealth of knowledge that I want to integrate into my app”.\nImagine you’re an unknown artist. What’s more likely for success: pain something you want, or paint something by commission?\n\n\n\nHow much time will it take to build an AI apple picker vs just hiring someone?\n\n\nSoftware fails when software developers build something because it sounds like a good idea. Essentially, they build a solution looking for a problem. Or they believe “if I build this my customers will love it.”\nThe same goes for AI. We’re at a new wave where anything is possible. Perhaps you’re so entrenched in a problem you intuitively know the solution, build something, and your customers (or coworkers) love what you’ve made.\nFar more likely is you end up believing AI isn’t working.\nHere are the five questions you should ask before adopting AI:\n\nWhats the job my customer will hire my AI to do? (Know Your Customers’ “Jobs to Be Done”)\nWhy will they hire my AI?\nHow much is not having my AI costing them?\nIf my AI didn’t exists, whats the stupidest way my customers could get an 80% solution?\nIf my AI does exist in all its glory, why will it fail miserably to do the job its hired to do?\n\nToo many dive straight to a solution.\nYes, AI is and will revolutionize jobs. The first ones it’ll revolutionize are the obvious ones: the boring or time intensive tasks that you’re already doing. For Hollywood, AI will replace the laborious task of generating storyboards and such (Unreal AI: Meet Sora). They’re not trying to solve world hunger (first) at open AI. They’re trying to replace jons that are already being hired for. They want to replace truck drivers with AI drivers, warriors with AI drones, and creatives (artistic, musical, and software) with AI. They invented a whole new way of doing…the thing that needed to be done anyway.\nDon’t solve a problem that nobody cares about. Because at this point in the economy your customer already has Google, competitors they can go to, and half baked solutions they can already muster on their own. What they need from you is a solution to their biggest problem, now.\nMaybe AI will solve that. Maybe some basic software will instead. Ask yourself these three questions:\n\nWill this save time?\nSave energy?\nSave money?\n\nIf not, it’s not worth your time, energy, or money to develop.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been overdosing slightly on learning lately.\nEver since I got off social media, I got into writing (A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media), and listening to audio books.\nPodcasts are fine, but they’re about as quality as top-of-mind thinking. Books are usually far more instructive because each sentence is reviewed at least a few times if not a hundred times during the editing process.\nI noticed that once I started binging books instead of posts, my happiness and satisfaction increased.\nHere’s a strategy I’m using for learning.\n\nGet Audible and Spotify subscriptions. It has books that aren’t available on Libby (which I also use).\nStock up on free books using Libby. Hold times vary, but can be a few weeks or months for popular titles. Note: you can supply multiple library accounts.\nFor short books not on Libby, check Audible free catalog. If it’s not in the Audible free catalog, check Spotify Premium listening, which is 15 hours per month. If you listen to short books on Spotify, you can get 2-3 books in 15 hours. (It’s 15 book hours, not listening hours.) Also, if your phone is locked, you can go beyond the 15 hours (don’t report this…). But once you re open the app the 15 hour limit will halt you. 2-3 books would otherwise be $20-45 dollars depending on the cost of the audio book. $12 for Spotify premium is a deal.\nUse Audible credits for books you can’t find on Libby or Spotify. Remember, Audible is $15 per month. So don’t waste it on a $4 book.

    "text": "First seen on: Ethan Mollick on LinkedIn: I think that Google may have come out of nowhere to have the best LLM… | 19 comments\nImageFX Is the tool to generate images with Google’s Gemini. I’ve been a huge fan of using ChatGPT on iOS to get images for this blog. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually good or not. But it’s helped me associate a post with an idea (image), which I think is incredibly helpful for memory retention. So my theory has been: some content is better than no content. The other thought is: better learn now what these tools are and how to use them because you never know where you’re going to be able to take them. They’re like learning how to drive a car: if you can drive, you can go places.\nSo how does ImageFX compare?\n\nBattle Prompt\n\na battle of chatgpt vs Google Gemini photo generators. Psychedelic. Parasitic. Enlightened. Groovy. Ethereal. Down to earth.\n\nGoogle:\n\nAnd ChatGPT:\n\n\n\nChatGPt wins\n\n\nThis is but one test, and clearly chatGPT wins.\n\n\nFast Car Prompt\n\nImage: sports car driving along the highway. Scenic. Photographic. Realistic. Focused camera, low aperture. Beach off in the distance. Windy roads.\n\nGoogle:\n\n\n\nGemini\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nSports Car\n\n\nInterestingly, ChatGPT added a camera and had the identical photo inside the camera’s viewport. I’m really not sure how LLMs are that capable, that’s some diffusion inside diffusion.\nBut winner goes to Gemini here! That nails the image best.\nAlso, Gemini has an editor that pops up that lets you swap out backgrounds or objects. Pretty neat!\n\n\n\nPhoto editor\n\n\n\n\nHuman\nLet’s see how they do on people.\n\nImage: a seven year old brother and nine year old sister. The boy has brown hair, spiked. The girl has long curly blond hair. They’re on a swing-set together. The boy is jumping off the swing while the girl is on the swing but getting ready to. A creek and a grassy hill in the background.\n\nGoogle:\n\n\n\nAgainst Google policies\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nTwo kids Swinging\n\n\nChatGPT wins by TKO on this one. Gemini perhaps can’t generate images of kids? Not sure.\n\n\nFinal Battle: Picturesque Landscape\nNothing better than a sunset, right?\n\nSunset over the San Francisco Bay. Taken from the East, the Golden Gate Bridge is in visible. The sunset is bursting through a gentle fog, angle is taken from higher in the air, perhaps 1000 feet as if from a low helicopter view.\n\nGoogle:\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nSF sunset\n\n\nAnd a real photo taken from Google Images:\n\n\n\nWhat the sunset really looks like\n\n\nWinner here is Google Images search! Both of those photos are bad. ChatGPT nailed the fog, which Gemini omitted. Gemini is much closer to the mark but made up a city to the right. Both of them couldn’t produce the right angle for the sun. But hey, they’re both better than nothing!\n\n\nConclusion\nGemini is here! I can now use it to create images from my phone.\nAs a consumer, I think the mobile experience of ChatGPT is really great. But if I’m on desktop I may use Gemini because it gives me four variations for each prompt. And it’s free. Can’t beat free.\nBut ChatGPT can do crazy things that Gemini can’t, such as the head to head battle.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "Ibis DataFrames for Python, why I hate Pandas, and what I miss about dplyr",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I haven’t used ibis as of writing this. Just reviewed the docs.\n\n\nData Manipulation in Python\nI’ve been a Python data scientist for 5-6 years. I’ve never liked pandas. Ever.\nIt’s because I started as a tidyverse data scientist in R. One of the things I’ve missed about using Python is dplyr, an R package for data manipulation. And when I started with Python it was in PySpark - it felt very similar to dplyr, except for the annoying JVM.\nIt’s amazing because everything is done by chaining, and it’s able to manipulate in memory or translate to a spark or SQL backend for execution. (It’s very easy to use base dplyr and then just run the same query in memory on a small dataframe or against BigQuery or something.)\nThis chaining also avoids the common readability problem with pandas wherein often you see df[x] = df[y] / df[b] on one line and that’s repeated for multiple lines if you want to create multiple new variables.\nWhile pandas has the .pipe and .assign operators for chaining, they still require lambda functions, which get annoying. This Reddit thread explores the opinion I share: the api is inconsistent. Reddit - Does anyone else hate pandas?.\nPolars makes this much cleaner with the with_columns operator, for example, which is also very similar to PySpark. But polars is Rust backend, not Java. Game, Set, Match polars.\nI’m not the only one who loves dplyr . There have been several Python attempts to build dplyr in the Python ecosystem. There were great packages like GitHub - coursera/pandas-ply: functional data manipulation for pandas (9 years since last commit), and GitHub - dodger487/dplython: dplyr for python, not updated in 7 years. Then there’s the dfply package that hasn’t been maintained in 5 years (see tutorial).\nThe siuba package is the latest Python dplyr incantation that is actively maintained: GitHub - machow/siuba: Python library for using dplyr like syntax with pandas and SQL and can also execute against a SQL backend, but it can’t execute a polars backend. # Ibis to solve my problems?\nI just came across ibis however, and it seems really promising. Turns out it was created in 2015 by Wes McKinney, who created the pandas pyarrow backend to solve the “10 Things I Hate About pandas”. More on the\n\nIbis\nIbis – getting_started\nIbis – Analysis of World of Warcraft data\n\n\nIt looks like dplyr (for example it even copies some syntax like mutate() for adding new columns and select for picking columns). But, the benefit is it has polars and pandas as backends, but also offers PySpark (should someon need to use databricks as a backend compute engine). And it can also translate into SQL. Sure, polars can do this too: Databases - Polars user guide. But ibis seems more extensive.\nThis means I could have one programming language to execute either polars, SQL, or PySpark, rather than have both polars and SQL or pandas in my pipeline in different places. (Side note: why would I use pandas as a backend though when polars is so fast?)\nI just discovered this over the weekend. Would love your thoughts! I’m sure there are limitations vs raw polars/pandas that are hidden from my quick overview.\n\n\nAppendix\nThe most annoying thing about pandas is the .transform() operator. I hate it. Just hate it. It never makes sense and I always have to look it up. This essentially just does a window operation.\nYou don’t need this until you need to do some type of aggregation within a group. Let’s assume you want to calculate the fraction of sales attributed to a city within a state. (What fraction of sales in California come from San Francisco, for example.)\nRead the following and consider for yourself what’s simplest:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'State': ['CA', 'CA', 'CA', 'NY', 'NY', 'NY'],\n    'City': ['SF', 'LA', 'SF', 'NYC', 'Buffalo', 'NYC'],\n    'Sales': [100, 200, 150, 300, 100, 200]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state\ndf['Fraction'] = df.groupby('State')['Sales'].apply(lambda x: x / x.sum())\n\nprint(df)\nPolars:\nimport polars as pl\n\ndf = pl.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state\ndf = df.with_column(\n  pl.col('Sales') / df.groupby('State').agg(pl.sum('Sales'))['sum'])\n\nprint(df)\nDplyr:\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state\ndf &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(State) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Fraction = Sales / sum(Sales))\nIbis:\nimport ibis\n\n# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state\nexpr = sales.mutate(Fraction=sales['Sales'] / sales.groupby('State').Sales.sum())\n\nresult = expr.execute()\nprint(result)\nIt may not look all that different, but pandas has this weird syntax where you group by (something) but then select a column with brackets. But sometimes you can use periods to select the column.\nThe polars and ibis implementations seem simple, but overly verbose.\nThen there’s the dplyr. So elegant and simple. The sum() operator is summing within the group, and the sales/sum(sales) is very easy to read.\nIn pandas I’m left wondering what is x/x.sum() and why this lambda thing?\nThis is a very simple example, but the more you get into the weeds the more my point becomes obvious.\nThe benefits of dplyr come from when you want to do 10 mutates in one go. It’s so simple. In pandas that’s 10 lambda functions with a .assign operator.\nLike, look at pandas trying to do this:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'A': list(range(1, 11)),\n    'B': list(range(11, 21)),\n    'C': list(range(21, 31))\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Using assign to create 10 new columns\ndf = df.assign(\n    # New columns with various transformations\n    A_Squared=lambda x: x['A']**2,\n    B_Squared=lambda x: x['B']**2,\n    C_Squared=lambda x: x['C']**2,\n    A_Cubed=lambda x: x['A']**3,\n    B_Cubed=lambda x: x['B']**3,\n    C_Cubed=lambda x: x['C']**3,\n    A_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['A']),\n    B_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['B']),\n    C_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['C']),\n    A_B=lambda x: x['A'] * x['B']\n)\n\nprint(df)\nNow look at dplyr:\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Sample data\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  A = 1:10,\n  B = 11:20,\n  C = 21:30\n)\n\n# Using mutate to create 10 new columns\ndf &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # New columns with various transformations\n    A_Squared = A^2,\n    B_Squared = B^2,\n    C_Squared = C^2,\n    A_Cubed = A^3,\n    B_Cubed = B^3,\n    C_Cubed = C^3,\n    A_Log = log(A),\n    B_Log = log(B),\n    C_Log = log(C),\n    A_B = A * B\n  )\n\nprint(df)\nNow let’s complicate it, where each manipulation takes in a previous column:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})\n\n# Mutate operations\ndf['B'] = df['A'] ** 2\ndf['C'] = df['A'] + df['B'] * 2\ndf['D'] = df['B'] / 2\ndf['E'] = df['C'] - df['A']\ndf['F'] = df['A'] * 5\ndf['G'] = df['D'] - df['E']\ndf['H'] = df['F'] + df['G']\ndf['I'] = df['D'] ** 2\ndf['J'] = df['H'] / df['I']\ndf['K'] = df['I'] - df['J']\n\nprint(df)\nThis is how most people write pandas. They write df 26 times.\nLet’s look at pandas using the assign operator:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})\n\n# Mutate operations with assign and lambda functions\ndf = df.assign(\n    B=lambda x: x['A'] ** 2,\n    C=lambda x: x['A'] + x['B'] * 2,\n    D=lambda x: x['B'] / 2,\n    E=lambda x: x['C'] - x['A'],\n    F=lambda x: x['A'] * 5,\n    G=lambda x: x['D'] - x['E'],\n    H=lambda x: x['F'] + x['G'],\n    I=lambda x: x['D'] ** 2,\n    J=lambda x: x['H'] / x['I'],\n    K=lambda x: x['I'] - x['J']\n)\n\nprint(df)\nSlightly better but still an eyesore. 10 lambda statements and still 26 x calls.\nAnd in R:\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create a tibble\ndf &lt;- tibble(A = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))\n\n# Mutate operations\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(B = A ^ 2,\n         C = A + B * 2,\n         D = B / 2,\n         E = C - A,\n         F = A * 5,\n         G = D - E,\n         H = F + G,\n         I = D ^ 2,\n         J = H / I,\n         K = I - J)\n\nprint(df)\nIt’s just so simple. So elegant. So beautiful. No wasted text. Very easy to read.\nIbis seems similar to dplyr but requires the D = _.[\"B\"]/2 operation. Ibis – basics - mutating columns\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

What explains the difference?\nThere are two types of smart people. Those who make you feel smarter and those who remind you how smart they are.\nTruly brilliant people are focused on learning, and sharing, and helping those who were once like them: eager to learn.\nLess brilliant are those who are focused on themselves. Living in an insecure sand castle, they’re helplessly trying to reinforce as the waves of life crash on their egos.\nI’m not sure what makes one person the one or the other. It has nothing to do with their background, the titles they hold, the accomplishments they’ve achieved.\nPerhaps Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters explains it (paraphrasing): “war either makes you or breaks you. Either it makes you better or ruins your perception of life”.\nA favorite scripture of mind echos the sentiment:\n\nBut behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the war between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility.

To cross that threshold. It’s quite natural to want money. Nobody can truly say they don’t.\nBut imagine the day you hit 1,000,000 in your accounts.

Because the person you were before the millionth dollar will be the same person after the millionth dollar.\nAre you enjoying life today?

Second, how can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse and my family become an enduring source of happiness? Third, how can I be sure I’ll stay out of jail? Though the last question sounds lighthearted, it’s not. Two of the 32 people in my Rhodes scholar class spent time in jail. Jeff Skilling of Enron fame was a classmate of mine at HBS.

    "text": "Symbol\nWe break bread, but His bones were not broken. Only His flesh.\n\n\n\nBread to be broken\n\n\n\n\nScriptures\nWhenever we break the bread, I’m reminded of many things. But one that sticks out is that Christ’s legs were commanded to be broken by the Roman leaders:\n\nThe Jewish officials, who had not hesitated to slay their Lord, were horrified at the thought of men left hanging on crosses on such a day, for thereby the land would be defiled; so these scrupulous rulers went to Pilate and begged that Jesus and the two malefactors be summarily dispatched by the brutal Roman method of breaking their legs, the shock of which violent treatment had been found to be promptly fatal to the crucified. Jesus the Christ. Chapter 35. Death and Burial\n\nIt was a technique practiced by the Romans to hasten the death of the crucified:\n\nVictims in the head up position could spend several days on the cross before they died. One technique used by the Romans to hasten death was to break the legs below the knee with a blunt instrument1 (p. 25) Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion - PMC\n\nA bit graphic, but how did this technique possibly accelerate the death?\n\nAccording to those who have studied the grim mechanics of crucifixion, in order to breathe adequately, the crucified victim periodically had to push himself up using his legs. Breaking the legs prevented him from doing that, thus hastening his death. He would suffocate. Why are the crucified persons’ legs broken?\n\nBut Christ’s legs were not broken as instructed. Continuing the quote above from Jesus the Christ:\n\n…The governor gave his consent, and the soldiers broke the limbs of the two thieves with cudgels. Jesus, however, was found to be already dead, so they broke not His bones. Christ, the great Passover sacrifice, of whom all altar victims had been but suggestive prototypes, died through violence yet without a bone of His body being broken, as was a prescribed condition of the slain paschal lambs. Jesus the Christ. Chapter 35. Death and Burial\n\nWhy? Why weren’t the bones broken? Why is this significant?\nThe bones of a paschal lamb were meant not to be broken.\nIt dates back to the Mosiac Passover in Egypt (when the firstborns of the Egyptians and the Pharaoh were killed)\n\nIn one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. Exodus 12.46\n\n\nThey shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. Numbers 9.12\n\nIt was prophesied that “Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.” (Psalm 34.19–20)\nJohn testified of the fulfillment of this prophecy:\n\nThe Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: John 19.31–33\n\n\n36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. John 19.36\n\nSo while we break the bread, His bones were not broken. Just His flesh.\n\n\nMeaning\nThe details that were fulfilled at His death remind me of His prophetic life. The fact that he was killed according to the law, and the law predated him and is scripture in the Torah, is further evidence that Christ truly lived and that his life was a fulfillment of prophecy.\nLikewise, those same details apply to my life. He is involved in those details. Alma 37.7\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Symbol\nAll are welcome. Everyone. He doesn’t want a skimpy congregation. He wants it packed. The bread is offered to everyone, the way His life was.\nLikewise, his life was freely given. Free. He had control. And He gives the sacrament freely to all who see it.\n\n\nScriptures\nAll are invited to participate in the sacrament, which is symbolic of the life He freely gave. All souls in the chapel are invited to partake of His goodness.\nOnly He could give up His life:\n\nA natural effect of His immortal origin, as the earth-born Son of an immortal Sire, was that He was immune to death except as He surrendered thereto. The life of Jesus the Christ could not be taken save as He willed and allowed. The power to lay down His life was inherent in Himself, as was the power to take up His slain body in an immortalized state. Chapter 25. Jesus Again in Jerusalem\n\nChrist alone was given power by God to control the fate of his otherwise immortal body:\n\nTherefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. John 10.17–18\n\nBy similar rite, all are welcome. He is in control.\n\nAnd behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not; 3 Nephi 18.22\n\n\n\nMeaning\nBecause Christ had a choice, and not the Romans, over the timing of His death, and He chose to be taken in captivity, and He chose to walk up the hill, the Lord showed he did all that He could to offer Himself to us.\nWhen I pray, I’m not praying to an unknown God. I’m praying to one who fully understands me (Porous Bread).\nWhen I pray, I can remember He’s already done His part. The only thing holding me back from feeling His love is me.\nHow can I pray in such a way to lower those barriers that I put up between Him and me ?\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Symbol\nI thought of a funeral today while taking the sacrament. Everyone here is attending a funeral: in memory of our Savior.\nWe remember Him. We talk of Him. We celebrate His life.\nMost people show up to a funeral dressed in black. But he resurrected in white. And in the temple, we dress in white as He was resurrected.\n # Scriptures\n\nFor ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s. 1 Corinthians 6.20\n\n\nLift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and am your advocate with the Father; and it is his good will to give you the kingdom. Doctrine and Covenants 29.5\n\n\nListen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him— 4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified; 5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life. Doctrine and Covenants 45.3–5\n\n\n\nMeaning\nOne distinction between a funeral and a sacrament memorial service is that usually at a funeral you don’t focus on how they died. It’s too painful, especially if the death was unanticipated.\nBut at a sacrament meeting we take His bread, broken to symbolize the broken body. And we drink the water, to symbolize the blood that he shed in the garden, that he spilled on the cross under a crown of thorns and a litany of nails.\nWhy is this important? Because His life would have no value if He didn’t die for us. And he died for us. And how he died is relevant because it’s the price He paid for us. And knowing we’ve been bought with a price matters because it means we’re bound to him.\nRemembering His death and how He died reminds me that I want to live like He did.\nHe didn’t just die. How He died is everything. He died bleeding for us. He died with His last breath for us, instead of for Him. He didn’t just accept His place on the cross, He exchanged His physical life for our eternal lives. Barabbas was freed in exchange for Him, and we are Barabbas. We are the wicked sinners freed as He went guiltless to the execution. Can you imagine His disciples sitting in the chanting crowd and thinking: “you’re releasing the wrong man! One convicted for his crimes, the other convicted by those who hate their Messiah!” Yet they didn’t know that they’re as far from God in some ways as Barabbas is…\nAnd despite all the pain we put Him through, He is our Advocate.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I read a story once about the beet farmers by Jay Jensen. It was called “Hoe to the end of the row” (apparently there’s a poem with that same title).\n\n\n\nBeet it, just beet it…\n\n\nThe principle the author shared was of planting to the end of the row. Some people got lazy and gave up 80% of the way through. But the hard workers went to the end. They took pride in it. And when the harvest came the boss knew who was coming back next summer: those with finished rows.\nI’m grateful for hard work. My grandpa told my dad to work with his mind, not his back.\nSo my dad got a desk job. And so did I.\nPerhaps if my grandpa had seen today maybe he would instead say “get off those screens and go plant a beet”. But hard work is hard regardless of it being mental or physical. “Hard work” is the reward itself.\nIn another quote my father shared with me: “the gift of a good life is having lived it”. Same applies to hard work. The reward of hard work is having done it.\nMost of what we do on a daily basis goes unnoticed. The rewards are for ourselves.

The book discusses how toothpaste companies, particularly Pepsodent, leveraged the power of habit to increase their product’s usage. Duhigg explains how Pepsodent created a daily habit for people by associating the use of toothpaste with the tingling sensation it produces, which wasn’t common in toothpastes before Pepsodent. This case study is used to illustrate how cues and rewards can create lasting habits.\n\nPepsodent and their marketing team in the 1920’s changed life for us all. Same goes for body wash, hand soap, and other soaps - they put the bubbles in them to make us think it’s “working”.\nBut I also like bubbles. Who doesn’t like bubbles? Toothpaste has bubbles.

    "text": "I participated in Boy Scouts growing up, and I got to go to High Adventure. This was a week where we’d go on an adventurous camping trip with a bunch of other teenagers. Things never went according to plan.\nOn one experience, I was repelling over a hang. After 30 feet repelling, I was then dangling over nothing. There was a double belay, one above and one below. This meant that either could help save me.\nI was invited to let go of my first belay. Yes. Let go.\nThis meant I’d drop 150-200 feet in a free fall. The bottom belay would catch me.\nI held the rope tightly in my hand as I looked off into the Appalachian mountains and the green trees dotting my surroundings. I looked ahead at the rock face, and up at the cliff hang. I held that rope for a second more before…drop.\nAnd I fell, as planned! It was insane and it took all of half a second.\nBut then something unexpected happened: the first belay rope wrapped around my right leg. I turned upside down and instead of the belay stopping me, the burning of rope wrapped around my leg halted my descent. Didn’t feel good.\nI’m grateful I didn’t die that day. That rope could have wrapped my neck. It’s possible I could have not stopped for some reason. It’s possible those guys who were my guides that day didn’t actually know what they were doing and it wasn’t as safe as they said.\nThat feeling of dropping was incredible though, as you never feel so heavy as when your hurtling towards the ground at gravitational constant acceleration.\nI had many great experiences since then rock climbing, though I don’t go often. It’s just a cool thing to do. It’s cool people figured out how to do it and how to do it safely. I’m also grateful for high adventure - I learned a lot from those formative experiences.\n\n\n\nThis cartoon kinda gets it pretty much right. Excited. Let go. Terrified.

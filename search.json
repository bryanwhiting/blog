I read a story once about the beet farmers by Jay Jensen. It was called “Hoe to the end of the row” (apparently there’s a poem with that same title).\n\n\n\nBeet it, just beet it…\n\n\nThe principle the author shared was of planting to the end of the row. Some people got lazy and gave up 80% of the way through. But the hard workers went to the end. They took pride in it. And when the harvest came the boss knew who was coming back next summer: those with finished rows.\nI’m grateful for hard work. My grandpa told my dad to work with his mind, not his back.\nSo my dad got a desk job. And so did I.\nPerhaps if my grandpa had seen today maybe he would instead say “get off those screens and go plant a beet”. But hard work is hard regardless of it being mental or physical. “Hard work” is the reward itself.\nIn another quote my father shared with me: “the gift of a good life is having lived it”. Same applies to hard work. The reward of hard work is having done it.\nMost of what we do on a daily basis goes unnoticed. The rewards are for ourselves. This is a joy of life.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "A Church Culture of Missionary work",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A friend gave a talk in church about missionary work, which is the Lord’s invitation to share His gospel and good news with the world. Having been a missionary for two years, it’s much less about “effective sales” strategies and much more about trying to live like a good person and invite others to enjoy the benefits of following Christ.\nI bring up the point about sales because a lot of people outside of the church can see LDS missionaries as salespeople. To one degree, they are: they’re trying to change people’s belief system. Adopt Christianity. 1\nYea, that’s certainly a reasonable way to look at it from one angle. But the reality is more like “I have something that’s great and I want other people to benefit from it the same way I benefit from it”. Or better said: there’s so much…misinformation about my church and Christianity in general, how do I have a productive conversation with you about it without knowing where you are? I’d love to talk to you about it, but are you deeply inwardly vehemently against it for some obtuse reason I’m not aware of? That’s what provoked some fear in sharing His good news.\nBut these fears aren’t warranted. Because that isn’t the right focus from my end. The best focus for “missionary work” is: if I have something that’s great in my life, I should share it like anything else great in my life.\nDid I see a good movie over the weekend? Great, share it. Did i hear a great talk on Sunday at church? Great, share it. Did I have a good hike? Awesome, share it. Did I have a funny experience while teaching some kids on Sunday? Yea, dope. Share it.\n\n\n\nMind if I drink this? Oh, you’d like some? I didn’t want to offend you by offering but sure I’d love to share - Elder Uchtdorf analogy paraphrased\n\n\n\nThings I liked from my friends talk:\n\nOver the past several months, (my wife) and I have implemented a new fad into our lives in an attempt to improve our well-being, which is the practice of cold plunging. Some of you may have heard of this trend as many gurus talk about it on social media because of its benefits, such as reducing stress and mood enhancement. Cold plunging is submerging your body in very cold water (typically around 50 degrees) for a period of 3 to 6 minutes. Sounds absolutely terrible, right? Well, it is terrible! No matter how many times we do it, it is still very hard and very uncomfortable. Nonetheless, we continue to do it, almost every day, because of the way it makes us feel afterwards. Immediately after getting out of the water I feel alert, energized and confident I can tackle the tasks of the day. Sitting in that cold water is always uncomfortable, but the discomfort is always worth it. By having felt what’s on the other side, I can get comfortable with the uncomfortable.\n\nThis cold plunge analogy is interesting: because it’s always hard. Always intimidating. I think that’s true in my personal experience. But for me it’s more like… the opposite of hyperextending my knee.\nWhen I was in high school I got a knee injury. I hyperextended it. The first time was incredibly painful. I was out a few days. But then I came back and was fine-ish. Then a few weeks later I did it again. Then a few days later: again. By the end of the season, I was hyperextending it every other day. It was bad news. A few weeks after the season ended I was playing in a bball tournament and again big hyperextending.\nI stopped playing sports that summer and let myself heal up. Haven’t had problems since.\nSame with sharing the gospel, but the opposite. At first it’s really intimidating. You do it once and you realize it’s not that bad. Then the more you do it the more it becomes part of your day.\nKinda like writing in this blog. At first I’m trying to find my voice. Now I don’t care and just want to write. I hope it’s beneficial for you.\n\n\nOn the other hand, some may be thinking none of those sound any easier and maybe you sometimes feel that you aren’t contributing because missionary work is generally intimidating and uncomfortable to you. That is OKAY. All efforts, no matter how small, are important and impactful.\n\nThis reminded me of President Russel M. Nelson’s invitation:\n\nAnytime you do anything that helps anyone—on either side of the veil﻿—take a step toward making covenants with God and receiving their essential baptismal and temple ordinances, you are helping to gather Israel. It is as simple as that. Hope of Israel\n\n\n\nAs a missionary in (Some Area) I had one mission president for my first year and another for my second year. Both presidents elevated the success of the mission with different approaches and leadership styles. In my first year under my first mission president, the mission accomplished a big goal of doubling the number of baptisms from the previous year. During this time our mission president wasn’t fond of us spending too much time with members and our success came from focusing on other areas of the work. By contrast, my second mission president changed the culture and encouraged us to spend as much time with the members as we could, even if we did not have someone to teach with the members. He taught us to focus on the number of lessons with a member participating as the most important key indicator. As a result, the mission’s baptisms started to skyrocket and the number more than doubled again. I know that our success can be attributed to us striving to have as many members as possible participating in our lessons and our emphasis on members and missionaries working together.\n\nIf your note a member of the church you may balk at “baptism skyrocketing”. It kinda gives a cultish vibe if that’s how you see it - our goal is to baptize everyone!! I get it. Not great language from the outsider’s perspective if that’s how you see it.\nHaving been a member of the church my whole life, I’ve heard this rhetoric a lot - get baptisms. But I think this is more of a sociological misrepresentation of a deeply inward desire to share what’s good in your life with others.\nDo I want to baptize the world? Umm…do I want everyone to have world peace? Yea.\nWill baptizing someone give them peace? No. Well, not just dunking yourself in a hot-tub sized mini pool.\nWill someone who has a sincere desire to follow Christ the rest of their life benefit from being baptized because it gives them a chance to publicly commit to following Christ and thus be supported by a community of like-minded people also trying to self-improve constantly? Yea. Baptism would be great here.\nDo I want to baptize everyone? No. I would love it if everyone desired to follow Jesus a little more in their life. Learn a little more about him. So, yea I want everyone to be baptized.\nThis is the spirit which my friend is describing.\nSo doubling baptisms is this notion of a very fascinating cultural experience: we have as a church more success in helping other people discover the joy of following Christ by how we package “the message”. Yea, it’s sales at some level. What’s a better strategy? Cold calling or referrals? Always referrals. There’s trust there. The product doesn’t seem as strange. Likewise, it takes a lot to change a set of religious beliefs. Having seen someone you know and enjoy associating with benefit from the religion helps make it more palatable at first to begin discussions.\nLastly, this strategy is fascinating: focus on teaching people who already believe in God about why they believe in God, or more about His story. These refreshers help enliven the mind, no different than perhaps me going back to some Stat 121 material and just really appreciating its elegance (even though I do more advanced math in my day to day). Teach people the basics and they’ll remember what they love about it.\n\nEnd/rant.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the ultra cynical: “they just want more tithing!” But, like, if you think about it this argument doesn’t work in so many ways. Mainly that the missionaries are paying to be there (don’t get any tithing) and most of tithing goes to maintaining the church (buildings, books, temples, missions, etc).↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Lehi and his wife Sariah are at base camp while their boys are trying to get the plates (ancient record/scriptures) from a ruthless Laban. Sariah gets very nervous (v1-3), perhaps thinking they’ve been killed.\n\n\n\nWaiting in the wilderness\n\n\nThen once she sees them come back (mission accomplished) she rejoices:\n\nAnd she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them. 1 Nephi 5.8\n\nBut what if they hadn’t come back? Is this just confirmation bias?\nNo. \nSee, Sariah had been promised her sons safe return:\n\nand I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness. 1 Nephi 5.5 (Lehi talking)\n\nBecause of this (a specific promise), we often fixate in contrary to the exact thing we should be expecting.\nConsider Adam and Eve: don’t eat that one tree. Eat anything else. Everything else. Just not that one. → which one?1 this one? Oh, we ate it.\nPerhaps Sariah fixates on her sons not returning because that is what a prophet promised her.\nInterestingly, there must be a space in time between when a promise is made and a promise is delivered (see Alma 40.6–9 for similar logic). We are not told the length of that in between time. Could be today. Could be tomorrow. Who knows how long Sariah was waiting.\nAn interesting corollary: she wasn’t doubting something she wasn’t promised.\nConsider all the promises in the scriptures. Abraham is promised the gospel will be in his seed. Nephi is promised his seed will be destroyed (he was the righteous one) and Laman and Lemuel were implicitly promised their seed would remain (even though they were wicked). Joseph of Egypt promised some things, Enos is promised other things, etc. We’re all unique.\nLet’s consider Peter and John. The Lord offered them whatever they wanted. John wanted to tarry on earth and Peter wanted to be done with the earth and go to heaven. Peter seems to have gotten tiffed with John because John one-upped Peter on the righteous desires contest with Jesus as the Judge:\n\nAnd for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Doctrine and Covenants 7.4\n\n(The savior goes on to explain how both Peter and John’s desires were great.2)\nBack to Sariah - here are three ways we tend to worry:\n\nwe can worry about things promised to us. We’re just rarely promised a timeline. Trust. Wait. And see.\nWhere we aren’t promised anything, we have nothing to think of or worry about.\nWe may individually be promised different things. The path of everyone is unique.\n\nBut we’re all promised eternal life if we follow the Lord (eternal happiness):\n\nVerily I say unto you, ye shall both have according to your desires, for ye both joy in that which ye have desired. Doctrine and Covenants 7.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nim being funny here, because there’s a lot more to the Adam and Eve story - they were supposed to eat it. Point is: we focus on what we’re told not to do.↩︎\nside note: the Lord doesn’t compare Peter against John. He just says “John wanted to do more than what he has previously done.” “I say unto thee, Peter, this was a good desire; but my beloved has desired that he might do more, or a greater work yet among men than what he has before done. Yea, he has undertaken a greater work; therefore I will make him as flaming fire and a ministering angel; he shall minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation who dwell on the earth.” Doctrine and Covenants 7.5–6↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Some seeds pop up instantly (sprouts). Others can take many weeks. (Coco de Mer takes a few years to pop up). We’re above ground. The Lord is below ground. We just gotta keep watering and we’ll see what he’s promised to us pop up when He’s ready.

    "text": "The responsibility of a Father is to preside:\n\nBy divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. The Family Proclamation\n\nI’ve long wondered what this meant. Earlier in my marriage I wondered: does this mean a father leads all family gatherings, has the first or last word, or delegates who says the prayer? That’s probably because the word “preside” is used synonymously with lead with respect to church callings and such:\n\nVerily, I say unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts, there must needs be presiding elders to preside over those who are of the office of an elder; And also priests to preside over those who are of the office of a priest; 62 And also teachers to preside over those who are of the office of a teacher, in like manner, and also the deacons Doctrine and Covenants 107.60–62\n\nI never really wondered if this was “who calls the shots”, or “who runs the show” - that never felt like a thing because my father is a gentle, servant leader. But I know some wonder what the details of this phrase mean. And what does it mean for single moms?\nWell, I recently learned what I think it means. I started getting slightly more-than-average stressed with being sleep deprived after having a newborn.\nI noticed, by consequence, my kids appeared more agitated. I remembered my Mood is Contagious.\nOnce I got more sleep, I realized the kids model my behavior as a father than follow my words. The way I talk to them is how they talk to each other - for better or worse.\nEvery parent knows this.\nSo while “preside” technically means to lead a meeting, it also means to lead a gathering. Is a family not a gathering?\n\n…how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you. And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, 3 Nephi 10.4–5\n\n\n\n\nShouldn’t we preside more like this?\n\n\nMaybe we can preside more like Christ: with kindness, gentleness, and love unfeigned.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Scriptures\nThe Isaiah chapters in Nephi often get skipped. But if you skip them, we miss out on important doctrine, like how “baptism” appears in the Nephi version of Isaiah 48 but not in the King James Version.\n\nHearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or out of the waters of baptism, who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in truth nor in righteousness. 1 Nephi 20.1\n\n\n\n\nBaptism\n\n\nBut if you compare to Isaiah 48, that line is not mentioned:\n\nHear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness. Isaiah 48.1\n\nThe only reference to baptism in the Old Testament is found only in the chapter heading of 1 Kings 7:\n\nThe molten sea (baptismal font) rests on the backs of twelve oxen. 1 Kings 7\n\nThis is clearly one of the “plain and precious” things taken, or lost in translation, from the Bible:\n\nthey have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away. 1 Nephi 13.26\n\nBut we know they practiced baptism in the Old Testament because Nephi lived and taught it, and the Pearl of Great Price talks about Adam’s baptism and ordination into the priesthood:\n\nAnd it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. 65 And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man. 66 And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever; 67 And thou art after the order of him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity. 68 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons. Amen. Moses 6.64–68\n\n\n\nMeaning\n\nIt was cool to notice this today, as that verse popped out to me and that word “baptism”. It makes me wonder what else was taken from these Isaiah chapters\nHow could Joseph Smith have ideated that baptism was in the Old Testament? All records we have are that Joseph wasn’t very literate or well known in the Bible. He didn’t even know that Jerusalem had a wall and had to ask Emma (Saints Book 1 The Standard of Truth 1815-1846) This strengthens my testimony that he was inspired in translating it\nIt makes sense to me how valuable the Book of Mormon is to answer these longstanding questions.\nThose who are of the house of Israel are those who are baptized. The baptized are adopted into the Abrahamic family. This is is consistent with Galatians 3:\n\n\nFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.

Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. 2 Nephi 4.35\n\nWhat are the limitations we can put on the Lord? Here are a few that get me:\n\nThe Lord wants me to struggle on this one\nI don’t want to ask too much\nThis isn’t that big of a deal. I should pray about more important things instead.\n\nAll three of these are easily contradicted by scriptures. He does want us to struggle but struggle with him and overcome (1 Corinthians 10.13). The Lord wants us to ask for all the blessings He’s capable of giving us (Malachi 3.10), and pour out endless blessings.1 And lastly, the Lord works by small and simple means (Alma 37.7).\nPerhaps instead those three things should be exactly what we pray for:\n\nWhat can we struggle on together? (Matthew 11.28–30)\nWhat’s the gift that thou art willing to bless me with? (Matthew 6.8 )\nWhat’s the smallest piece of help I could possibly ask for? (Ether 2.23)\n\nThe phrase “ask not amiss” isn’t some indication that a secret code needs to be enacted. That to unlock the heavens, the prayer needs to be offered in the right way at the right time by the right person.\nHow can you ask amiss? The scriptures teach us. If we’re selfish, seek our own, are puffed up, are easily provoked, want revenge, are greedy, etc. then we’re asking amiss.\nBut if we’re trying to do our best to be good people and dealing with the challenging responsibilities of being a father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, neighbor, coworker, manager, etc. then we’re just dealing with life.\nWhat is life without these titles? Who doesn’t work? Who doesn’t have someone to care for?\nIt’s precisely these things that are worthy of our prayers and divine supplication.\n\n\n\nPray\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nThe Power of Habitual Prayer is a theme I’ve tried this year. I’ve grown deeply in finding healing by making sure I can have a private place to pray.\nI’ve also seen how prayers have been answered in ways I didn’t expect. That something comes unexpectedly and it turns out to be really good. But it wasn’t in the plans.\nThis is kind of like a personal manna. God delivers. Not expected. But welcomed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs eternal life not the greatest gift we could ask for? If we’re willing to ask for that, then why not for help in our temporal life circumstances?↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "I want to share my experience with how prayer has turned from not very meaningful to substantively helpful in a matter of a few short weeks.\nConsider the scene:\n\nChildren jumping on beds. Refusing to get dressed or brush their teeth or go to the bathroom. Screaming from the other room. Screaming from this room. Exhausted after a long day. I just want things to change and be different.1\n\nAny parent comes across this more than once per day.\nMost of last year I felt like I wasn’t getting a whole lot out of my prayers. A few comments:\n\nI try praying daily. But I found it hard to focus. Praying out loud helps with this, but I didn’t do it often.\neven though I felt my prayers not well focused, I do believe God heard them regardless and by praying in an unfocused state I could still get something out of the experience. I believe God looks down on us when we’re trying, rather ineffectually, to do our best\nI felt like my prayers were ineffective because I’d pray and mumble and think about work until I’d come back to me being in a prayer and then I’d say Amen. I’d always wondered what my experience would be like if I really felt a connection to God.\n\nOkay. So that’s last year. Lots of prayers. I know God loves me regardless of how effective they are. And I know they could be better.\nBack to the scene. There were several times last year when the kids were nuts and I needed to calm myself down. It was hard. I tried a few times to go and pray but just felt like “it’s not working!” Im praying! Why can’t I get to a better state of mind?! This prayer thing isn’t working for me and I’m doing it wrong.\nI never felt like prayer wasn’t good or useful. Just that I couldn’t get it to do what I wanted it to do for me: fix me. I figured: maybe I need to pray differently. Or try XYZ thing.\nOkay, so throw up a prayer and hope it sticks. Change me! I’m here.\nNope. Didn’t work. I’d still be struggling with patience in those circumstances.\nLast night I had a new experience. I did pray the same way I’ve prayed before when stressed. No, I didn’t get fixed - God doesn’t fix us like that. Instead, while praying I remembered a mindset Find the Fun that I had discovered last week. That’s all that came to mind. I left the prayer still agitated because a kid was about to jump on another kid while I was praying and I had to leave the prayer.\nWhat happened though? I was just like 20% less stressed as I tried focusing on Find the Fun.\nOkay, so the night went better than it did last week. I had something in my mind to hold on to.\nWhat’s the difference between the me yesterday and the me of three weeks ago? I changed my relationship with prayer.\nI’ve been trying to have just one good prayer per day. It’s a goal for this year. And a good prayer is one where I try to get some type of insight. Like meditation. Just pray until an insight. Setting a timer helps me. Doing it in my office or a place where I’m alone helps too. And when I’m done, I write down the insight.\nMost of the time the insight isn’t like from God or anything. I don’t hear a voice. I don’t have any mental image. The insight for me usually comes from me hearing myself pray. “Oh, I didn’t realize that was on my mind” or “oh, how did I think of that?” I’ve come to learn that this is a spiritual prayer. This is praying by the spirit. When I desire to connect with God (get something out of my prayer), I’m elevated ever so slightly (I’m grateful for small things).\nAnd that’s it: I’ve been doing this for about two or weeks now and my relationship with prayer is changing. I no longer want it to fix me. I see it as a way to try to connect with heaven in a small way.\nAnd that’s the realization: the power of prayer isn’t in the hail Mary’s. It’s in the consistent relationship with it.\nI do believe a Hail Mary is better than no Hail. So hail away.\n\nAnd now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries Mosiah 21.15\n\nThe Lord hears your cries even if you’re wicked. Pray regardless. But there is a concept of Him being slow to hear at times: feeling the effect of prayer requires consistency. But he’s happy to help any time we come to Him. He’s not vindictive. He’s not “I told you so” or “you should be coming to me more often than this”. That’s how we treat each other, with pride. God isn’t like that. Heavenly Father wants us to come to him, and he’ll hear our cries.\nTranslating this to me: i wasn’t wicked or anything. I was just a stressed out dad. But I think the principle applies: if I have a lackluster relationship with prayer then he’ll be slow to hear. Or, said another way, I’ll be slow to hear. Slow to see. More reactive. More knee jerky and less patient. More thinking “why doesn’t this prayer thing work for me?”\nSo that’s my insight. Make prayer meaningful and it starts to pay dividends slowly. Very slowly. But I also believe in compounding interest.\nif your investments gain 0.1% each day of the year, do you know what your returns would be over a year? 44% increase. So if you invest $100 today, by the end of the year you’ll have $144 if you keep reinvesting your returns. Thats insanely good! But that’s math. that’s compounding interest.2\nSo shoot for a 0.1% prayer. That’s all it’s gotta be to get massive returns.\nSo that’s the invitation: try to make prayer meaningful (whatever that means to you, not me). And try to do it consistently.\n\nBut this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness. Alma 34.26\n\n\n\n\nPray alone in your wilderness. Find somewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile writing this the insight came: I’m in the state of mind of wanting them to change. This is a mindset of control (Stop trying to change people. Stop it.). The fallacy a mind believes is “if only they’re better I’d be at more peace”. Consider the alternative: if they were peaceful but I’m still in a mindset of control. Would I be happier? Perhaps I would feel more comfortable (less noise in my ear). But I’m going to posit that a person in a mindset of control, regardless of whether they’re being listened to and their control is being obeyed, aren’t happy and aren’t mindful. They aren’t present with what is. A healthier mindset for me might be: “anything could happen, delightful that they’re food now, but it’s okay if they misbehave. They’re kids! How can I Find the Fun in this moment?”↩︎\nThe math is this: 1.001^365=1.44. Or, your daily return is 1.001. Invest $10 and you’ll have $10.01 by the end of day one. Invest $10.01 on day two and gain 0.1% and you’ll have $10.02001 by end of day two. Do this 365 times and you’ll have $10*1.001^365=$14.40↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Nephi asks a faith-opening question:\n\nfor behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands? 1 Nephi 4.1\n\nAs I wrote in An Unknown God, Nephi demonstrates the ability to find a way with his questioning. Instead of asking doubtfully, he asks faithfully.\nIt reminds me of Enoch:\n\n31 And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord, saying: Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant? 32 And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Moses 6.31–32\n\nThe Lord didn’t tell him why he was chosen. He just said “go forth”.\nThe Lord’s thoughts are above our thoughts. Too often we put limiting beliefs on ourselves - I’m not good enough, why me? Or, why would God want to help me?\nWhy not instead ask, “why wouldn’t Heavenly Father want to help me? He loves me and has promised he would help me.”\n\n\n\nAngels want to help\n\n\nI love this quote by Jared after just going through something really hard:\n\nAnd it came to pass that Jared spake again unto his brother, saying: Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is choice above all the earth? And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our inheritance. Ether 1.38\n\nJust lost your job? Who knoweth but the Lord will provide a better one? Just lost your house? Who knoweth but the Lord will give you a promised land? (They had lost their jobs and house and were wandering at this point.) I love the optimism here.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "One thing I’ve seen a lot of people, including myself, do is try to change other people.\n\n\n\nCome on! Why won’t you change colors?\n\n\nI’m not sure why this is or why we do this. Perhaps we want others to be happier and we feel in our own egos that we know the better way. Perhaps we want our own problems to go away. Etc. etc.\nThe gospel isn’t about healing others. The gospel of Jesus is about individuals coming to Him for personal healing.\nWe can pray for others, sure. But what’s the point of that prayer?\n\nTo ask Heaven to send good vibes to someone else or,\nto have the process of praying change our own hearts. (The Power of Habitual Prayer)\n\nWhen we pray, it changes us. What changes us? He does. Heavenly Father changes us through the power of the Savior’s atonement. Prayer is never about changing other people’s hearts, even if you pray their heart might be softened. But by praying for their heart to be softened, it actually softens your own heart.\nWhen Alma and their people prayed for deliverance from captivity, they prayed for softened hearts:\n\nTherefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites… Mosiah 23.28\n\nThe hearts softened, but the more important thing that happened is that they developed enough faith in the Lord in order to be able to sneak out and not be afraid of being hunted down or what not. Like the Israelites in Egypt it can be dangerous to just go into the desert. Takes a lot of faith. But the prayers and Miracles of Moses softened the Israelite’s hearts and prepared them to follow Moses.\nBut what about Alma praying for his kids?\n\nBehold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith. Mosiah 27.14\n\nSurely this is about God sending an angel to change someone. Pray hard and miracles happen, even if they don’t see an angel.\nBut the reality is more nuanced.\n\nAnd now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off. Mosiah 27.16\n\nThe angel didn’t come to change Alma.\nBut you’d think there would be a strong correlation between seeing an angel and changing your ways though, right? A piece of counter evidence is found with Laman and Lemuel who were visited by an angel while bearing up Nephi:\n\nAnd after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us? 1 Nephi 3.31\n\nOr what about the people who saw Jesus heal and then condemn him for doing so on a Sunday? Evidence abounds that spiritual encounters don’t forcibly change us. Angelic visitations don’t change us. Jesus appearing to people didn’t change them.\nThis is agency. This is Heavenly Father’s plan.\nWhen Alma saw the angel, the angel said “I’m visiting you to answer the prayers of your dad.” So yes, absolutely, the Lord does things on our behalf because we pray. But he doesn’t change us.\nThis very same angel gave Alma an out: “even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off”…The angel gave agency. But Alma could easily have acted like Laman and Lemuel or the Pharisees and hardened his heart. It’s also why the Lord was able to do many miracles in the Americas that he couldn’t do in Jerusalem (3 Nephi): they had faith. They chose to follow Him. They had agency.\nThe gospel isn’t about us changing others through prayer. It’s about us allowing the Savior to change our hearts. This same scripture could be applied when trying to change another person:\n\nwhy beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Matthew 7.3\n\nOr this:\n\nWhen we feel hurt, angry, or envious, it is quite easy to judge people. This topic could actually be taught in a two-word sermon. When it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or wanting to cause harm, please apply the following:\n\n\nStop it! Uchtdorf\n\nInstead, find the good in others. Focus on changing and improving yourself to be more understanding, more accepting, more go with the flow.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Nephi is talking about the Lord doing a “marvelous work”\n\nAnd it [the marvelous work] shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel. Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel. 1 Nephi 22.9–12\n\nThe Lord will restore His covenants. It doesn’t explicitly say “baptism, the sacrament, the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the endowment, and the sealing ordinance”, but that’s what Nephi is referring to.\n\n\n\nThe Lord will gather us into His silo. This is His work, not ours.\n\n\nWhy doesn’t the Book of Mormon mention the sealing ordinance? The Melchizedek priesthood (the name of it)? The endowment? I’m not sure. But it’s fascinating how Joseph Smith translated this book but also received revelations to help finalize the structure of the church. # Meaning\nThis teaches me that…\n\nThe Lord cares about people who reject him. He will do His work among them. He won’t leave me even if I leave Him. That’s a powerful concept.\nThe covenants are the most important thing to focus on in the scriptures. Everything else is just context about how to best live them.\nI am gathered when I keep my covenants.

What if you took job A over B? What if I hadn’t broken my wrist? What if I had moved into X house vs. Y - who would I have met?\nI’m not sure we’re supposed to know how it could otherwise have turned out. I’m not sure it matters much, either. Because I’m sure there were a lot of good people who weren’t prompted like Lehi to leave. (Consider how Abinadi had to stay.)\nSo I take this as “that’s interesting.” In this case, Lehi got to know the alternative ending to the story. He got to learn that he had avoided destruction in Jerusalem and could instead finish his days peacefully in his promised land.\nWe also often compare our lives to how perhaps it could have been better (thanks social media).

Today, I experienced another one.\n\nA Typical Day\nI felt overwhelmed by a few things (just day to day life, parenting, working, making sure I get that insurance policy and that bill figured out, etc, etc, etc.)\nI decided to see if prayer could help me get out of my funk.\n\n\n\nPray for help in all things, and watch the Hand of the Lord reveal itself\n\n\nDuring my prayer, I felt something happen. I decided I would pray until I felt a change. And I did. I felt a change. More hope entered in. (“It’s all gonna be fine!”) I felt more grateful for the help I failed to fully appreciate just moments ago.\nWe get into moods. And bad moods are hard to get out of. But this is life. Life is full of bad moods.\n\n\nWhat do you do to fix your bad mood?\nThis quote came to mind while I was praying:\n\nAs you think celestial, you will find yourself avoiding anything that robs you of your agency. Any addiction—be it gaming, gambling, debt, drugs, alcohol, anger, pornography, sex, or even food﻿—offends God. Why? Because your obsession becomes your god. You look to it rather than to Him for solace.\n“Think Celestial!”, Russell M. Nelson\n\nYou don’t need an addiction to appreciate the sentiment here: where do you turn when you’re struggling?\nDo you turn to social media? Phone calls? News? The internet? TV? Anger? Food?\nI’ve tried all those things. They’re all wonderful (except anger lol), especially calling a friend. But am I doing that before taking the issue to the Lord?\nHe has invited us to take all things to Him. Every thought even:\n\nLook unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.\nDoctrine and Covenants 6.36\n\nAnd we take all things to Him so He can consecrate them to us:\n\nye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.\n2 Nephi 32.9\n\nYes, the Lord blesses us even when we don’t pray. But the promise is in the prayer: pray in all things. Pray in every thought. Do all things for Good reasons.\nAnd he didn’t qualify what “labor” means here:\n\nCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\nMatthew 11.28–30\n\nPerhaps He wants us to decide what our labor is, bring it to Him, and consecrate it and ask His help. This seems aligned with Him wanting us to be agents:\n\nFor the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.\nDoctrine and Covenants 58.28\n\n(This comes after “Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;” Doctrine and Covenants 58.27)\n\n\nLet God Prevail\nSo: get an idea of some good cause to be engaged in (parenting, providing for family, etc), pray for support in it, ask Him to consecrate it, watch for miracles.\nI think we find reasons for why we shouldn’t pray.1 Because we think we need to do it on our own. There’s a constant balance between “how much do I rely on God and how much should I just get up and do it myself”. I think the balance is rather not a balance at all. Just pick a plan, ask for help, then go and do what’s in your power. The scriptures are full of examples of people who did this.2\nHe loves us. He wants us to succeed. He cares about our daily labor, whether that’s in a field or in the barn that a home turns into. If you’re still wondering, Read this cool story on David Whitmer and how the Lord helped him with his crops and how the Lord is aware of all our needs, temporal and spiritual.\nI got up from my prayer feeling “I can do this!” And the impression came “we can do this”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.” (2 Nephi 32.8)↩︎\nNephi and the broken bow, Nephi and the material for the ship, brother of Jared and the stones, etc.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Helping people. Saying sorry, etc.\n\nAnd the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost. 1 Nephi 12.17\n\n\n\n\nAll the roads we can take can confuse us. Instead, we can focus on where we’re heading\n\n\nThe temptation we all face is to be lured down broad roads. By contrast, the way of the Lord is the straight and narrow.\nOnce I was working with someone and I was writing my code a few ways, with a bunch of tries that had failed. I finally kept the right one along side the failures. The reviewer said “why do you keep this junk?” I thought; because it helps me remember the way to not do it. “Why not just keep the answer though?”\nSometimes we like to focus on the “broad” roads in a few ways.\n\nRemember all our failings, rather than focus on the things that bring us happiness. We do this as a badge of “I don’t want to repeat those bad mistakes.” Sure, the intent is good, but that’s like carrying a broken phone around with you to remind you not to drop your phone again. The effect is far more positive if we focus on the good things that come from following Christ.\nThere are a lot of paths we can go down in life. The Lord wants us to do many good things! (Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols). But there are a few roads he doesn’t want us to go down: selfishness, greed, love of money, etc. These roads are broad. There are a lot of ways to lose yourself.\n\nSo remember, “focus on the right answer”. Focus on the Savior, and walk towards him. Drop your load at his feet (Matthew 11.28–30).\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Some believe in pre-destiny. That their life is predetermined.\nSome believe there is no God and they have to do the best they can with what they’ve got, because that’s all they’ve got.\nThe truth lies somewhere in between. There is a God, and He wants us to be agents (Doctrine and Covenants 58.28).\n In data science, there’s a concept called “coalesce”. In English it means to come together and make one whole. In software, it means to fill in missing data with a default value.\nForgive the nerd talk, but bear with me here: So if you have an empty spreadsheet, and you do the operation coalesce(spreadsheet, 5) it would return the spreadsheet’s value if you had data in the spreadsheet but the number 5 if you had a missing cell. So if you have 10 rows of data in Excel but 3 missing rows, the output would be the 7 original values with 3 cells now with 5 in them. It’s a way of handling missing data, because missing data creates problems.\nWhat is the missing data in our personal lives? It’s “what do we do?” What do we do today? Tomorrow? Next year? What do we do today and tomorrow to prepare for the thing we may want to do next year?\nI’ve realized the healthy way to have a relationship with personal revelation is to operate under the constraints of a coalesce. To be whole and one with the Lord, our goal should be to coalesce.\nSome rely too much on the spirit. Hoping God will make a choice for us. But he gave us agency. He lost 1/3 of his children because he didn’t want to give up agency. And, by that right, he’s willing to lose you and me too if we’re not willing to exercise our agency. We just choose. This is life. And we must choose Him.\nIn many things, there is a commandment we can rely on. Don’t kill. Don’t steal. Be honest. Pay tithing.\nThat’s the priority.\nThen there’s the gray area stuff: love our neighbor.\nThat’s the agency.\nThen there’s the really gray area: have joy. Among this is “provide for a family” and “raise them the best way you can”.\nSo, use a coalesce. Your default value is what you want to do. That’s what you fill in.\nOur life should be coalesce(personal revelation, our agency).\nWhere there’s a commandment or personal revelation from the Lord, do it. Don’t wait. Do it. Follow the prompting. Otherwise, if you have no prompting or commandment to follow, make a choice! Learn. Experience. Enjoy.\nI believe the Lord will support us when we follow a pattern of putting Him first, and then defaulting to doing many good things of our own free will and choice when He hasn’t given us instruction.\nThat doesn’t mean he doesn’t care what we do. He cares deeply. It’s just more like Ether 2.23 where he wants us to come up with some good ideas.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Scriptures\nOn Sunday I was thinking about Bread given freely, like His life. It’s powerful to read this verse today:\n\nAnd the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel. 1 Nephi 19.10\n\nAlso Bread in the Oven post touches here.\nHe gave His life freely. He yielded himself.\nSo much doctrine is packed in this one verse:\n\nChrist had all power. He was a deity.\nHe obeyed the father.\nHe fulfilled prophesy.\nHe was the God of Abraham. He is distinct from the Father.\nIt was prophesied he would resurrect. Prophets in America knew this.\nThere is a space between death and the resurrection. Christ lived in that space for 3 days.\nThere are prophets who have testified of the Lord whom we don’t have records from.\nJesus delivered the Israelites. → the Israelites then delivered him unto the cross.\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord is the rancher. He controls the gate. He delivers. We’re just wandering without him\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nEvery scripture in the Book of Mormon can contain some or many truths about the Savior. There’s always something to learn.\nHumility is the process of putting the Lord’s wishes above my own, as He put the Father’s wishes above perhaps his own (yet they are one).\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, 1 Nephi 1.7–8\n\nCause and effect. First: he was overcome by the spirit. Second, he had a vision.\nBut that’s not how the vision came. First, it began with prayer.\n\nWherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. 1 Nephi 1.5–6\n\nSo here’s the order:\n\nLehi listens to prophets that Jerusalem will be destroyed (4)\nLehi prays for his people, hoping they won’t be (5)\nLehi sees a pillar of fire, sees many things (6)\nLehi returns home (assumes he’s not home), and is overcome with what he saw (7)\nLehi then has another, more pronounced vision (8)\n\nWhat a way to start off the Book of Mormon: this is a book about personal revelation, written by people who had revelations, and it teaches us the pattern. In this case, we care about others. When we do, the heavens open as we pray.\nWe prob won’t have visions, but we will have the spirit.\n\nI will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more 2 Nephi 28.30\n\n\n\n\nPillar of fire on a rock\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

He says that years before arriving in the promised land.\nBut now, years later, he testifies:\n\nnotwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. 2 Nephi 1.5\n\nHow long did it take for them to receive that land? Many years. And many hardships. Lehi complained and was chastised at some point (1 Nephi 16). So the journey isn’t without its struggles.\n\n\n\nLand of promise\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nThe Lord is with us. Even if we complain and struggle, He wants to help us get to a better place, our promised lands.\nWe can be like Lehi and seek to obtain that personal vision.

Isaiah 53.4\n\nDid He specify which griefs? Which sorrows?\nI think sometimes we can limit in our minds which sorrows. But since He doesn’t specify, it’s probably all sorrows. Yes. Actually, not probably. It is all sorrows.\nThe time in middle school you were teased and you cried. The time in college you failed that test and wondered what the future would hold. The time your loved one passed away. The time you got rejected in some interview/deal/relationship/etc. Those sorrows.\nIf you haven’t felt any of these sorrows, I question if you’ve even lived…\nThe Lord’s rest ironically comes when we take His yoke upon us. Just like he wants us to Receive the Holy Ghost, he wants us to receive His yoke. He wants us to join Him:\n\nCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Matthew 11.28–30\n\n\n\n\nLookin yoked bruh\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nWhen praying, it may increase the power of a prayer by holding in mind the imagery of the Savior beckoning us to be by His side. To be yoked with him.\nWhen we do, perhaps we’ll see how close He is to us. How much he knows us. But we have to come to Him to feel that. He comes to us to invite us, but it’s only when we turn to Him that we truly feel He is with us.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Elon Musk pay package from Tesla denied by Delaware judge | AP News\n\n\n\nWages\n\n\nKind of an interesting idea - what if you took the hours he worked to figure out what his hourly rate was. It’s been 7521 days since July 1, 2003, the day Tesla incorporated. That means his work has been worth 7.312M dollars per day. A quick search shows Tesla’s revenue was 81Bn in 2022, about 221M per day. So his comp is just 3% of current daily revenue.\nI’m sure I’m missing something, like how much he’s been comped in the past. But 3% for making a company what it is doesn’t seem unreasonable. Of course, that’s not 3% on last year. That’s like 67% of 2022 revenue. Indeed that’s a lot.\nMan, getting paid $7m per day is a lot of money. With $55M (assuming post tax) money he could buy literally every house in my town, at a premium of 50%. Imagine: a town called Elon. Or he could finally afford Twitter 🧐.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "It’s hard to be a minimalist as a parent. Or as…a human…in this economy. We all want more stuff.\n\n\n\nWhen in doubt, toss it out\n\n\nWith a small living space and a growing family I’ve grown accustomed to throwing stuff out. I grew up in a bigger house than I have now so there was space for everything. Now there’s space for very little. It’s actually a great feeling because I know what’s in every box (after doing some deep cleaning over winter break).\nI remember helping a friend move in high school. Endless hoards of products, products, products. Three moving trucks. Why? I wondered.\nMy philosophy now is: RAM and Hard drive.\nRAM: the random access memory. The things you see when you open doors affect your brain state. Your brain can only hold so much. If you live in clutter you have clutter. So the things you see in your house should reflect what you can hold in memory.\n\nToys should have a theme (blocks, action figures, doll house). If it doesn’t match a theme, it’s gone (begone random slap bracelet! “Afuera!!!”, (quote from new Argentine President))\nThings you see should be things you use. Don’t use flower every day? Don’t have it in the pantry. Put it in the corner thing. Cereal every day? Put that front and center.\n\nThen long-storage is the hard drive. It’s about keeping stuff you know you’ll want. This is easier to say than do.\n\nHoliday decoration? (Theme) keep those in the attic, out of sight out of mind. But when you need it you know where it is.\nYou get the point.\n\nThe same goes for code. Maintenance and search cost increase as you add garbage. When it doubt, delete code. Afuera!!\nWhen in doubt, “afuera!!”\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "The GTD framework preaches something to the effect of “get every todo item down and into a system. It may take dozens or hundreds of tasks to get it all out.” Essentially, if a task is in your mind, it will slow you down. But if you put it down on paper, it will free your mind to think on other things. Also, more ideas will come.\nI’ve put perhaps a hundred things down on paper in the last few days. Interestingly, ideas I had forgotten about came back to my mind. I wrote these down.\nThere got to a point today though where I had so much on my screen I felt overwhelmed. How will I ever sort through all this mess?\nThankfully, most of the things don’t need to get done and are either “eventually” or “someday maybe” tasks, and not “asap” tasks. So just ignore them.\nAnd secondly, I always “know” what’s most important. This documentation process doesn’t change that. It just helps me to get all the distractions out of my head and down on paper.\nSpending time organizing all this stuff seems like a potential waste. But what I realize is that it improves my just-in-time recall. If earlier in the day I planned to buy a dish scrubber in the evening, when the evening rolls around that task magically comes back to my mind. So it’s really just front loading all the decision making and prioritizing. I think our brains are capable of more subconscious processing than we realize.\n(Pause entry to buy dish scrubber…) okay, I’m back.\nAnother idea that’s having an effect on me is the 2 min rule. If a task takes less than 2 min, don’t organize it. Just do it. Powerfully, this mindset helps me to care less about two min tasks. Or, sometimes there’s a tendency to over exaggerate the stress something will cause. Like buying a scrubber could be a 10 min task if you want to find the perfect one. But if you only allocate yourself 2 min, you realize this is only a $6 decision and I have better things to do with my time.\nLastly, I love being deliberate about tasks by writing down the intended outcome of a task. It’s very easy as a data scientist to get swallowed up in all the weeds. Or, rather, when your task is to dig up a gem it’s easy to get distracted by all the weeds that need to be pulled that are in your way. So by being clear about the reason I’m diving into the data in the first place helps me re-surface less scathed. Data are a dirty business…\n\nTakeaways\nThe effect of the GTD framework?\n\nLess FOMO. By writing down everything I can see clearly that 1) I don’t have time for all of it and 2) the stuff I care about pops up.\nI don’t have to worry about what I’m not doing because I can easily say no to it as I say yes to something better.\nI can see broader connections between a litany of things. This helps me prioritize what my subconscious has been telling me by nagging me about X ideas.\nIf I start working on something not in my list it makes me ask if this thing is fealty worth my time when I know I have a ton of other stuff to do. (Recency bias I spoke about in my other blog post.)\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Products I enjoy as a dad\nThird times a charm - I hope by(/if) kid number four I’ll have this all figured out. It’s amazing how I feel so new to it all despite raising two kids in the last five years. In starting fresh a third time I feel inspired to write down some things I’m rediscovering.\nTo anyone getting started on their baby journey, perhaps these suggestions can help. Your baby is definitely different than mine, so your mileage may vary! But since I’m still using this stuff five years later maybe it can help you too. Either way, congrats and good luck!\n\nProducts I still use on baby 3\nSince I’m a mega influencer (on my very established data science blog here), I get paid $500 every time you click a link below. So please, go crazy.\nI’ll also credit my wife for figuring out to buy these products in the first place.\n\nStretchy swaddle, like this. I like stretchy swaddles because they’re forgiving. The cotton muslin swaddles are nice and soft, but if the fabric doesn’t stretch the right way you may have to redo the swaddle.\nOllie swaddle (nighttime). This thing is ridiculously overpriced for a swaddle. $70? Don’t get it. But if you do, I like it because its super easy to put on and very sturdy (hard for baby to break). At month 2 the baby gets strong and the basic swaddles are so easy to break. That and I feel like I’m gonna hurt my kid if I try to make a cotton swaddle unbreakable. Enter Velcro! I can be gentle on the swaddle but have it be unbreakable. There are a lot of random contraption swaddles that tie the baby up like a pretzel. This is your classic burrito. Insert baby, wrap right side, Velcro left side and you’re done.\nUbbi Steel Odor Locking diaperpail. I also hated the thought five years ago of shelling out $70 for a trash can. Five years since and the thing still performs. I know how well it’s working when garbage day rolls around and I open it to change it. Smells like a gentle coastal breeze, maybe. To this day my wife hasn’t changed it more than a time or two because thankfully I have an iron stomach and unfortunately she does not. Point is: it keeps the diaper smell inside (for the most part) and uses normal garbage bags (cost saver).\nBaby K’tan Original Baby Wrap Carrier, Infant and Child Sling. I’ve tried several carriers. Boba wraps take way too much patience to learn how to put on (patience I ran out of quickly as a new dad). This thing is just two circular fabric swaths, which means it takes two seconds to throw on. The convenience is huge - baby crying? Grab the carrier and snuggle up in 10 seconds or less.\nDockATot Deluxe+ Dock. We just got one off Facebook marketplace for $50 for third kid. We got it because let’s be real - sleeping is hard. The hardest thing about sleeping is the uncertainty what’s happening on the other side of the room in the crib. Grunting. Coughing. Is baby waking up? Needs a pacifier? When it’s 5am and you’re on feeding three of the night, being able to just roll over and plop the little one into the co-sleeper and monitor the situation close up is nice.\n4moms rockaRoo Baby Swing. There are a thousand ways to solve the “where do I put my baby while cooking dinner” problem. We’ve liked this one.\n\n\n\nMust Haves\n\nDish soap. Honestly, nothing gets out a blowout stain like dish soap. That and drying in the sun is a miracle worker. (Apparently this is how cloth diaper people do it.)\nApple cider vinegar for diaper rash. Once the little pimples appear, you’ll try anything to get them to go away. We just discovered this hack recently and I was delightfully surprised how easily it worked.\nThis is the right way to carry a car seat. A friend of mine that has three kids didn’t know this was a thing until he saw me do it. It’s a thing. Do it! Your forearm will thank you.\n\n\n\nToddler Time\nDown the road, these products have hit home runs for me.\n\nMunchkin Miracle 360 Trainer Cup. Every time I put this cup together I consider applying to Munchkin for a job to be their sales rep. This company has very clever designs on their products and this one just crushes it for me. Acts like a normal cup. Performs like a sippy. (I’ll admit I’ve taken a few swigs out of this just to understand how it works!)\nContigo Spill-Proof Kids Tumbler. I think we have 80 water bottles in a junk drawer somewhere. Cheap ones. Expensive ones. They all end up scattered in pieces like the zebra herd before the lion that is your innocent child. This cup is no exception: I’ve lost a straw on one already. But! If you want a water bottle you’ll have the problem of spare parts. (Uhh, this isn’t a recommendation so far…) So why this cup? This cup is just good. I don’t know. It’s easy to assemble and clean (wide top). Doesn’t spill. Kids like straws?\n\n\n\nBooks\nNot that you’ll have time to read…\n\nThe Happiest Baby on the Block; Fully Revised and Updated Second Edition: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer. I’m sure there’s a quick YouTube video showing the 5 ways to sooth a baby. (Here’s an article.) But if you like books this is a good one. TLDR: sucking, swaddle, shushing, swinging, and side are all soothing to a crying baby.\n1-2-3 Magic: Gentle 3-Step Child & Toddler Discipline for Calm, Effective, and Happy Parenting. This is for toddlers, but I’ve learned this technique has been very helpful for giving me sanity in the terrible two phase. The approach doesn’t always work, but I’ve learned when it does, which is important. TLDR: don’t talk (engage in debate) with your toddler or show emotion when they’re misbehaving. Count them when they do bad acts. That’s 1. That’s 2. That’s 3. Break time. The book explains the method. YouTube is probably a friend here too.\n\n\n\nFinal word\nFatherhood has pushed my limits in all the ways. But I thank God every day I’m a dad. I do a nightly gratitude journal of my favorite moments of the day. If I’m paying attention during the day, at night it’s always my kids that have brought me the happiest moments and greatest joys of the day.\nJust remember: the clothes/products/trips are like the tools used to construct a fine painting. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what tools you use. Nobody cares and neither will you. It’s the output that matters most. I’ve found by just really paying attention to and getting curious about my kids in any moment helps me see the beauty of it all, while distractions cause me to think I need this or that be a better dad.\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "TL;DR: Be the hen. Do work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Little Red Hen” is a classic folk tale that tells the story of a hardworking red hen who finds wheat seeds and decides to plant them. Throughout the story, she asks other farm animals for help with various tasks—planting the wheat, harvesting it, milling the flour, and baking the bread. Each time, the animals refuse to help. However, once the bread is baked and the hen asks who will help her eat it, all the animals eagerly volunteer. She declines their offers, choosing to eat the bread with her chicks, who assisted her in the work.\nSo, too, do startups everywhere struggle to get funding. 100 rejections, etc.\nAnd great products don’t get attention until there’s social proof. Many e-commerce companies understand this - sales take off as more people buy, which gets more reviews, which gets more trust - even if the product didn’t change much between first sale to the last.\nThe only difference between startups and the red hen is she perhaps had a recipe. She didn’t have to wonder, “is baking bread possible? Will the recipe be delicious?”\nIt takes a founder’s belief to see what isn’t yet so and build it anyway. Be the founder. Be the hen. Dream big. Go bake some bread even if nobody’s watching.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Been here before, eh?\nI probably shouldn’t write this post considering I’ve also written posts “blogging with Jekyll”, “Blogdown”, and “distill” before. I’m flaky, what can I say. I’ve changed my blogging framework 7 times in 5 years (I started with blogger.com and Wordpress before Jekyll, and even used Medium for 25 posts.)\nBut it’s not my fault. There are too many static site generators and it seems that Rstudio is as flaky as me. Meaning, they built rmarkdown, created hugodown, blowdown, bookdown, and distill. Hugodown is a lightweight version of blogdown, and I never figured out why it exists. Then there’s workflowr and so many other great, random products out there.\nWhy quarto for me? It seems to have all the stuff that distill has, and then some. And given its design and collaboration with Wes McKinney (pandas guy) in building quarto, and given that Wes wrote his latest book with it, I think this will be here to stay for at least 5 years.\n\n\nWhy do I avoid Medium\nWhy don’t I blog with Medium? I wrote 25 posts there over 9 months and loved it. It makes writing and publishing incredibly easy, which is why I did it. With distill/blogdown the limiting factor was I’d have to be at my computer to get a post in. I love writing on my phone - I have over 2000 journal entries with Day One over seven years, several of which are “draft” posts for a blog that won’t see the light of day since I don’t care about them after I’ve written it. I want to be able to blog frequently, a short little blurb to keep up my writing, and medium enabled this.\nBut 1) I didn’t get many views (not that I care) and 2) my writing is stuck on their platform (confirmed to me this week as I’ve tried several old, broken tools that attempt to export posts out of medium).\nI got 50x the views on my blogdown site just from organic google searching. From reading other people’s posts about leaving Medium, it’s seems that most traffic to Medium posts comes from outside of Medium.\nSo while I’m certainly not into blogging for the money, I wouldn’t mind getting the content to people who it can help. And if medium didn’t enable this, what is its purpose?\nSo I’m back and finally decided that I’m going to own my own platform. Seth Godin wrote a blog about this topic once. Why be on Medium, substack, Facebook, etc or any other up an coming platform? We’ll they’re all skewed toward the 1% of people who make money on the platform. Everyone else is wasting their time. So might as well own your content. And better to focus on writing than waste time catching up on every platform.\nAlso, it’s fun! There’s a fuzzy feeling to blogging.\n\n\nFuture of quarto?\nI’m speculating here, but Quarto can be used withR Studio, Jupiter or VS Code. The last editor seems excitingly suspicious.\nPerhaps R Studio sees the writing on the wall that VS Code is taking over the IDE world and perhaps taking over the long term future of R Studio IDE. I personally don’t see why anyone would pay for R Studio when VS Code is free and has a better interface. And while R Studio has a few better integrations for R at the moment, it won’t once enough people see the light for VS Code and turn their contributions there. I’ve been using R on VSCode for two years now and it rivals R Studio in 95% of the feature set, but 100% has better window management.\nSo Quarto seems like a great opportunity for R Studio to begin monetizing on a publishing platform like R Studio connect. Platforms like Notion and Confluence are great for everyone except data scientists trying to share reproducible research. But a quarto server seems like a great way to finally bring in Python data scientists into the markdown-flavored documentation world. (Man, I personally can’t use Jupyter/Google colab notebooks when I can use R Markdown!) I’d heartedly welcome this prospect, though I have no idea what their plans for Quarto really are.\nTill next blog post about what blogging tool I’m going to use…\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Interpretation matters\nFirst, we see the (Intercept). This is the average value of a car for every level of every feature not show. So it represents the average price of a year 2000 with 0 miles, Limited trim, without all wheel drive. This allows us to now see what the average effect of, say, year is, holding all else constant. Every unit is in terms of dollars, so we can see that for as.factor(year)2013 that 2013 cars are worth $1,267 more than 2012 cars. This makes sense.\nI scaled mileage to be in the thousands so that it’s a little easier to interpret. So we see that for every 1,000 miles you drive a Ford Edge, it decreases the value of the car by $91 dollars. This tells you a few things. One, if I’m being offered two cars that are 10K miles different, there should be about a ~$900 difference in the car.\nSecond, if I’m planning on driving my car 30k miles over the next two years, how much should I expect the price to drop just due to mileage? Well, about -$91 * 30 = -$2,730. And maybe if you bought a 2014 model, two years later it could perhaps be like owning a 2012 model today. What’s the two-year difference between a 2014 and a 2012 model? About $3,160 dollars."

    "text": "Inference\nNow it’s getting interesting! You’re now starting to remember how your mom told you to never buy a car new, because once you drive it off the lot, it’s worth significantly less. Well, we can see that if you own a brand-new 2017 model and a 2016 model, they’re about $9082 - $6166 = $2916 different. So yea, just by getting the 2017 model you’ll lose $3,000 in the first year. See how 2016 is only $502 dollars more than the 2015? Having the 2015 model is practically the same price as a 2016. So you might as well buy the 2016 model and save a year of wear.\nWell, my theory kind of starts breaking down because 2015 cars and 2014 cars are similarly spaced as 2014 and 2013 ones. So maybe I shouldn’t read too much into this. But the ability to see these trends shouldn’t stop you from asking important questions, like, why is there a difference between years?\nWhen investigating the Nissan Murano, I observed a $5430 difference between 2015 and 2014. That’s non-trivial considering the other years were equally spaced. Doing a little research I saw that Nissan changed the 2015 Murano style, and the new style was apparently worth a lot more. Turns out the same thing happened here for the Ford Edge - the 2015 model is slightly longer with redesigned interior.\nYou can also use this framework to get a decent sense for what features are important to you. Like, is having all wheel drive really worth $1,277? If you live in an area where it snows, it probably is. But if you live in Florida, you may not need it.\nNot only is this framework helpful for comparing within-make-model differences, it helps you get a sense of between-make-model differences. Say, comparing the Ford Edge with the Nissan Murano and the Toyota RAV4. The coefficient for milage on the Edge is -$91. On the Murano it’s -$83, and on the RAV4 -$61. Remember this is the cost per 1,000 miles. That tells me that if I ‘spend’ 30k miles on a car over two years, I’ll lose -$2,730 on the Edge, but only -$1,830 on the RAV4, saving me $900. This also validates that Toyotas hold their value more."

Here’s how:\n\nMake a PriceFinder: Get the residuals (actual minus predicted value) for each car. The more negative the residual, the more this car is a good price! This may be how TrueCar and CarGurus get their ‘deals’. They fit a model (probably one better than what I’ve created here) and use its residuals to value each car.\nIdentify ‘overpriced’ cars and try to possibly haggle those dealers down. Again, use the residuals here.\nUse this model to predict ‘out-of-sample’ cars. You can use this model built on TrueCar data and find a car on the classifieds or another site and evaluate whether it’s a good deal or not.\n\nHere’s an example of how we do that. First, let’s predict a hypothetical 2015 SEL Ford Edge FWD with 27.6k miles:\n\nthat_car &lt;- as.data.frame(list(\n  year = 2015,\n  mileage = 27.6,\n  trim = 'SEL',\n  awd = 0\n))\n\npredict(mod, newdata = that_car)\n\n##        1 \n## 23520.13\nWe’d expect, on average, such a car to cost $23,520.13.

As George Box said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” But here are some quick ways to improve this model:\n\nCheck for interactions. An interaction between miles and year would tell you whether the effect of miles would change across different years. For example, I think adding 10k miles to a 2017 would devalue the car more steeply than adding 10k miles to a 2012 model. During my quick research I checked for interactions, but I didn’t find many to be significant and I chose to ignore them for simplicity.\nUse a linear trend for year rather than a ‘factor’ trend. I’ve chosen here to treat year as a factor, which implies that I think that each year is completely different. Had I used year as a numeric feature, I could have possibly interpreted year as, “Each additional year increases/decreases the price by X on average, holding all else constant.” I liked the simplicity of thinking that each year was different, and since cars usually update models every four years, I wanted to be able to see where this happened. You couldn’t easily see this if year were a linear trend. Objectively, what would be a good way to choose? Fit both models and see which had better R-squared or AIC.\nDo model diagnostics. Check the residual plot to make sure the errors are normally distributed. Check for outliers. Each of these affects the accuracy of your residuals. I did some brief checks and was genearlly satisfied."

    "text": "Takeaways\nSo, a data scientist walks into a dealership with a computer with a registry of thousands of used cars on it. He negotiates with the front-office salesman. And the salesman says…\n\nNon-statistical considerations\nWhen you’re buying a car from a dealership, remember that it’s their job to sell you that car. Here are other random things I learned to think about during the car-buying process.\n\nHow many miles has it been driven, and how old is it? (We found a car with 45,000 miles in one year. That’s almost two trips around the entire world in a year! This is also 3750 miles per month (a cross-country US trip), or about 125 miles per day. What kind of driving do you have to do in a year to get that?\nHow many prior owners were there?\nWas the car previously a rental? A lease? A fleet?\nRental: Abused by X number of people? But also perhaps better maintained by rental companies?\nLease: What kind of person would lease?\nFleet: Probably a corporate car. Like a rental, but different kind of drivers.\nWhere did the car come from?\nIs there snow where they live? And do they use salt on the roads there? (Salt = rust underneath)\nWhat else does the geography tell you about the possible wear on the car (causing long-term problems)\nWhat does the CarFax or Autocheck say?\nWas the car sold at auction? When? What could the time between sales tell you about the car?\nIf someone gets into an accident and doesn’t report it, the CarFax won’t tell you. I drove 45 minutes to look at a ‘great’ deal only to learn the door was nearly falling off.\nGood luck haggling the dealer down. Car dealerships don’t usually make that much on the car, but make their money on warranties and fees. Your best chance is to haggle on the deals being offered (terms and agreements).\nDon’t get the powertrain warranty. This is like the “french fries” of the auto industry. Pure profit.\nEvery dealership has quota. Going in at the end of the month might help you, but the dealership will be packed.\nUsed cars are bought at auction. Carmax buys all their cars at auction and only keeps 1/3 of them. Local dealers also get their cars this way, and they don’t always know what the car looks like till it gets to their lot. Check the Carfax to see if any prior dealers ‘flipped’ the car quickly.\n\nUsed cars have a shelf life. If a car isn’t sold in 45-60 days, some dealerships might have to auction off the car. That means you’ll see a tiering in the price. Less-favorable cars will see the price drop several times in its life cycle. Check CarGurus to see how many times the price has dropped, and try to guess for yourself if it might drop again (or just get sold). They know their prices. They’ve got their back-office guys looking at every price of every same car within 100 mile radius. While I’m also able to get as many of those cars as available on TrueCar, I’m not able to segment by all the various features. It’s easy to webscrape for Make, Model, Year, AWD/FWD, and maybe V6 engine, but it’s very hard to get the details like leather, sunroof, twin-turbo, etc. That’s where the pricing gets really interesting.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nUltimately, a car is bought by irrational humans, and sold by more experienced ones too. So all of this data will probably go out the door when you try to make a deal.\nSo a data scientist walked into several dealerships, and left frustrated because nobody budged on their prices. Doesn’t matter how much data I have, or what I think I know, everyone’s got their price."

Pretend like it doesn’t even matter if you accomplish them. This helps free you.\nCareers are like both of these things. We want everything. We can pretend like we have it. We can come to terms with it. And we can say “doesn’t matter if I don’t get that, because I’ve got a life outside my career.”\n\n\n\nWhich path you choose isn’t as important as who you choose as companions\n\n\nConsider your career from your deathbed (My Tombstone). What path did you take that mattered? What were all the alternate realities and multiverses you could have had.\nPut them all together. In one multiverse you’ve been fired. In another you end up getting insanely wealthy. In another you start your own company. In another you become an online blogger.\nAll of them can’t be true when you do this exercise extensively enough. And choosing which one probably doesn’t matter as much (right vs wrong path thinking). If you’ve ever left a job you realize that nothing really comes over with you. Most relationships at work are short lived and contextual, like your relationships in high school. And that’s life.\nHappiness is perhaps being okay with not having everything you desire, except for the few things that are truly attainable: peace with God, self, and cherished relationships.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Businesses are Launching Like Crazy\nThere’s never been a better time to start a business. The Census shows there are over 200,000 new business applications per month more than pre pandemic.\n\nWhat’s driving this?\nListening to The Unintended Consequences of Working from Home it dawned on me that there’s a hyper acceleration of innovation happening.\nConsider the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and StableDiffusion. Chamath Palihapitiya discusses the expansive applications for these services. What was once SaaS will become MaaS (models as a service). There will be models for everything: copy writing, code debugging, converting wireframes into working apps, ad generation, book writing…\nWhile tools like ChatGPT are just in demo mode, it’s wildly apparent they’ll be an impetus for new ideas and reducing the friction of getting to the answer. For example, as a data scientist if I need boilerplate code to clean some data, I can ask ChatGPT for the 80% solution. I’m already spending 30% of my day copying code snippets from StackOverflow and making it work for my problem. ChatGPT will just accelerate that process. 10 years from now if Neuralink can read my thoughts I don’t even need a keyboard to do this…we’ll build things at the speed of thought.\nConsider this for writers and marketers. They’ll use ChatGPT to unblock them, generate ideas, and get started. Innovation across the board will accelerate because the kinetic friction to getting started will reduce to zero. You can then spend your time on the editing and refining.\n\n\nThe Best Time to Start a Business\nI digress. Why is now the best time to build a software business?\n\nCompute is cheap. Gone are the days of having to build a server to prototype and idea.\nBarriers to prototyping are nearly free and scaling with the cloud is nearly infinite. Consider how the Gas App can launch to 100,000 new users per day with just a few developers.\nModeling is now easy. All cloud services have their own AutoML tools to build machine learning models for you.\n\nThe center of all of this is scalable data infrastructure and AI.\n\n\nFuture of Data Science\nThe data scientist of today may still be using sklearn to manually do hyperparameter tuning, but the data scientist of tomorrow will either be exclusively building MaaS B2B products or be the one person in their organization who will leverage all the MaaS tools.\nIf we can ask ChatGPT for complex answers it learned from the internet, why couldn’t something similar be trained on your company’s internal data? If that’s possible, then why couldn’t you just have a Q&A session with your internal ChatGPT? Consider the following example:\n\n“Hey KITT, what are the user segments generating the most revenue on Tuesdays at 5pm?” (Analytics)\n“How many sales do we anticipate from these users next Tuesday?” (Machine Learning)\n“What ads have been most effective for us in driving new sales in the past 7 days?” (Statistics)\n“Okay, KITT, generate 3 variants of that ad for next Tuesday” (StableDiffusion generating a new Ad)\n“I like ads A, B and C. launch an experiment on Facebook/TikTok, run it for three days and dynamically allocate ad spend to the best ad.” (Business integrations, statistics, ML models)\n\nThe data scientist of the future will be the one with deep understanding of these tools and an awareness of their biases. It will be very difficult to know when they’re lying to you. The in-house data scientist will be keen on knowing the biases in the data fed into these algorithms and how to make judgments on where to go next.\nEarly stage companies won’t need data scientists because most of this stuff will be off the shelf and easy for an engineer to integrate. That means that the data scientists will join these MaaS companies to build out optimized products that solve these niche problems.\n\n\nTakeaways\nData Scientists shouldn’t be scared their jobs will disappear. They should be excited that they’ll be joining companies that automate what they’re currently doing and offer it as a service.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "The DataViz battle: Plotly vs ggplot2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "R users fall in love with ggplot2, the growing standard for data visualization in R. The ability to quickly vizualize trends, and customize just about anything you’d want, make it a powerful tool. Yet this week, I made a discovery that may reduce how much I used ggplot2. Enter plot_ly().\nFor this post, I assume that you have a working knowledge of the dplyr (or magrittr) and ggplot2 packages. I caveat that this post is backed with only 4-5 hours using plotly(), so some statements here may not be fully vetted.\nPlotly and ggplot2 are inherently for different purposes. plotly allows you to quickly create beautiful, reactive D3 plots that are particularly powerful in websites and dashboards. You can hover your mouse over the plots and see the data values, zoom in and out of specific regions, and capture stills. Here’s a basic histogram:\n\nset.seed(1)\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = ~ rnorm(1000), type = \"histogram\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a brief dabble this week in plotly, I realized quickly the many advantages that plotly has over ggplot2.\nSeveral initial impressions:\n\nPlotly handles multiple wide data columns. I always find it annoying that to color different series in ggplot2, your data had to be in long format. Granted, it takes one simple melt() command to get the data into wide format.\nPlotly also handles long format (see below).\nCustomizing the layout (plot borders, y axis) is easier.\nCustomizing the legend is easier (in ggplot2 I’ve wanted to remove just one series, which isn’t always easy).\nDocumentation is better in Plotly.\nPlotly syntax is very intuitive (learning how aes() in ggplot2 works is tricky at first)\nPlotly also works for Python, Matlab, and Excel, among other languages.\nIt’s very easy to add new series and customize them (one line, one scatter, and one bar, for example)\nYou can use other fonts (which is possible in ggplot2, but I’ve never gotten to work on my Windows machine)\nYou can toggle series on and off by clicking the series name in the legend\n\nBenefits of ggplot2 over plotly:\n\nFacet wrapping is very easy in ggplot2. (I think you have to do subplots in plotly.)\nggplot2 is probably quicker for exploratory analysis.\n\n\nConverting ggplot2 into plotly\nAn additional benefit of plotly is that you can convert your ggplot() graphs into a plotly object.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\np &lt;- qplot(x = rnorm(1000), geom = \"histogram\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, invoking the ggplotly(p) command, we see the transformation:\n\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nA draw back of ggplotly() is that if you do refined customization (like putting your legend on the bottom of the graph), ggplotly() doesn’t seem to pick this up by default.\n\n# ggplot with legend on the bottom\np &lt;- qplot(\n  data = iris,\n  x = Sepal.Width,\n  y = Sepal.Length,\n  geom = \"point\",\n  color = Species\n) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plotly doesn't pick up the legend change\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since Plotly also saves to an object, you can use the %&gt;% notation to pipe and add additional plotting commands. This is similar to the + operator in ggplot().\n\np &lt;- qplot(\n  data = iris,\n  x = Sepal.Width,\n  y = Sepal.Length,\n  geom = \"point\",\n  color = Species\n) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\np2 &lt;- ggplotly(p)\n# Use the plotly layout() command for legend customization\np2 %&gt;% layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legend doesn’t do exactly what we want, but you can manipulate the legend location manually using x and y coordinates. The orientation = 'h' setting in the docs puts the legend on the bottom for default plot_ly() objects. Graphing the same series, we see the legend at the bottom:\n\nplot_ly(iris,\n  x = ~Sepal.Width,\n  y = ~Sepal.Length,\n  type = \"scatter\",\n  mode = \"markers\",\n  color = ~Species\n) %&gt;%\n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n(You notice the Plotly X-axis title can get cut off1, so let’s put that +1 to ggplot2.)\nPlotly seems very intuitive relative to ggplot2 in doing layout customization. Things that took me many iterations on StackOverflow to figure out, like adding a black line on y = 0, are built in to Plotly.\n\np &lt;- plot_ly(iris,\n  x = ~Sepal.Width,\n  y = ~Sepal.Length,\n  type = \"scatter\",\n  mode = \"markers\",\n  color = ~Species\n)\n# Put legend on bottom, change the x-axis range, and turn on the x-axis line. \n# Also, make the zeroline visible, and turn it red.\np &lt;- p %&gt;% layout(\n  legend = list(orientation = \"h\"),\n  xaxis = list(\n    zeroline = T, # Turns x = 0 on\n    zerolinecolor = \"red\", # colors x = 0 red\n    showline = T, # Shows xaxis border line\n    range = c(-2, 7)\n  )\n)\n# Or, save parameters into a list. Use new fonts (a huge plus)\nf1 &lt;- list(\n  family = \"Arial, sans-serif\",\n  size = 18,\n  color = \"lightgrey\"\n)\nyax &lt;- list(\n  title = \"Sepal length\",\n  titlefont = f1\n)\np %&gt;% layout(yaxis = yax)\n\n\n\n\n\nThings I’d like to further explore:\n\nYou can export static plotly images out to file. My hypothesis is that Plotly images take longer to generate than ggplot2. So if I’m mass producing 30,000 plots (which I had to do last month), which is the faster approach? I would assume ggplot2.\n\n\n\nPlotly in RShiny Dashboards\nThe goal in learning Plotly was for me was to eliminate the Excel-VBA dashboard I created using for my manager. Excel has (some) benefits over ggplot2 static charts: you can easily hover your mouse over a series to see the data value, and most industry users know how to manage an Excel axes. Grated, you can build in an RShiny widget to allow the user to control the axes, but Excel comes with that knowledge base built-in. ggvis allows for the powerful library of Google charts, but I think for a reactive dashboard, plotly is a great way to go2.\nSo Plotly solved the Excel problem for me. Now my manager can click and zoom to the parts of the graph that are interesting, and hover the mouse to see the values. Just use renderPlotly() instead of renderPlot() in the server.R file, and plotlyOutput() instead of plotOutput() in the ui.R file.\nMore info here: RShiny and Plotly\n\n\nRShiny vs Plotly Dashboards\nBoth RShiny and Plotly allow for creating dashboards. Plotly allows you to build dashboards as well. If you’re just interested in only visualizing charts and trends, Plotly dashboards seem like the way to go. But to build reactivity into your dashboard (like subsetting your sample, changing date ranges, etc.), RShiny still seems like the more customizable solution.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nOverall, it seems that ggplot2 is quicker to build and find what you want. With facet wrapping, the qplot() command, and ggsave(), you can whip something up fast. Plotly is better for dashboards, as you can interact with the plots. I feel like Plotly has a better syntax and documentation, and so it may be easier to get a basic plot to look how you want it to. But ggplot2 seems to have more advanced features, so if you want to get into refined customization, you may want to stick with ggplot2. They’re both great, and serve different purposes, but I’ll be using plotly for my RMarkdown and RShiny visualizations going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may depend on your screen.↩︎\nOf course, this is relative to the chart you’re trying to make.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Self Surveillance\nI came across this article in Flowing Data and thought it was fascinating.\nI’ve been on a productivity kick lately and notice these apps have habit trackers. I’ve tried using them in the past and have realized it gets too much too quickly. But that doesn’t mean as a data guy that I don’t think it’s a cool idea. It just overwhelms me.\nWe’ll I discovered that me tracking a few habits a day is junior varsity level. Felix’s blog is how it’s done to the extreme. Clearly this guy isn’t worried about Big Tech or Big Government harvesting his personal data. I love the boldness!\nThis is just 1/20th of the full page screen shot:\n\nThe number of slices and views he has is endless. It’s crazy to see everything he’s tracking, partly I’m sure because he has fun with it and the other part because he deep down hopes there’s something there.\nHis quote on Flowing Data has stuck with me:\n\nOverall, having spent a significant amount of time building this project, scaling it up to the size it’s at now, as well as analysing the data, the main conclusion is that it is not worth building your own solution, and investing this much time. When I first started building this project 3 years ago, I expected to learn way more surprising and interesting facts. There were some, and it’s super interesting to look through those graphs, however retrospectively, it did not justify the hundreds of hours I invested in this project.\n\nThis guy probably knows himself in a way that none of us ever will. He can’t ever lie to himself and say “yea, I’m good at exercising every day” because he’s got the data to back it up. But is this the life we want?\n\n\nSelf Surveillance as a Service\nSSaaS? Apparently. Exist.io tries to find patterns in your personal data and tell you when your most happy.\n\n\n\nExist.io\n\n\nWhen I researched the Apple Watch team a few years back I came to appreciate what they were/are trying to do: correlate heart monitoring with insurance claims data to proactively identify preemptive signs of cardiac arrest and other health issues.\nThat seems meaningful in theory because information about other people can be correlated with information about me.\nBut does info about myself correlate with info about myself? Probably. I have cycles. I have common traps and pitfalls like any human walking this earth. Some pitfalls are daily, some are quarterly or seasonal.\nBut I can also take 5 minutes to ponder reflectively or talk to a close friend and identify those patterns. What’s more human?\nAnd what’s more: if you end up changing your behavior then your past can’t really predict your future. So all of the data becomes moot once it achieves its purpose: true lasting change. Because if you truly change your behavior based on the insights you glean about yourself, those past triggers and anomalies no longer affect you in the way they did. So when you experience a personal step change in life, you’re a new you. Maybe not. But maybe.\nAlso, the new generations growing up on smartphones have a unique challenge: their online identities are given to them before they’re really conscious enough to determine if that’s what they want to show the world. Parents posting YouTube or TikToks of their kids are cementing for these kids an identity they themselves didn’t choose. We’ve all gone through phases of deleting Facebook photos from 15 years ago because it doesn’t reflect our current self image. What’s to be said of giving people an opportunity to change if everything they’ve ever said or done is recorded somewhere? Twitter. Instagram. TikTok. Facebook. Every post is cementing us in a way.\nI think it’s better to forget yesterday. Because it doesn’t have to have any bearing on where you’re going tomorrow. It can if you let it. But your past doesn’t have to define you.\n\n\nTakeaways\nWould you rather spend hours setting up digital automatic and manual tracking systems just to learn what you could by opening a gratitude journal every day? Sometimes less is more. I don’t think digital self surveillance is a direction we should go. (Not to mention the moment you do get hacked you’ll deeply regret it.)\nEven blogging can be dangerous for your career. Never know what’s gonna come back to haunt you years later.\nSo I should be careful what I say here, that is if I ever care to work for a self surveillance company in the future.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Just watched this clip:\n\nImportant discussion points: as a novice you’re worried about where to go or picking the wrong thing.\nI remember not taking an opportunity to learn C++ because “that’s not what I want to do”. In another occasion I wanted to learn PySpark over SQL because Python…\nWhile I don’t regret that choice per se, because I chose something else I was interested in, I’ve largely come to realize that I don’t care what programming language I’m using. I care about getting the job done.\nAlso, I’m probably over the 10,000 hours of something, I just don’t know what. Am I an ML expert? Data expert? SQL? Python? R?\nIs it the application of the skill that makes you an expert? I’m not sure. Because I think novices can do some incredible things if they hone in.\nIf you read one book on a topic, you’re by no means an “expert”, but you probably know more about that topic than 99% of the nation. I learned this when I spent 6 months diving into the home security industry for my first job. Pretty sure I knew more about that than anyone I spoke to. Was I an expert? I really only had maybe 300 hours. Maybe I was inexperienced. Sure.\nAnd who spends literally 10,000 hours on any one thing? Like 10,000 hours on XGBoost? Image classification? Deep learning? Machine learning? A/B testing? Spreadsheets? Generalist vs specialist, etc. if you’re an ML scientist at Google, you worry about very different things than an ML scientist at a startup. At a startup, you worry about your bigquery allocation and pipeline failures. At Google you worry about what your 5th skip VP is going to deprecate that month.\nThat’s just the nature of education. There are so many things in the world to know…that being an “expert” is a relative thing. But I agree that working hard and learning useful things helps you innovate faster.\n\n\n\nI’d change my opinion on being an expert if I needed to beat Rocky.\n\n\nLast thing, the crux is: don’t compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to yourself. That’s how you assess your progress.\nBut I’d argue: why even compare yourself to yourself? Compare your solution to the problem. Does it matter if you have 10,000 hours? No. What matters is if the solution fits. This is why innovations and disruptions come from unexpected places: because novices can nail solutions.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "section": "An Example",
    "text": "An Example\nI build data science models by building python packages and committing the code to GitHub. The python package contains all of the support files and a main.py file to run the pipeline from start to finish. The support files could contain either helpful loggers to tell me where the pipeline is breaking down, diagnostic tools such as an AUC-ROC plot, files to engineer features, or files to train different model types. So there are really these three things that could happen to my code at any time. It doesn’t matter where those changes occur, or how many lines of code changed. What matters is what’s happened to the model. Each time I get a pull request approved, I’ll update the version number in my repo.\n\nChanging BETWEEN\nIncrement the BETWEEN version for the following changes:\n\nWhen the structure of your data changes\nIf your target variable changes (how you coded it, or data that produced the target changed)\nThe underlying population you’re training on changes\n\nAssume I discovered that I had a bad join. The join change might have been a minor one, but it’s now difficult to really compare the two models because my target was affected as a result. What I was predicting, even if slightly different, is now something different. If you ever feel like you’re comparing apples to oranges when looking at an AUC-ROC curve, update the BETWEEN version.\nWith each BETWEEN change, there should be a clear communication in the release notes of why the model is inherently different from prior models. These changes should be less frequent.\n\n\nChanging WITHIN\nIncrement the WITHIN number when the following happens:\n\nFeatures are added\nData sources are added or updated. (You might have several data sources today that help contribute to the target. But adding a data source might just mean adding new features. If you add data in such a way that it changes what you’re ultimately modeling, update the BETWEEN version.)\nNew modeling types are added. (You might be using a logistic regression, but add a mo)\n\nSo if I added files that allowed me to train different model types, or added files that engineered new features, I’d incrememnt the WITHIN version. In my mind, this shouldn’t be a count of features you include, but should just be incremented every time you do something that affects the model performance.\nAt any time, you might what to view different subsets of features and their effect on the model. So, you might not change the number of features, but add some functionality into your pipeline that now produces three different models in each run. I would increment the WITHIN version number in that case.\nRemember, the goal of this type of versioning is to show generally what’s changed in your pipeline.\n\n\nChanging PROCESS\nIncrement the PROCESS version when the following happens:\n\nA minor bug is fixed (unless this updates BETWEEN or WITHIN)\nEnhance a logger or aspect of the pipeline\nAdd a diagnostic plot or table\n\nBasically, any time you add something that doesn’t ultimately affect the performance of the model, you should update the PROCESS version. Your changes might improve the flow of your code and make you a much happier developer, but if it doesn’t improve the model, then the key priority of your code hasn’t improved."

    "text": "Hello world.\nI wanted to start a blog. I wanted to set it up for free, use a custom URL (and not something.bloggingplatform.com), and be able to both blog and create tutorials. I didn’t mind it possibly being technical1. Enter Jekyll.\nIf you want to get your blog in 10 minutes, skip to below.\n\nWhy Blog with Jekyll?\nHere’s why you can and should blog with Jekyll (if you’re a data scientist):\n\nJekyll has beautiful, free, open-source templates.\nGitHub will host your website for free2.\nJekyll is static.\nJekyll can be simple to set up3.\nI tried Wordpress and blogger.com and got frustrated.\nThe blogging content you create is very portable (easy to take your posts from one blog site to another).\nCreating blogs in Markdown syntax is a dream (even for non-technical folks).\nYou can manage your blog from your terminal\nYou can manage your blog from your phone (if you have a GitHub-editing app)\n\nBut if you don’t like debugging occasional errors, you probably shouldn’t blog with Jekyll.\nWhat is Jekyll, you ask? Jekyll is an open-source blogging platform. Anyone can write a template and post it, and anyone else can use that template. Perusing Jekyllthemes.org, you can pick out any template you’d like.\n\n\nHow did I get started with Jekyll?\nAs a blogging noob, I’ve discovered there are hundreds of ways to generate a blog (e.g., WordPress, Squarespace, blogger.com, Weebly, etc.). But when my colleague Arthur Lui showed me his blog, I wanted something similar. I first tried Wordpress, then tried blogspot, then gave up and followed Arthur’s example and landed with Jekyll.\n\n\nSet up a blog in 10 minutes!\nI followed this Jekyll tutorial to set up my first blog. I’ll simplify those steps here to get you up and running quickly:\n\nGet a GitHub account. (2 min)\nGo to Jekyllthemes.org. All of these blog themes are free. Find one you like, and Fork the repo (i.e., “repository”). (2-60 min, depending on how long you peruse)\nIn GitHub, rename the newly-forked repo from “REPO name” to “yourgithubusername.github.io”. (1 min)\nNow go to “githubusername.github.io”. Voila, you have a blog.\n\nAnd if you want to start writing posts, go to your “_posts” folder. Then create new files and follow the default templates that the repository provides. (The blogs will need to be written in Markdown syntax.)\nThat was my 10 minute promise. If you feel a bit cheated or lost, go to the well-done tutorial and do all the steps. But the steps I listed are the essential steps to setting up a blog from scratch. So if you want to make a few blogs really quickly, after you figure out the first one the others follow nicely. For example, once I finished the tutorial, I followed those steps above to try two other themes before deciding on the Centrarium theme.\nTo get Centrarium to work, I did have to change some configurations in the “_config.yml”, so there can be some minor debugging depending on the theme you choose. But with a little patience and some Googling, you’ll get it.\n\n\nAdd to Jekyll a custom URL from GoDaddy\nYou’ll notice I have a custom URL and not “bryanwhiting.github.io”. I used GoDaddy to get a domain. (I have no affiliation with GoDaddy.) Here’s how I linked GoDaddy with my GitHub Jekyll blog:\n\nGet a domain.\nIn your Github repo, change (or create) a CNAME file in the main directory. (See my CNAME file for an example). And for the CNAME file contents, just type in the new “www” that you registered through GoDaddy.\nThen, on GoDaddy, go to the section “DNS Management”. Here’s where you tell GoDaddy how to connect your newly purchased “www” with GitHub. Create the following connections:\n[Type, Name, Value, TTL] = [A, @, 192.30.252.153, 600 seconds]\n[Type, Name, Value, TTL] = [A, @, 192.30.252.154, 600 seconds]\n[Type, Name, Value, TTL] = [CNAME, ftp, yourgithubusername.github.io, 600 seconds]\n[Type, Name, Value, TTL] = [CNAME, www, yourgithubusername.github.io, 600 seconds]\n\nIf you have the CNAME file in your GitHub folder, GitHub and GoDaddy will talk and after a few minutes your custom “www” will work. You don’t technically need the two [A] steps, but those connections allow users to type “bryanwhiting.com” instead of “www.bryanwhiting.com”. It can take up to 24 hours before these [A] connections enable, so don’t be worried if the short URL doesn’t work first try. But the full URL should work soon enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, I was interested in being able to use the command line for my posts. Additionally, I didn’t mind seeing or using a little bit of code.↩︎\nSomeone has to host it (i.e., store and display all the files). I started off trying to set up a WordPress blog, but you have to pay another company to host. I didn’t want to bother.↩︎\nIf you try to set it up by following the instructions on jekyllrb.com, that’s the complicated way. That’s how I originally started, got lost for five hours, and stopped. Six months later, I found a better way.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Link to the 1912 publication, Twas the Night Before Christmas\noriginal poem was 1820’s\nSt Nick was 4th century\nDutch brought the name “Sinterklass” to the U.S. in the 1600’s.\nSt Nick becomes red by 1931, thanks to Coke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe OG St. Nick\n\n\nEverything below is produced by GPT:\n“How long has the concept of Santa been around? Where did”st nick” come from?”\n\nThe concept of Santa Claus has evolved over many centuries, originating from the historical figure of Saint Nicholas. Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century Christian bishop in Myra, which is now part of modern-day Turkey. He was known for his generosity and for performing miracles, which earned him a reputation as a protector of children and sailors.\n\n\nThe name “Santa Claus” evolved from the Dutch “Sinterklaas,” a short form of Sint Nikolaas (Saint Nicholas). Dutch immigrants brought the traditions of Sinterklaas to America in the 17th and 18th centuries. In these traditions, Sinterklaas was depicted as a serious, religious figure who rewarded good children and punished the naughty ones.\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, especially in America, the image of Santa Claus as we know it today began to take shape. The 1823 poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” (commonly known as “Twas the Night Before Christmas”) played a crucial role in shaping the modern character of Santa Claus, including his physical appearance and the tradition of delivering gifts to children.\n\n\nLater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, Santa’s image was further popularized through various media, including advertisements, films, and songs, which contributed to the jovial, red-suited, and reindeer-driving character recognized globally today. This character represents a blend of the historical Saint Nicholas, folk traditions from various cultures, and modern commercial and media influences.\n\nHow did St Nick become red?\n\nThe transformation of Saint Nicholas into the red-suited Santa Claus is a gradual evolution influenced by cultural, artistic, and commercial factors. The image of Santa Claus wearing red clothes began to become popular in the 19th century, but it was solidified in the 20th century, particularly through advertising.\n\n\n\n19th Century Literature and Art: In the 19th century, Santa Claus was often depicted in various colors of robes, including blue, green, and brown. However, by the latter half of the 19th century, the image of Santa in a red suit began to appear more frequently in literature and illustrations. Thomas Nast, a prominent American cartoonist, played a significant role in popularizing this image. In his illustrations for Harper’s Weekly starting in the 1860s, Nast depicted Santa Claus in a variety of outfits, including the now-familiar red suit.\n\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Advertising in the 20th Century: The standardized image of Santa Claus in a red suit with white fur trim was popularized and became iconic largely due to Coca-Cola advertising campaigns. In 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to create a Santa Claus for their Christmas advertising campaign. Sundblom’s Santa was jolly, rotund, and dressed in a red suit with white fur trim, which matched the company’s color scheme. These advertisements were widely circulated and became immensely popular, cementing the image of Santa Claus in a red suit in the public’s imagination.\n\n\n\nWhile the red-suited Santa Claus is now ubiquitous, it’s important to note that the evolution of his image was influenced by a blend of historical, cultural, and commercial factors over several decades.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Imagine the following story:\n\n“In recent events, a ferocious fox savagely attacked a Turkey, who fortunately was able to escape to safety by pecking out the fox’s eyes.”\n\nSimple story. A bit gruesome. But, what in today’s news cycle is positive? How can we be better readers of the news when it’s targeted at making us angry?\nFoxes and turkeys are highlighted in the news all the time and it’s often the worst of humanity. The goal of many authors is to evict emotion from you so you’ll keep reading. Anger. Fear. Worry. Those keep you hooked.\nWhat’s the author’s motive? Often we have to guess it. Wouldn’t it be nice instead if authors were transparent about why they were writing a story:\n\nAuthor 1: I’m a Turkey conservationist with a passion for protecting turkeys from the rampant fox problem we have. Growing up, a Turkey saved my life when I was drowning in a lake.\nAuthor 2: I’m a narcissist who hates foxes because one time they ate my cat. I really just need therapy, but I can’t fathom talking to anyone about my problems. I want you to be as angry as I am.\nAuthor 3: I’m here to get promoted and if my boss sees that I have a 10% increase in viewership then our company’s bottom line increases. Im an opportunist who will say anything and take any side that will maximize company profits. How do these three perspectives change the storyline?\n\nWouldn’t it be great if we could know the author in addition to what the author is writing about? Every article should have not just “about the author” but, “three people’s perspectives about the author’s intent in writing this that know the author well.” Of course, you’d need to verify the three verifiers, but it’d be a start\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Last night I went to a tapas style restaurant. I got 5 things. Then we opted for one more: battered cod tacos. Our taste buds rewarded us. That’s why we came.\nBefore that I was telling my wife, “I don’t see why my friend didn’t like the sushi. It’s fine. I just don’t know how to evaluate if something is worth it or not. Because it’s tasty, I’d recommend it…” This came off the heels of multiple times recently where I’ve gone out with people who are foodies that criticize the meal I’m enjoying and I’m left wondering: am I a food plebe?\nExperiencing this last night was poignant. The whole meal was good. Not bad. Just good.\nThen came the fish tacos.\nThat’s how it is with reading. You need to read a lot before the good and the bad start filtering out.\nAnd like fish tacos, maybe there are even better ones out there, but I needed this one to point me in the direction of what’s possible.\nAnd to some degree, there’s a dulling of sensitivities. If you haven’t read good literature in a long while perhaps you assume it’s all fine and “why not finish this book?”\nBut this year I’m trying to read many authors across many genres to tackle just that: find the books I really enjoy reading. And then ask myself, “why? What was special there?” So that I know what to look for next.\nLast night I began The Old Man and the Sea and it was a fish taco moment. I don’t know how I’ve avoided this book so long. I’m sure I read it in like sixth grade, but does that even count? And why have I largely avoided fiction for most of my adult life? I suppose having studied something very technical in college it pushed me to stop using that side of my brain. But getting back to good books, written with such depth and creative imagination, renew me with an awareness of the dullness of business books I’ve been dwelling in.\n\n\n\nAn Old Man and His Tacos\n\n\nAnd now, for ChatGPT to answer the prompt: “in the style of Ernest Hemingway, write three paragraphs about a man eating fish tacos”:\n\nIn the style of Ernest Hemingway, characterized by his terse and direct prose, the tale unfolds on a weathered pier stretching into the gray, restless sea. The man, solitary and rugged, sits at the edge where the wood meets the water, a plate of fish tacos beside him. His hands, calloused and strong, deftly assemble the tacos with an economy of movement that speaks of a life shaped by necessity rather than choice. The fish, freshly caught, bears the scent of the ocean, a fragrance as old as time, mingling with the sharp tang of lime and cilantro.\nAround him, the world seems to hold its breath, the only sounds are the soft lapping of waves against the pilings and the distant cries of gulls, wheeling like specters in the overcast sky. He bites into a taco, the crispness of the tortilla giving way to the tender fish within, a simplicity that belies the depth of flavors. There’s a harmony here, between man and nature, a momentary peace found in the act of eating, of sustaining oneself with the bounty of the sea.\nAs he eats, his gaze is drawn to the horizon, where the gray of the sea blends indistinguishably with the sky. There’s a contemplation in his eyes, a man adrift in his thoughts as he is in life, finding solace in the simple pleasure of a meal. The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself—uncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction. In this moment, on this pier, the man and the sea are one, their stories intertwined in the quiet, unspoken understanding that life, in all its forms, is a series of solitary moments shared with the world.\n\nDang…“life shaped by necessity rather than choice” and “The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself—uncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction.” I’m glad Ernest is somewhere in there, AI. You may have a soul after all.\nSee also: Reading Ethos\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

That also means you have a 97% chance you won’t succeed 5 times in a row.\n\n\n\nFlipping five coins will almost certainly yield at least tails\n\n\nIn life, we sometimes overemphasize winning. Even in the tech world of wanting to fail fast, I think most people just really want to win every time. Nobody seeks failure - that’s not the goal. They seek other things (learning, promotions, making more money).\nWhen making decisions, it’s easy to black-and-white them. If there’s only a 3% change we’ll win 5 times in a row (with a 50% chance of winning every time), there’s a 97% chance you’ll fail at least once every 5 attempts.\nIf your probability of success is lower, then the odds of failing at once in five are almost 100%.\nHow do you quantify a life decision though? Maybe you only get one big choice a year (job change, like as is discussed in How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices). Is there a 50% chance of “success”? If so, every five years you’re highly likely to “fail”.\nPer the book, it’s more likely that one bad thing happens and we hindsight bias our decision and black-and-white it.\nReality is: getting fired or your startup blowing up might be the best thing that ever happens to you. You just don’t know. Your story isn’t written yet. And actually, it’s not so much about if you made the right choice as if you just make the choice right in some way.\nChoose your love, and then love your choice, as they say.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

What would having a PhD give you that I don’t have?\nWell, I trust you more if you had one.\nJeremy Howard, a world renowned research and creator of fast.ai and answers.ai started his lectures on deep learning with “you don’t need to have a math degree, you just need to know a little bit of code”. With that philosophy he’s helped entrepreneurs create amazing products that left his free online program.\n\nBlindspots tho\nConcepts are important to understand. Understanding your training data and how the machines learn from them and the biases they’re prone to is very useful, perhaps mission critical, to creating value.\nSo what’s the line? Well, if you got a PhD you’d probably spend 80% of your time on your dissertation and taking some non relevant coursework. How does that help you today?\nWell, you should learn as many concepts as you can. Like driving a car, you don’t need to know hydroplaning but you should learn hydroplaning. You don’t need to know how to drive in snow but you should know that driving a car in the snow with rear wheel drive is a different experience.\nIf you live in Arizona you don’t need to know how to drive in the snow. Your bias is you’ll never know why that would be necessary.\n\n\nPrinciple\nBe so curious that you explore the boundaries of your space such that you learn “oh, cars work differently in snow, but I don’t have snow so I’m safe”. Once you reach the boundary you probably know enough. Then ship your code and learn by how you messed things up.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Depends on the task and how detailed I want to be.\n\n\nClarify\nHere’s the system I use to clarify.\nDefinitions:\n\nTask: an action item.\nProject: an intended outcome with multiple tasks.\nEpic: an intended outcome with multiple projects.\nKey Result: high level, long term accomplishment. (Increase revenue 10%)\nObjective: a squishy, feel-good purpose statement. “Deepen relationships with loved ones.”\n\nTask grooming process: Groom the inbox every night and identify the intended outcome and next action. Tag the task.\n\nIf the task was “send Birthday card”, that’s really an intended outcome and is a small project. The tasks are 1) buy card from CVS, 2) put in envelope with stamp, 3) drop in mailbox. These three subtasks need to be understood. But a separate inbox entry may be “pay phone bill by sitting down at my computer at 10pm”. This isn’t a project. It’s just a one off thing. But it can still be clarified with details.\nLabel if it’s a project or not. Use iOS shortcuts to make this really easy. For example, gg = “🎯 #Project”\nThe challenge is if I should have things as projects or as individual tasks. I would say that as much as things can be independent, keep them tasks. Like “apply for credit card1” and “apply for credit card 2” are both personal finance tasks. But they are independent.\nA task isn’t necessarily short and a project isn’t necessarily long. It’s just whether this Indy ended outcome has multiple steps or not that might be done over a few days, whereas a task is probably done in one sitting.\nIt’s assumed that unless something is a task, it’s a project.\nEvery epic has its own name. I nest epics under “Work &gt; #Epic1, #Epic2”, etc. This helps me organize my work deliverables. I have like 5 epics right now at work that will span several quarters.\n\nThen I may choose to add tags with metadata, which I haven’t figured out if this is useful yet. But “Atomic Habits” says the best way to get stuff done is to stack it. So here is my tagging system to help me stack:\n\nCommitment: ASAP, Eventually, Someday Maybe. Will I do this task eventually? Pay a bill - yes. Learn a language - someday maybe.\n\nDuration: 5min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr. 9hr (all day)\nLocation (where to do the task): Home, Desk, Car, Backyard. Most work things are done at my desk. But perhaps some can be done while taking a walk. Most personal things are done around the house or on the couch at night.\nTime of Day: “1: Pre work”. “2: start of workday. 3: lunchtime, 4: afternoon, 5: after work, 6: nighttime”\nFocus: “Deepwork” or “shallow”. Deep work should be uninterrupted and be 3 hours long.\nSeverity: S1: if I don’t do this nothing will happen. S3: not doing this will have bad consequences or lots of regret. S2 - in between :).\nDeadline: I’m still thinking about this one. To me there’s a difference between mowing the law which has a linear cost of looking worse each day for not being cut and failing to pay my taxes, which has festeringly worse consequences the longer I put it off (pay a fine, end up in jail, etc.). I guess this is captured implicitly in “ASAP” commitment. But paying my taxes is only a cost (preventing negative outcomes) versus the ASAP of getting my project finished (positive consequences).\n\nNone (default): no consequence for never doing this.\nBinary: You either make the deadline or never and this opportunity ceases forever.\nRolling: If you miss the deadline there will be another.\nFestering: the longer you put this off the worse it becomes, but no deadline.\n\n\nAs I write this, this sounds like overkill…classic me. I sincerely doubt it’s useful to of all of this. But having the system available will let me use what I need when I need it. If I’m still using any of this in a month that’ll be a miracle. But I’m going to start with something in mind and go from there.\n\n\nOrganize\n\nOnce clarified, move out of inbox into a list “work” or “personal”.1\nPrioritize.\nDelegate. (Myself, someone else.)\nAssign due dates and times (if not already done)\n\n\n\nReview\n\nEach night I will review the days tasks and re-prioritize as needed.\nPin the one task/project I want to get done that day.\n\nEssentialism says to take the 6 tasks of the day and choose just one. Then identify what else you need to say no to to ensure you have the energy to accomplish that task.\n\nWeekly planning session to review all of this.\n\n\n\nEngage\n\nDon’t work on any tasks in a day/week that weren’t planned for that day (unless something comes up).\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA task system should be saving me time, not consuming it. It should be relaxing me and my anxieties, not amplifying them. I’m going to give this 30 days and see if my stress decreases and productivity increase. If so, I’ll keep using this system.\nGTD states that by not writing down all the ideas, you waste energy because things come back to nag you later. But surely energy is wasted by organizing a valueless idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags and lists are identical except Lists have sections and views (such as Kanban). In a list you can sort by tag and vice versa. But each task can only appear in one list whereas tags are infinite. I noticed that choosing which list something belongs to can be cumbersome if it’s in a nested list, so I want only high level lists (no folders) and have this be simple. I also have “personal” and “work” tags which have projects within them, so I don’t really see why I’d need to duplicate this. On second thought, each task can only belong to one work project so it’d make sense for this to be my grouping. I suppose I just don’t want to manage all that. Or, I chose to use tags to manage my projects because I was cheap and I can only have 9 lists on the free version but unlimited tags? Either way this is easy to reorganize later if I choose to switch. Tags it is for now.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "title": "A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Tim Ferris describes why he doesn’t have social media on his phone:\n\nI recently deleted social media from my phone 14 days ago. I had been using Instagram until April when I quit and migrated to Twitter the rest of the year. I recently realized within days how much better I felt without social media. Happier. Legitimately happier.\nAnd why? What did I get out of it? I wasn’t growing closer to friends. That’s what texting and calling and spending time in person does. But I’d argue even texting doesn’t really strengthen a relationship because it’s so hard to properly interpret emotions and cues via text: you interpret them how you read those texts. You interpret it according to your emotional state, not the sender’s.\nPhone provides vocal emotional cues. Body language another set of emotional cues. I can get probably 70% of this out from FaceTime or Zoom. But being in person is what we’re meant for.\nThis is why we strengthen relationships locally, and fail to continue ones from high school or our previous job.\nSo what was I doing on social media? Watching clips of either strangers I don’t care about or college associates I friended (once lived locally with) that I no longer talk to.\nSo what’s the knife you’re bringing to the gun fight? When at YouTube I heard the CEO praise a team for increasing “seconds watched” by 15% by reducing the lag of the swipes between YouTube shorts (TikTok clone). The lag reduction was in the milliseconds. Meaning: they made the slot machine more addictive.\nYour attention is being bought and manipulated by the shareholders of these companies.\n\n\n\nYes, they’re targeting specifically you. You don’t stand a chance. And you have a pocket knife, and you’re 50 feet away. Who’s gonna win?\n\n\nThey A/B test everything. This isn’t morally wrong. It’s actually quite human: we all A/B test everything every day. A joke here. A smile there. We put out feelers and see if we get a reaction. Don’t believe me? Ask my kid why he keeps throwing things in the toilet!\nBillions of dollars and the brightest minds on earth are working at FAANG. Why? They need to provide for their families and academics doesn’t pay. Non-profits don’t pay. This isn’t immoral, it just is. There are very good people working there: honest, moral people. Some of the best I’ve seen in the industry. But when you get paid to maximize swipes, you maximize swipes. It’s just human nature. And some of them buy into the odd notions of “snackable content”, as if swiping for 30 minutes while on the toilet is what anyone wakes up excited to do. Keep on snacking…\nSocial media and Netflix provide a ton of value to the world in my opinion. I can use them to call anyone I want, raise money for a cause, or get likes on a cute pic of my cat (I don’t have a cat). I do see the value.\nBut the costs for me have outweighed the value.\nI do miss laughing about some random Reel. There’s nothing that can get you laughing faster than a 10 second clip paired with the right cuts and music and everything. The right meme just nails it in a way nothing else can. I miss seeing memes from my friends. But when all I do is send memes to these friends, is that a friendship?\nSince being off social media I feel like my senses have grown. I now find my kids a lot funnier, my wife funnier, and I’m able to make heavy situations lighter much easier.\nThere’s a quote in Dune that’s something like “If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken”. I’d argue my other relationships had weakened too. Time to leave the fight. I was losing.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

If I use the video shortcode then quarto will embed it as a video right in the post (doesn’t open a new browser). You can adjust the height so it’s not a massive black screen.\n\n\nSong snippet today: [2024-02-05-guitar-clouds](../audio/2024-02-05-guitar-clouds.m4a) 3rd capo, G, Em, C, G with some pinky action. \n\n\n&lt;-- This works on safari, not chrome desktop for some reason --&gt; \n\n![2024-02-05-guitar-clouds](../audio/2024-02-05-guitar-clouds.m4a)\n\n\n\nHope this helps someone!\nNote, the second way (the ![]) approach didn’t work on Chrome Desktop, but works on Safari desktop, safari mobile, and chrome mobile:\n\n\n\nChrome doesn’t pick up the audio player\n\n\nIf I inspect the HTML I can see the audio tag is created in Chrome, it’s just not showing a player or anything.\nBut the mobile audio player is picked up:\n\n\n\nMobile safari\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile chrome\n\n\n\nObsidian\nI like using this markdown syntax in Obsidian because that’s where I write my notes.\n\n\n\nThe markdown syntax\n\n\nBecause it appears like an audio player in app. The  syntax is a quarto thing and renders nicely. The &lt;audio&gt; tag is supposed to work but doesn’t in my vault. In my app it looks like this;\n\n\n\nRendered in quarto\n\n\nSo yes, the markdown link is the most usable, works on most browsers, and works in Obsidian. Just doesn’t work on Chrome Web…(at least not on my version).\nSeems also that using the &lt;audio&gt; tag breaks my quarto:\n\n\n\nBroken file\n\n\n\n\nIn Summary\nI’ve found two ways of showing audio in quarto. 1) using the image syntax in markdown and 2) using a video shortcode. The markdown syntax works great locally on my iPhone and on most browsers, but the video shortcode seems to work on all browsers.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I’ve been a huge fan of using ChatGPT on iOS to get images for this blog. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually good or not. But it’s helped me associate a post with an idea (image), which I think is incredibly helpful for memory retention. So my theory has been: some content is better than no content. The other thought is: better learn now what these tools are and how to use them because you never know where you’re going to be able to take them. They’re like learning how to drive a car: if you can drive, you can go places.\nSo how does ImageFX compare?\n\nBattle Prompt\n\na battle of chatgpt vs Google Gemini photo generators. Psychedelic. Parasitic. Enlightened. Groovy. Ethereal. Down to earth.\n\nGoogle:\n\nAnd ChatGPT:\n\n\n\nChatGPt wins\n\n\nThis is but one test, and clearly chatGPT wins.\n\n\nFast Car Prompt\n\nImage: sports car driving along the highway. Scenic. Photographic. Realistic. Focused camera, low aperture. Beach off in the distance. Windy roads.\n\nGoogle:\n\n\n\nGemini\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nSports Car\n\n\nInterestingly, ChatGPT added a camera and had the identical photo inside the camera’s viewport. I’m really not sure how LLMs are that capable, that’s some diffusion inside diffusion.\nBut winner goes to Gemini here! That nails the image best.\nAlso, Gemini has an editor that pops up that lets you swap out backgrounds or objects. Pretty neat!\n\n\n\nPhoto editor\n\n\n\n\nHuman\nLet’s see how they do on people.\n\nImage: a seven year old brother and nine year old sister. The boy has brown hair, spiked. The girl has long curly blond hair. They’re on a swing-set together. The boy is jumping off the swing while the girl is on the swing but getting ready to. A creek and a grassy hill in the background.\n\nGoogle:\n\n\n\nAgainst Google policies\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nTwo kids Swinging\n\n\nChatGPT wins by TKO on this one. Gemini perhaps can’t generate images of kids? Not sure.\n\n\nFinal Battle: Picturesque Landscape\nNothing better than a sunset, right?\n\nSunset over the San Francisco Bay. Taken from the East, the Golden Gate Bridge is in visible. The sunset is bursting through a gentle fog, angle is taken from higher in the air, perhaps 1000 feet as if from a low helicopter view.\n\nGoogle:\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\nSF sunset\n\n\nAnd a real photo taken from Google Images:\n\n\n\nWhat the sunset really looks like\n\n\nWinner here is Google Images search! Both of those photos are bad. ChatGPT nailed the fog, which Gemini omitted. Gemini is much closer to the mark but made up a city to the right. Both of them couldn’t produce the right angle for the sun. But hey, they’re both better than nothing!\n\n\nConclusion\nGemini is here! I can now use it to create images from my phone.\nAs a consumer, I think the mobile experience of ChatGPT is really great. But if I’m on desktop I may use Gemini because it gives me four variations for each prompt. And it’s free. Can’t beat free.\nBut ChatGPT can do crazy things that Gemini can’t, such as the head to head battle.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I looked at code I had written, it had my imports correctly and all - why wasn’t it running?\nThe file it was importing didn’t exist.\nI thought I created that. I swear I made it. My coworker remarked, “oh so you set up all the scafffolding but didn’t write the actual code?” I was in disbelief. maybe it was deleted by accident or stashed on another branch. But the git log shows all: the imported file never existed.\nIn Dune, Paul Atriedes has many visions and the author uses this feature to skip the book ahead three years. Paul wakes up one morning and doesn’t know what’s past or future. It’s all one in his mind.\nSo it is with software. It gets created in the mind near instantly. Coding is a burden, the journey of many failures and design choices to enable the simple vision of the mind.\nPerhaps Gen AI can help us dream software faster. I look forward to when my dreams are realities, and not the rude awakening I still have coding to do.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Principles and Core Insights\nAfter 21% my takeaways are:\n\n“My mind is weighed down by all of the ideas of things I can do.” I waste my time on todos that are just “go to doctor”, but should be “schedule appointment to go to doctor”. Anything that only takes 2 min should be done immediately. Anything longer later. But I love that clarity - I’ve often written lots of todos but not from the “next action to take” perspective.\n“Visions can be built from the ground up rather than just top down.” I’ve tried writing down big visions for my 10 year future and it never works for me. I’ve got anxiety when I try to think where I want to be in 10 years. I mean, I know I want to be happy, be best friends with my wife and kids and have meaningful relationships but whether I’m still a data scientist or a farmer by then is anyones guess. (I wanna keep my options open.) But as I look at the things on my todo list and “eventual” to do list, a different picture emerges. I know I want to be a writer (hence this blog), I know I want to travel to XYZ location, to be involved in giving back, etc. TLDR: I know things I want to experience in life. I don’t have to craft value statements and invent ideas of what to do (seems forced). Instead I can reflect on what’s currently exciting and important to me and categorize those things into high levels values/missions. This will help me when I need to prioritize so not every whim of an idea gets my attention.\nGTD book just lays out what a todo is. It breaks down the problem of doing things (big and small) into what they are (time sensitive, someday, etc). Whether I’ll follow the system is up for debate, but I love the ideas so far. It very much fits my naturally organized mind, but may not work for more spontaneous folks that don’t like as much structure and list keeping.\nMost of my “todos” have been “intended outcomes”, but not “next actions”. For example, I see I have “change car battery” on my list right now and “plan yosemite trip”. But these aren’t todos. I can’t organize and prioritize outcomes. I can only organize and prioritize actions, he says. Changing these to “call mechanic to book oil and battery change and identify an hour in your calendar”. And “open recreation.gov when walking around the house and find a campsite.”\nOrganize tasks around where you’ll do them. This is in line with Atomic habits which states to be hyper specific about where and when you’ll do something. “Call grandma when I get into my car tomorrow morning to go to work.” Or “take a moment at my desk during lunchtime to find a mechanic by opening Google Maps and plan an oil change. Find 1 open hour on the calendar.”\n\n\n\nPutting it into practice\nI’ve been using TickTick for my task manager, which has Lists (folders) where I can put my tasks and tags so I can label and categorize each task. Here’s my organization strategy:\n\nWhen jotting ideas write intended outcome and next action as my todo.\nTag with where I’ll do it and provide day or time it’s due (if applicable)\n\nMove each item to a respective list:\n\nASAP - there’s a useful urgency to this task (begin memo)\nEventually - there’s no urgency but I know I’ll want to do this\nSomeday maybe - no urgency and no commitment, but it’s an idea of something I want to do.\n\nTagging system: tag each item with either Work or Personal. Then within that, some meaningful themes:\n\nProjectName (work deliverable or personal project like “ImproveMyHealth”, “BuildApp”)1\nLocation (where I’ll do it). Around the house. At desk. In car. While cleaning the house, etc. this is habit stacking. Most work stuff is done at my desk.\nwhen I’ll do it. Stack with other activities. Examples: Before lunch.\nDuration (how long it takes: 1, 2, 4 hours, 5, 30min). This might be useful for planning.\n\nList system. Move from inbox to list when properly categorized. I like “Work” and “Personal” lists. I think since you can use unlimited tags, and tags can be nested in TickTick, there’s no substantive differ ne between list and tag. Not sure yet how to use the TickTick lists when tags are so useful. Lists of work and personal.\n\nIn summary:\n\nIdea/task comes.\nDocument in inbox.\nClarify the intended outcome and the next action.\nOrganize: tag. Set up reminder. Move out of inbox to list.\nReview and Prioritize: understand where these ideas will take you and choose your adventure.\nDo!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeciding Vision: As I write this, choosing a project might be a good place to insert a goal (intended outcome) as a project name. Instead of Exercise, the intended outcome is improving health. The goal is being able to run a 5k. So perhaps goal/objective is “ImproveHealth” and KR is “run 5k”. These goals can be identified by asking the 5 whys. If I have an idea if “go running” as my task, a good grounds-up vision exercise would be to ask “why do I want to run a mile tomorrow? Is it to accomplish something or to relax my mind? Why is relaxing my mind important to me? Why is my mental health important? Etc. I think subconsciously ideas come of what to do next all the time “I should work out” but rarely do I take the time to ask “why do I see the need to work out? What’s the greater vision here for this task?” Understanding that vision can help prioritize and build a desire to accomplish the task. If the idea “learn a new language” comes up, asking why can help me realize “oh, this is just for fun and won’t be for anything meatier than having fun! No pressure on this task and maybe I’ll never do it.” The nag to run a mile might help me realize “I need to take care of my health, and this can’t wait.”↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

The notion that some tolerate the process so they can get their grants approved and get tenure, and others eventually accept the process because that’s how they got tenure, is a sad outcome of human incentives.\nInterestingly, inventions have always happened regardless of peer review. Edison didn’t need someone to review his invention to tell him whether or not it’s a valid invention. Either the light bulb illuminates or it doesn’t.\nYet that’s exactly how things go now. So what’s the result?\nPeople write to please the peer reviewer. Social conformity. Group think.\nPeople are incentivized to game the system: write a grant that gets them funding so they can get tenure and support their families.\nThe incentive to be innovative is small, though intellectual curiosity powers through for some. The incentive to stay in line and do what’s necessary to get approved is strong.\nWe’ve also learned as a consequence of 2020-2022 that a lot of scientists can indeed be wrong. Today science is becoming less about discovering truth and more about people owning their truth…people love their politics.\nWhat makes a scientist anyway? Am I a scientist because I’m a data scientist? Because I studied statistics? I’ve never published an academic article in a journal, so is that the threshold?\nI think someone who pursues truth through repeatable experimentation is a scientist. Back in Plato’s day they were just called philosophers.\n\n\nToday’s Incentives\nThere’s a reason really smart people now work at Apple to invent the iPhone, Facebook to work on LLMs, and SpaceX to build rockets. The freedom they feel at these companies is empowering. Per “Scientific Freedom”, if the trends continue then people like Max Plank would never have been able to get the funding needed to invent what he did. Where’s the money? Social media. Advertising. And now, AI.\nPeople will always be inventive. But it’s by removing the social barriers that they become so.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

This taught me something new about the sacrament and the covenant we make with Him every week.\n\n\n\nReceive the Holy Ghost\n\n\n\nEntry into His Church by Baptism\nAfter baptism, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nBut now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt baptize by water, and they shall receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even as the apostles of old. Doctrine and Covenants 35.6\n\nThere is precedence for this, as the Savior gave the gift of the Holy Ghost to his apostles after he was no longer tarrying with them:\n\nAnd when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: John 20.22\n\nPausing on that thought for a moment, let’s consider the last sentence in the sacrament prayer on the bread:\n\nthat they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 4.3\n\nAlso consider that the last of the water prayer omits that word “always”:\n\nthat they may have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 5.2\n\nAre they contradictory? No. Because the full last sentence of the water prayer says:\n\nthat they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Moroni 5.2\n\nThis tells us that if we always remember him (the Savior), we’ll have His spirit to be with us.\nBack to the New Teatament. The Lord taught His disciples that the comforter would come to them once He left:\n\nNevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. John 16.7\n\nAnd in a prior chapter, Jesus had instructed that this was the plan - that he would give them the gift of the Comforter when He was gone. Notice the word “another”:\n\nAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. John 14.16–18\n\nPerhaps He said “another” Comforter because He is the first?\nHe further promised the role of the Holy Ghost is to teach of truth and testify of the Savior:\n\nBut when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: John 15.26\n\nThe Lord also explained how He works with the Holy Ghost. It appears that, because the Savior was with them, He was their source of truth. But as He was planning to leave them He needed to leave them with a source of truth. As such, they were being prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nThese things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. John 14.25–26\n\nThis doesn’t mean they didn’t have the spirit - how else could Peter have received His spiritual witness of the Savior? matthew-16.15-17\nWhat do these scriptures all teach me?\n\nIf we always remember the Savior, we’ll have His spirit to be with us\nHis spirit teaches us what is truth: it testifies of Christ\nHe gave this gift because we can’t always be in His presence.\nEven if we were in His presence, we’d need the spirit to let us know that He is the Christ\nWhen we receive the Holy Ghost after baptism, we are commanded to “receive the Holy Ghost” by confirmation into the church.\n\n\n\nWhat is the “gift” of the Holy Ghost?\nThis last one is powerful, because of a clarifying point in the handbook of the church:\n\n\nStates “receive the Holy Ghost” (not “receive the gift of the Holy Ghost”).\n18. Performing Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings\n\n\nOr, the “gift” of the Holy Ghost perhaps isn’t a thing like the priesthood - something bestowed upon us. (This is something I’ve thought it was my whole life - a gift I receive.) why aren’t we told to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?\nWhat, then, is legally binding about the Lord’s covenant? And what is the “gift of the Holy Ghost” as mentioned in the scriptures? (Articles of Faith 1.4, Moses 5.58, Jacob 6.8, Doctrine and Covenants 39.23, Doctrine and Covenants 49.14, Acts 10.45, and like 4 other references…it’s referenced in every standard work!)\nEven the Lord says he’ll bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost:\n\nAnd whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them. Doctrine and Covenants 33.15\n\nBecause we don’t “receive the gift of the Holy Ghost”, perhaps the gift of the Holy Ghost is instead the promised blessing of the constant companionship as a result of keeping our covenant. Things consistent with the definitions in the Guide to the Scriptures:\n\nIt is the right of every worthy baptized member of the Church to have the constant influence of the Holy Ghost. Following a person’s baptism into the true Church of Jesus Christ, he receives the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands from one who has the proper authority Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nAnyone on earth can enjoy the Holy Ghost. It teaches those of truth. But only those of the covenant of baptism, who keep that covenant and the Sacrament Covenant (To always remember Him, keep His commandments, and take His name upon us), are blessed always with His spirit. Things the gift of the Holy Ghost: its constant companionship.\n\nWhile someone is being confirmed a member of the Church, he or she is told to “receive the Holy Ghost.” The gift of the Holy Ghost is not forced on anyone. It becomes the responsibility of members to invite the Holy Ghost to be with them Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nAnd perhaps the ordinance of the confirmation is to start that covenant: “receive the Holy Ghost now, and always as you remember Me.”\nAnd why do we always want His spirit to be with us? Because the spirit is a proxy for Him: the Comforter, the Source of Truth, the Light and Life of the World. When we have that spirit, we are of the Kingdom of Heaven (on earth).\nSo when I take the sacrament every week, I’m making the covenant to always remember Him so that I can enjoy the gift of receiving the Holy Ghost always.\n\nWhy is this relevant to me personally?\n\nthe gift isn’t some separate power that I can offend or please. It’s not some separate God. Instead, the gift is a covenant. This changes my focus away from a relationship with the Holy Ghost and instead a relationship with the Savior. The purpose of the holy ghost is to point me to the Savior. And if I’m not feeling the spirit, it’s not about trying to please the Holy Ghost - I just need to begin remembering the savior in that moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Symbol\nWe break bread, but His bones were not broken. Only His flesh.\n\n\n\nBread to be broken\n\n\n\n\nScriptures\nWhenever we break the bread, I’m reminded of many things. But one that sticks out is that Christ’s legs were commanded to be broken by the Roman leaders:\n\nThe Jewish officials, who had not hesitated to slay their Lord, were horrified at the thought of men left hanging on crosses on such a day, for thereby the land would be defiled; so these scrupulous rulers went to Pilate and begged that Jesus and the two malefactors be summarily dispatched by the brutal Roman method of breaking their legs, the shock of which violent treatment had been found to be promptly fatal to the crucified. Jesus the Christ. Chapter 35. Death and Burial\n\nIt was a technique practiced by the Romans to hasten the death of the crucified:\n\nVictims in the head up position could spend several days on the cross before they died. One technique used by the Romans to hasten death was to break the legs below the knee with a blunt instrument1 (p. 25) Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion - PMC\n\nA bit graphic, but how did this technique possibly accelerate the death?\n\nAccording to those who have studied the grim mechanics of crucifixion, in order to breathe adequately, the crucified victim periodically had to push himself up using his legs. Breaking the legs prevented him from doing that, thus hastening his death. He would suffocate. Why are the crucified persons’ legs broken?\n\nBut Christ’s legs were not broken as instructed. Continuing the quote above from Jesus the Christ:\n\n…The governor gave his consent, and the soldiers broke the limbs of the two thieves with cudgels. Jesus, however, was found to be already dead, so they broke not His bones. Christ, the great Passover sacrifice, of whom all altar victims had been but suggestive prototypes, died through violence yet without a bone of His body being broken, as was a prescribed condition of the slain paschal lambs. Jesus the Christ. Chapter 35. Death and Burial\n\nWhy? Why weren’t the bones broken? Why is this significant?\nThe bones of a paschal lamb were meant not to be broken.\nIt dates back to the Mosiac Passover in Egypt (when the firstborns of the Egyptians and the Pharaoh were killed)\n\nIn one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. Exodus 12.46\n\n\nThey shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. Numbers 9.12\n\nIt was prophesied that “Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.” (Psalm 34.19–20)\nJohn testified of the fulfillment of this prophecy:\n\nThe Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: John 19.31–33\n\n\n36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. John 19.36\n\nSo while we break the bread, His bones were not broken. Just His flesh.\n\n\nMeaning\nThe details that were fulfilled at His death remind me of His prophetic life. The fact that he was killed according to the law, and the law predated him and is scripture in the Torah, is further evidence that Christ truly lived and that his life was a fulfillment of prophecy.\nLikewise, those same details apply to my life. He is involved in those details.

When he came out, He was finished as a resurrected Lord.\n # Scriptures\n\nFor as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. Matthew 12.40\n\n\nAnd he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. Mark 15.46\n\n\n\nMeaning\nChrist prophesied he’d be in the tomb three days, and He was. He keeps His promises. The covenant of the sacrament is a promise, one I can trust. For “I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.” (Doctrine and Covenants 82.10)\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Symbol\nBread is porous.\n\nIn the sacrament, the bread (flesh) is first broken, then the water (blood) is administered.\nBlood follows broken flesh. Blood flowed through the broken flesh. The pores of the flesh.\n\nBread, being porous, is also absorbent. → He absorbed our problems. He internalized them inside His flesh to the point that his own blood didn’t have space internally anymore and exited through the pores.\n\n\n\nThe pores in bread remind me of the pores that let blood for me\n\n\n\n\nSupporting Scriptures\n\nAnd lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people. Mosiah 3.7\n\n\n\nMeaning\nThe Savior suffered an enormous amount. Even the thought of imagining blood coming out of my pores evokes thoughts of feeling so much physically overwhelming internal pressure or emotional agony that it would make a human body explode.\nI can remember this when I pray. I can feel heard because He not only felt what I feel today, but he knows the future me, the past me, and the past/present/future everyone else. When I pray, I’m not approaching a distant God. I’m approaching the one that understands humanity better than any human possibly could. Someone that understands me more than I’ll ever understand myself. Someone who’s been there.\nWhen I pray, I don’t have to give pretenses, because “your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.” (Matthew 6.8)\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Symbol\nWe show up to take the sacrament in our Sunday best. There were many “sinners” who came and adored the Lord. A lady gave him oil and washed His feet. The widow gave two mites. The publicans prayed for forgiveness while the Pharisees judged them.\nWe give Him our best when we show up, as sinners, to offer Him a broken heart and contrite spirit.\n\n\n\nSunday best dress\n\n\n\n\nScriptures\n\nAnd one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat. 37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Luke 7.36–38\n\nThe Pharisees didn’t like that she was a sinner.\n\nNow when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. Luke 7.39\n\nWe are redeemed by Him when we come with such a spirit as this woman.\n\nBehold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered. 2 Nephi 2.7\n\n\n\nMeaning\nThe sacrament isn’t for those who are perfect. It’s for me, a sinner. One who sins. And is sinning and doesn’t even know it. One who is separated from the happiness God would have me fully feel because of my ignorance, my natural state. I am good. I am loved. When I pray, He already knows I’m a sinner and loves me regardless. He doesn’t want me to see myself as a sinner, but as a worshipper who has much to grow from. And I am growing.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Should you find it interesting, perhaps that’s why.\nReading The Best of Edgar Allen Poe recently I’m amazed (besides how depressing he is) at how excellent a writer he is.

People don’t know it’s AI-written. Digital GenAI images now are insanely accurate - it’s only 2024. It’s very possible great AI art will inspire us more than non-AI art (whatever that means because everyone uses photoshop anyway).\nI’m not saying we won’t find value in AI art (creative writing, digital, video, etc.). We will. It’s clear we’ll have a really hard time knowing what’s human vs not.\nBut I am saying that creativity will never disappear.

    "text": "In a recent MIT article, the author discusses how to know if you’re ready for AI adoption. It boils things down to a rather obvious four-step questioning process:\n\nHow much time would I save if I used AI?\nHow expensive is the task? (How expensive is the salary of the person doing the task.)\nHow capable is the AI of completing the task successfully?\nHow easy is it to determine if the output is good/correct?\n\nI say obvious because these are actually just questions you’d ask of any task worth doing by any person at your company. In every decision in running a business, there is an ROI question at play - what does this person cost me, what’s the return?\n\n\n\nIt’s not: “should I use AI?” It’s “how?”\n\n\n\nKnowing what you don’t know, and how to know you know it\nThe author lays out the hypothetical “I asked this ChatGPT to write something in Perl and it did it well on the second try!”\nConsider that. Do you know what Perl is? Would you know how to evaluate if the code is complete? How would you execute such code - do you know the programs to run?\nAI cannot solve these environmental, contextual problems yet. It can’t think through all the nuance. And, if you have an expensive salary, there’s a reason: you have a lot of experience. Experience to know what Perl is. Experience to recognize the code’s flaws and poor design patterns. This makes you all the more valuable with AI.\nOn the other hand, a highly creative, curious person could just ask AI “what programming languages are good for this task?” Like Neo in The Matrix when he “downloads kung-foo” into his brain, we all can get up to speed a lot faster.1\n\n\nHow do I adopt AI? (Not “should”)\nTo me, the question isn’t “do these four questions check the box”? Instead, I see AI as an always-on strategy with various ranges of usefulness:\n\nDo you care what the final product looks like?\n\nAre you okay with an 80% solution?\nIs this throwaway work?\nDo you plan to maintain this code as part of a 10,000 line code base?\nDo you just need ideas to get started?\n\nWhat are the risks in firing my experts?\n\nWho will catch the mistakes of the AI? What if it’s wrong?\nIn many aspects of your business the risk of being wrong might be a lot lower than you think.\n\nWhat can’t it do well?\n\nAssume AI is doing everything at your company - what would that look like?\nGive AI the benefit of the doubt first, then work backward from what it can’t do.\n\n\nI think that AI holds great power to aid our jobs in a lot of ways. It will replace a lot of jobs, just as there are far fewer farmers today than a hundred years ago. Those farmers are far more effective than ever before - we get more yield for less. It will replace part of your job - the stuff you know how to do but would rather have someone else do it.\nCoders will be highly automatable, especially those who think otherwise. Lawyers. Graphic designers. Marketers. This is a cycle as old as time: people and businesses who think they have a strong hold on the market (think: BlackBerry, Innovators Dilemma) are the ones who always get eclipsed. # Learn the new skillset\nHave everyone at your company use it today. It’s the new programming language. It’s the new way of authoring. And yes, prompt engineering (how you ask it questions) widely impacts its usefulness. Therefore, we all need to learn how to prompt engineer.\nThat is the new skillset: knowing what question to ask and how to pressure test its validity. In essence, the learning acceleration curve has skyrocketed, and one person can now actually be good at many things a lot faster. It’s the curious person who will win. It’s the visionary. The evaluator. The one who knows where they want to go, can discern if the steps they’re taking are taking them to their destination, and who have the ability to adapt and course correct when necessary.\nFor now, AI can hardly do things outside data it was trained on. In the future 10 years that may change. If so, we’ll all be on the edge of scientific discovery, pushing the bounds of creative work, and focusing on the nuance that will win/lose that legal case. AI will have a seat at the table. But so will we.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve read stories of people without technical backgrounds building websites with GPT. On the surface this is cool. Now do they care to keep doing that? Is that their personality? Are they going to get bored? This is the differentiator. And the people who stick with GPT to build a website and remain curious are the ones who will get ahead. Those who give up won’t.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

This isn’t anything new.\nAnd putting aside beliefs about the war itself, I see the angle here as somewhat inauthentic. It assumes tech is somehow awful.\nArms dealers will always be in the race for selling more arms, whether in peace or in war. But providing services at a discounted rate to defend an invaded ally seems reasonable.\nMy point: I wish we had more positive tech news. Tech is how we won WWII and almost how we lost it. That same awful WWII tech is how we now power homes with cleaner energy across the world. Some argue it’s how we’ve avoided a WWIII so far because it’s a nuclear war is an unwinnable war.\nTech cannot control the hearts of the men and women who wield it. It can only enable them. May we all strive for wars of words and code not wars of people or weapons, and I actually think tech helps enable that. And hopefully, we can use tech to facilitate misunderstandings and bring people to better diplomacy, ending the need for war. But that’s up to the leaders. Desires for war rage within hearts long before those desires rage within bullets.\nAs for the main stream media, I’d hope for more nuanced discussions around the uses of tech. Perhaps that’s what it’s alluding to - that war mongers are being fueled by this war.\nBut then let’s get more diplomatic leaders into office that can manage peace talks. It’s a people problem. Our government shouldn’t be run by the war machine, but by the people. And tech will always enable the people to do what they do best: be human.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Their expectations are never static – they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied.

Here are but a few suggestions: (1) We can distinguish more clearly between divine discontent and the devil’s dissonance, between dissatisfaction with self and disdain for self. We need the first and must shun the second, remembering that when conscience calls to us from the next ridge, it is not solely to scold but also to beckon.\n\n(Just dropping that in case Bezos gets all the credit for the term 😉.)\n\n\nLLM Discontent\nPeople grappling with building LLMs are facing this discontent at an alarming rate. The LLM Chatbot Arena Leaderboard is a testament to how quickly appetites will change. Many AI tool providers refrain from vendor lock in and try to build LLM agnostic tooling.\nHow do you compete? Well, most of us aren’t building these foundational models. How do they compete with each other? None of us care. We just want a good one.\nBut ask yourself, would you rather have Bard from today or nothing from 2022?\nThese leaderboards are fascinating because in 14 months since ChatGPT emerged we’ve become so reliant on these tools but yet they’re not even old enough to walk or talk by human standards. Yet we now have Bard, ChatGPT, LLaMA, Mistral, Claude, and whatever’s cooking at Amazon/Apple/Microsoft (behind the scenes as a contingency plan I’m sure) and the Chinese/Indian companies that don’t want to rely on the U.S.\nIt’s the early days of search: Yahoo, AOL, Ask Jeeves, etc. One will emerge as your favorite perhaps, like how we all use Google even though Bing probably isn’t that bad anymore (I wouldn’t know…).1\nPoint is: it’s a race to the bottom, the customer is fickle. They know this, which is why they keep releasing new stuff every 6 months.\nPoint is: as you build your LLM application, your customer will be divinely discontent with you. This is nothing knew, it’s just the age of software development.\nExpectations of what software can do are rising. Those expectations are becoming indiscernible from the magic that software is becoming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge is better than Chrome for now in LLM usage!↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Every pea is unique. But it’s still a pea.\n\n\nOnline experiments are powerful tools to see the causal impact of a business strategy. Tweak something, see what users do.\nThe limitations of online experiments is that once you manipulate your user experience there’s no going back. Users are forever impacted by your choice.\nIf you give out a credit card with $100, $300, and $500 lines, people are going to spend more on the $500 line. They might also default more because they’re less able to pay back $500 than they are $100. As a result, you may lose these $500 users forever and might impact other aspects of their life, not to mention impact the marketing department’s strategy.\nA group of users is like a single living organism, if you treat it like that. If you only measure one metric (conversion rate) on the entire massive audience, then you’ll optimize for the “average” user.\nBut nobody is average. We are all distinct. We fall into categories, sure. But to really optimize the whole business we need to optimize for pockets of users. Or, we just need to set up a system that’s personalized.\nTakeaway? Personalize your experiments where possible. Consider the ethical and downstream impacts of the experiment.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Judgment is based off reason and gut. Decisions usually rely on gut though. You have to “feel good”.\nI had seen this boss make many decisions without explaining his thinking. “Hold.” Why? The company is tanking per reports. “Sell”, but this one’s looking good!\nThe point is nobody could replicate his decision making.

If it’s not well received, either through attention, clicks, or books purchased, then most people may abandon the idea. Very few (those seeking truth), are staunch advocates of an opinion not popularly received.\nEven unpopular opinion people try out their ideas. They may rise on social media as “they want to cancel me, so trust my opinion”. That sales pitch only lasts so long as you’re a minority.\nPoint is: if your opinion gets reception, you’re less likely to change your opinion. This is a problem in politics for people who espouse something for a long time.\nInstead we should be like Galileo: show me the data.\nSo be cautious if people like your opinion because you may be at risk of not being able to change it, either through your own evolving greed or desire for social acceptance and popularity.\nThe reception of an idea doesn’t determine its truthfulness, but the ability of the idea to stand on its own.\n\n\n\nLook for the evidence, not the popularity\n\n\nI always try to think about this when listening to a popular author or podcaster: what about their idea has garnered popularity? Have they changed course in the face of evidence? I recall Amy Cuddy having one of the most popular Ted talks on Power Poses, only to have a Slate article come out that refused her research. She doubled down despite her research not being reproducible: the gold standard a scientist should seek.\nFew people are like Amy Cuddy in that their ideas cannot be easily tested and so the world lazily believes them.

    "text": "On the sports fields of high school, I was often asked, “How do you want to be remembered?” The energy behind that question is a rallying cry for someone to go out and score some goals and be victorious. Score goals → be remembered forever in the annals of high school lore, the thinking goes.\nThis question misses the point.\nIn “Ego is the Enemy”, Ryan Holiday asks the rhetorical question “to be or to do”. The mindset is that either we can focus on doing great work (spending time on action and education), or we can focus on being great (talking too much, dreaming too much). Ironically, greatness follows those who do, not those who say they will do.\nSo instead of asking “how will others remember me”, ask “what will I do for others?”\n\n\n\nDan Kiefer via Unsplash\n\n\nOn this Christmas season, remember that while Jesus Christ’s divinity has been debated for centuries, certainly he’s been remembered. He’s been remembered because of the actions he took and the kindness he showed.\nChristians believe he was the Son of God, one with literal power over death and rose from his own grave. He could calm the seas and turn water to wine. He was the rightful heir to the throne that his Roman captors sat on. He could have easily freed his oppressed nation to rest on his laurels forever.\nYet the recorded miracles we have from him don’t involve him showing moving mountains or collecting power and gold. The reason he’s remembered is because His miracles involve him spending time with individuals and in their service. He healed the sick. Caused the blind to see. He alleviated suffering.\nMay this Christmas be one where you don’t focus on what others think of you. May it be one where you enjoy following His example of doing good for others, however small.\n\nWhosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. Matthew 20:26–28\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Players against AlphaStar remarked how they felt like it was indeed being creative. Likewise, Cyberrunner (labyrinth) found shortcuts.\nAll of this points to reinforcement learning as a viable solution to getting stuff done both in the digital and physical worlds.

If we can marry digital and physical worlds, teaching the systems how to solve objective functions, the possibilities become…super/human.\nThe unique thing about a human, it seems, is that we have our objective function hardwired into us: survive. First this is “food/shelter”. Next it’s social survival.\nHow do humans figure out objective functions so fast? A human looking at labyrinth will know what to do within a second. Does it have interest/patience to sit there and learn it? Does GPT 4Vision have the ability to figure out these objective functions?\nWe learn by objective functions. Minimize wrong answers on a test. Minimize missed baskets on the basketball court. Minimize rejections in a sales funnel. Maximize great conversation and connection at a dinner party.\nHumans learn very quickly. For now, robots are being isolated to specific tasks and their results are impressive.

    "text": "How does a model work?\nThe purpose of a math model is to imitate the “data-generating process”. Meaning, if you have some data on your customers (what they purchased and when), you would hope that there’s some rules that your customers are operating under. If you knew their income, their budget, their preferences, etc then you can guess how much they have to spend at a given time. Thus, if you know how much gas is in their tank, the mileage of the vehicle, the MPG of the vehicle, you can predict when they’ll stop to fill up on a road tip. When they fill up, they generate some data. “Bob purchased $34.52 of gas on Monday at 5:43pm.” Why did they purchase at that time of day? And why did they spend exactly $34.52?\nIf all you have outcome/results data then you can’t ever make predictions. But if you know what type of car Bob drives, how often he drives, how much gas he had in the morning when he left his house, etc, you can start to predict when he’ll next fill up.\nThe assumption behind a model is that what was true in the past will remain true in the future.\nWhy have there been so many issues because of COVID? Nobody could have predicted a world wide pandemic. The world wasn’t the same. All the models stopped working. Supply chain models. Financial models. Default models. All of these assumptions across all industries started breaking down."

That’s a model.\nIf Monday is a holiday or the Monday after Black Friday, your model might be very wrong. So you estimate black Friday’s sales by looking at last year’s sales. “Last Cyber Monday we sold 2x more than we typically do on a Monday. So I’ll predict that on this upcoming Cyber Monday I’ll do 2x more than what I did in the most recent Monday”\nNow that you’re taking in some data, your building a model.

    "text": "The Essence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: The future belongs to those whom it’s always belonged\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blogger data scientist Santiago recently said on Twitter, (paraphrasing) “I’m going to focus on what won’t change”. He was worried about how coding and AI will be automated, but Jeff Bezos wasn’t worried about so much of the world changing with the Internet. Bezos focused on what wasn’t changing.\nThis thought hit me, because I think it’s relevant to what our future looks like in 18 months.\n\n\nEvery day, a new winner\nNothings more apparent that the world is going to be wildly different than the past than to hop on X and see new academics one upping themselves with the next greatest LLM. Mistral just announced a 2Bn valuation as a 6 month old company. Fast is the new pace. And it’s oddly the case that big businesses are capable of massive disruption from upstarts. They can’t afford to stay glacial much longer (5-10 years).\nWith all of this, what about this blog post won’t change? Well, the timeless principle is that the nature of the game has changed permanently. Pandora’s box was opened.\n\n\nThe rise of a new equalizer\nGo into a poor part of town and you’re guaranteed to see one thing: poor people using smart phones.\nThey have access to all the same information that the rich people have. The same excellent software. Same excellent hardware. All for a fee of $50/mo for the hardware and $25/mo for an unlimited data plan.\nSo that out the rich and the poor on the same level.\nWell now, knowledge and reasoning is as accessible as Google Maps. You don’t have to pay $20/mo for ChatGPT plus. You can use Bing, Claude.ai, bard.google.com, You.com, or perplexity.ai for free. Now.\nSure people hate on bard and want to use the latest and greatest. But even the crappiest of the four I mentioned above (granted Bing/You.com use GPT in the background), is still leaps ahead of where we were just a year ago. If we were stuck only using one of these tools forever we’d still be massively more productive than not.\nSo knowledge and intellectual reasoning is going to be commonplace amongst the plebes.\n\n\nif you value intelligence above all other human qualities, you’re gonna have a bad time\n\n— Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) October 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\nMore of the same\nSo…what’s going to happen? Well, I’m not sure human nature will change much.\nThey say “being rich doesn’t make you happier. It just makes you more of what you already were before being rich”.\nAnd so, the mentally poor will remain so. They’ll use AI for entertainment. Better video games. Better, faster content. More consumption.\nThe creatives will be more creative. Nobody will be at a barrier of being silo’d. So what if you’ve only done data science for 10 years. You know coding. It’s easy to now do web design. Or copy writing. Or art. Or…\nAnd I won’t be able to stop the masses from using Code Interpreter to do data science. The systems will only become more powerful, so cloud companies will make it easier to write sql or whatever. Heck, 5-10 years English will be the only programming language. (Who here does firmware/bit mapping anymore? Only a select few.)\n\n\nThe hottest new programming language is English\n\n— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) January 24, 2023\n\n\nPython programmers will become like the engineers who create the seeds. And the rest of us just get bigger, better, and more efficient farms. There will always be those who specialize, as there are people who write compilers today, but fewer and farther between. Perhaps intellectual interest and economic incentives will equalize.\n\n\nFestivus for the rest of us\nCompanies will become smaller. But the same human needs will need to be met:\n\nfood\nshelter\nclothes\nphysical toys\ndigital entertainment\n\nMore people will just be able to do more things. Perhaps there will be more prosperity as a result.\nAnd more people will unionize and try to prevent the change. But that’s a short term thing. Can’t last forever. A union is only as good as it’s needed.\n\n\nTakeaways\nGet ahead by focusing on what’s essential. Leverage what’s around you to develop new skills to prepare for the future. And be excited. It’s going to be a wild ride.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

My post Decisions are Like Hopping on a River Raft - decisions take you down to known endpoints.\nBring those two concepts together and on one hand there’s a trajectory - where you’re capable of going given your decisions (and mindset) and your mindset - how you perceive your circumstances.\nSomeone recently told me, “It’s not what you go through but how you perceive what you’re going through that matters.”\nI believe perception is powerful. Any negative situation can be reframed for a positive. This is mindset.\nBut the other component is also important: where your circumstances will take you if pursued every day for the next 30 years.\n\n\n\nAre you aimed toward the valley or the mountain? Neither is better, but one is probably better to you\n\n\nIf you’re an extremely happy person but you don’t take action to get out of a minimum wage job, such as spend time on self improvement, you’re going to stay in your minimum wage job (nothing wrong with that, just trying to illustrate a point).\nAnd so, to get what you want out of life you can’t just assume things will get better without any change on your part. You can 1) change your mindset or 2) change your trajectory.\nI’ve wondered whether at times in my career I was complacent or not, or whether I was growing doing what I was doing. That’s not a helpful question. Because if you’re too myopic you can miss that you doing your multiplication tables isn’t going to change anyone’s life, but if you can’t do multiplication you can’t be a machine learning engineer.\nMost days in our work are steps. Steps towards something.\nA spaceman can’t land on the moon unless they build a rocket. They won’t make a rocket unless they choose to land on the moon. And by choosing the moon they’re choosing to not open a Chinese restaurant.1\nSome roles have upper bounds. Staying at that upper bound isn’t a bad thing. It’s just a thing. Other roles open up different opportunities the longer you stick around, opportunities you won’t get else where perhaps.\nSo if you’re feeling stuck, ask:\n\nWhere will I be if I stay with this for the next two years?\nIs that directionally where I want now to head?\nIs there something about my mindset I can change today to help me reframe so that I don’t miss the opportunities already around me?\n\nHTH.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho has more impact? Well as cool as it is to land on the moon, it doesn’t actually do anything practically useful. A restaurant prevents millions of people from starving throughout its existence.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

You feel the depth of emotion from the “actions and dialogue”, rather than explicit descriptions.\nIt’s fun to contrast that with Frank Herbert’s style which is “lay out the environment, have dialogue, then draw conclusions in the mind”.\nBoth styles speak to the thought that the writing is more interesting the less you write about. They call this “negative space” in drawing. A sketch is interesting when the mind can fill in the gaps. As an artist, you just want to make enough dots that they can connect them themselves. This connecting process is the freedom and interest the mind craves. It doesn’t want to be coddled (The Coddling of the American Mind).\nBack to the book. The Old Man and the Sea can be summarized in one sentence: a tired, old, and recently-unlucky man catches the biggest of his life and it gets eaten before he makes it home.\nThat’s the surface story, and it’s rather boring when thought of that way. But you just feel so much while reading it. You feel for the old man through the young boy. You feel for him as he teeters between passing out and existing.

So a user who signs up to pay $50 for unlimited data can click one button to join a party and only have to pay $25/mo from then on. Why not just offer users $25 to begin with?\nIt’s really confusing to me as a user - why not just give me the $25 automatically if it takes nothing to join a group? Because of gamification.\n\n\nWhy it works\nI think their strategy is as follows:\n\nThey hope some people get brought in on marketing and never remember to activate a party pay. Let’s say this number is 20-40%. Perhaps these users fund the rest of the discounts.\nJoining a party pay group for free is an easy way to make your customers win. I.e., a user gets $25 off for joining. Gimmicky, but I think it works. So a user has an immediate sense of gratification - a great way to build a strong emotional bond. “Click a button to get $25 off in perpetuity? Nice!” Anyone would agree this feels better than just starting off with $25.\nThis makes users want to share and tell others. Especially if customers feel they’ve gamed the system. Who today doesn’t like a hack?\n\nBut even if (1) is wrong, and that 95% of people join a party I’m sure they’ve done the math to consider how many people they need to sign up to make the money work.\n\n\nThe Larger Strategy\nWhy would Verizon cannibalize their own sales? I switched my wife out of a $70 unlimited plan on Verizon to a $25 plan on visible for the same service. Well some customers will stay with Verizon because of its prestige and the add on benefits. But users who are cutting the cord are going somewhere else, I’m thinking Verizon wants to stay ahead of the curve. It’s a race to the bottom, sure. But it doesn’t hurt to try to win the race.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I really like the design of a blog, as I tend to think better in “post” form rather than never-ending-garden-of-thoughts. I like reading blogs because I assume the thoughts are complete. Quartz is great if you just want your own wiki. I just don’t really care about the network graphs and all and I don’t think other people reading them care either.\nI want to focus on writing and sometimes long form writing. Quarto enables a lot, is easy to setup and customize, has great search, has a ton of markdown desires (tabs, callouts, asides, footnotes), can render code (Python/R) when I want to be adventurous, and has a blog interface for posts.\nLargely they’re the same, and maybe I’ll use quartz at some point. But I’m happy where I am now.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "First half is my philosophy on the relationship between learning, notetaking, and blogging.\n\nI love to learn\nWriting helps me learn\nPublicly writing increases my focus\n\nSecond half is how I use Obsidian and Quarto, alternatives I’ve tried, and my actually flow. I detail what tools I use, how I use them.\n\nset up relative links\nHave one img folder\nUse templater to manage new post templates and relative links\nUse linter\nUse commander for toolbar palette\ndataview to find drafts\nTags to flag ideas\n\n\n\n\nI’ve had a blog since 2016. Started with Jekyll. Then blogdown. Tried medium in 2020 because it had a good mobile app and I was able to publish every day. Then I didn’t know how to get my posts out of there so I lost interest. Then I found quarto, which I was excited about because I have always loved Rmarkdown (things like tabs, executable code, etc.). Then I tried Substack, which I did for a few weeks but eventually gave up because 1) no mobile app to write and 2) how do I get my stuff off of there?\nSeth Godin writes every day, and I love his blog and take it as an inspiration. In one post he mentions how “some say do a podcast, others say write on platform x or platform Y”. (Medium, Substack, etc.) He recommends: those tools always serve the 1%. If you’re the 1%, you make money. Otherwise you don’t. So you might as well own your own content.\nI know two Instagram and TikTok influencers with 100k and 300k followers respectively. The 100k made $5k in 2022. The 300k TikToker still makes maybe $100/mo. They each put in 20 hours+ a week.\nSo I’m giving up the illusion I’ll ever make money off a blog or my content. I write because I always have. I write publicly now because I found a way to do so online, from my phone.\nThis is how I blog daily using quarto (for the website) and Obsidian (for the editor).\n\nOwn your platform\nAfter all the years blogging, giving up, coming back, etc, there are many things that are my personal needs.\n\nMobile first. I can’t write at my computer. This isn’t my job.\nFootnotes: many blogging platforms don’t allow for them or handle them well. Footnotes are essential in long content.\nCustomizable: I need to be able to add styling how I like it. This is part of the creative process.\nTags: having and filtering by tags is nice\nPortable: if I stop blogging for 9 months I need to be able to move it to the next shiny object platform. I need to own my content. I also don’t like posting on LinkedIn or Facebook directly because I see my writing as my creative work. Those platforms don’t let you save or share those links later on.\n\nRelative links: I need to be able to link to other posts. This is part of the mental note taking journey.\nSubscribe button. (Substack and Medium are built for this!)\nComments: 99% of people don’t comment, but when people reach out it feels like I did something for the world. It also makes the blog more approachable, even if nobody every posts.\nHackable/automatable: I need templates. I need code. I need to be able to automate things. (At one point I figured out how to set up automations to post straight to Instagram from GitHub actions. I’m going to bring that back!)\n\nSubstack does footnotes well, linking to notes poorly, doesn’t have a mobile editor for posts, and isn’t portable. It handles tags, subscribers, and distribution extremely well, and makes it easy to have multiple publications. But it’s got the vendor lock in.\nMedium had an excellent mobile editing experience, but again - vendor lock in. And you’ve gotta kinda buy into the Medium-way-of-doing-posts.\nAll platforms have their vibe. If you want to be popular on TikTok, you gotta dance. Although I personally love to dance, I want my site to be creative and my own.\n\n\nWhy blog with obsidian/quarto?\nEnter Obsidian and Quarto. Obsidian makes managing and editing content a breeze (things like draft management, sorting files, organizing images, etc is all super easy):\nWhy obsidian as my editor?\n\nIt makes writing markdown a breeze\nIt has tons of extensions, such as managing footnotes, linting files, spell checking, etc.\nIt makes it really easy to link to other files (relative links)\nIt makes it easy to refactor (move stuff around)\nIt works with markdown. The files are just plain text files in my Files app on my iPhone.\n\n\n\nWriting flow\nEvery writer has their flow. The tools they use should reflect their mental process of writing, and not the other way around. If you’re trying to get your brain to work like the tool does, rather than using tools that working like your brain, you’re ngmi. If you’re like me, you’ll try it for a while and then give up. (I may give up after this post, but at least this post isn’t saved on Blogger.com!)\nHere’s mine:\n\nGet an idea\nCategorize it (religious, tech, life, etc)\nCreate a file\nMark as draft\nWrite some ideas\nEdit it (if long), reread a few times\nUnmark as draft\nPost to the internet, read a few more times in live version and make edits\nTag it\nFind old drafts, finish them\nAdd an image, either from my phone camera or chatgpt. Save image in the right folder.\nWrite alt text to the images.\nCreate links to other entries.\nMake some footnotes for content that doesn’t flow\nCry and debate if I’m a good writer or if anyone is even listening anymore\nAdd a subscribe button\nshare a good one to social media\nCheck my Google analytics to see if I’m popular. Check subscribers to see if I got any. Wonder why I care anyway because I know I won’t make money off this.\nGet an idea for a new post while reading a book and start again\n\nThe process of getting ideas from a source, and writing from those ideas, makes me want to be able to connect the entry to the source (book or podcast). Sure, I don’t have to write. And sometimes writing is wasted time (writing for writing’s sake), but I enjoy it.\n\n\nMy writing flow with Obsidian and Quarto\nAt the risk of nobody ever reading this far, I’ll keep this high level, and if someone cares about something ask me in the comments.\nFirst, see Quarto from Phone to see how I set up Working Copy to sync my Obsidian repo with GitHub.\nHere’s my flow with obsidian:\n\nRead a book. Create new book note using new-post via the Templater obsidian plugin. This lets me create a new note in a folder of my choice, give a title, make a filename with a good url slug. Adds some categories automatically.\nWhen idea comes up, take note in book note. When substantial idea comes up, create a quick draft of a new post using Templater. Enable draft: true if i don’t finish.\nUse Obsidian Dataview to create a list of all outstanding drafts. I can come back and finish.\nUse Obsidian Custom Sort to sort the files in my repo how I want. This package helped me to stop time-stamping my URLs (which I thought was good for sorting). Instead, I can sort by modified time (note custom sort isn’t necessary for modified time sorting), but custom sort allows for sorting by yaml front matter.\nWhen I’m ready to post, create an image using ChatGPT app. Click on the image in the app, share, save to files. It will save to the img/ folder in my root. Next image? Saves here (iPhone remembers).\n\nAt some point I was creating folders for every blog post so I could reference images there. I’m giving this up for two reasons: 1) every file would then need to be named “index.md” and 2) more folders is more noise. So instead, I have one place for all images, which makes it easier to save and I don’t have to click a bunch of subfolders every time I add an image.\nAlso, screenshot any photos you may want to add so as to remove the location metadata.\n\nUse Footnote Shortcut plugin to more efficiently write footnotes. Add a hotkey to the mobile obsidian editor toolbar to quickly add footnotes. 1\nSet up an iOS shortcut to do a “git pull”, “git commit”, “git push” on the repo. Put this shortcut on my home page. Since I have a synced folder, this happens very efficiently!2\nSet up a github actions to build the blog using quarto render. See Quarto vs. quartz for Obsidian blog\nPublish to GitHub pages with the docs/ folder.\n\nAnd that’s it. That’s my flow. If you like this, ask me a question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis footnote is added with the tap of a button. Brilliant!↩︎\nYou can also set up an automation to sync anytime you leave the app, but I’ve found that gets kind of annoying because sometimes there can be data loss with a git pull that happens without thinking about it.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Building a Data Science culture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Always keep it simple and always bring it back to the business need.\n\n\n\nA coworker once asked me for advice on how to bring technical rigor into a non-technical culture.\n\n\nWhen the Simple Solution Wins\nA few years back I wanted to see if I could predict which NBA team would win in their next match. FiveThirtyEight is a blog that does this every day. Could I build a model as good as theirs?\nI built a few models and put up a site. Below I have a table of accuracies for each of my models compared to FoveThirtyEight’s.\n\nWhat I learned is that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight three models are only 66% accurate. In 20 hours I got a model as accurate (V02 above) as his using just team level data (win %, recent win streak, etc.) and no player data (injuries, etc.). Also my model was built using data from 2005-2017 to predict 2019 performance. His model was updated daily with recent stats.\nBut even more glaring is that if I made a prediction on a single feature (Home % &gt; Away %) I could achieve 63.7% accuracy. This feature is a 1 if the home teams win % is greater than the away teams win %, 0 otherwise. Meaning, the home team wins 63.7% of the time their season win % is higher than the away teams season win %.\nWas it worth building an XGBoost model with 30 features to get 65.8% accuracy when just a simple calculation is 63.7% accurate? Depends on business context and how valuable that 2% gain is and what the development/engineering cost of deploying a model is. But if I were you I’d start with the simple model to get it into production to start generating value and then come back later to optimize.\nCaveat: it took a lot of work to discover that feature. 90% of the problem was building the data set. So at the end, building a model was pretty simple once I had the data. (This is where cloud AutoML will take over going forward, sorry!.) And I needed the model to see the feature importance (this was the top feature.) This is a valid data science approach: use modeling to discover the patterns. But just because you have a model doesn’t mean it’s worth deploying.\nKeep it business focused: when building a recommendation system, start with “what’s most popular”. Why would you need K-means or whatever to begin? And can’t you build your own K-means by creating heuristic filters? For example: if you want to recommend me a shirt based on shirts I’ve searched, you can find all shirts of same color, price, and size and recommend those. Building a model to take into account dimensions, patterns, what others buy, etc is fine but should be a V2.\n\n\nMindsets\nThere’s a temptation to act like an academic professor and use fancy jargon when working with your coworkers. Even worse, there’s a temptation to think you’re smarter than your coworkers because you know this mathy thing that they don’t. But remember this quote:\n\nWhen they are learned they think they are wise…1\n\nThis pride power struggle is your downfall for two reasons:\n\nIt blinds you to thinking your solution is good just because someone else can’t understand it.\nIt blinds you from focusing on what matters most: getting the simplest and best solution.\n\nYour coworkers aren’t your students eating you. They’re your smart coworkers solving the same problems you are.\nA better mindset is that of a professional athlete, like a football player. They might be dumb as bricks at times but they’re all incredibly smart players. Can you explain your technical solution like a pro football player would?\n\nBad: “I built an XGBoost classification model that reduces the RMSE by minimizing the Gini coefficient on each node…”\n\nBetter: “I noticed that most users close the app after they reach this page. I tried looking at some reasons why and found a few common behaviors (DISCUSS, get feedback). I think we can predict when this will happen and here’s a framework to do that.”\n\nThere’s a temptation to think “I did all this technical work, I should get credit for it!” My manager once coached me, “Your stakeholders should be amazed by how simple you made it. Not by how complicated the problem is.”\nThe best example I know of this is Chris Voss, an FBI negotiator. Listen to his podcasts or YouTubes. He’s a humble guy and doesn’t get into the technical stuff. He knows the principles and keeps the explanations simple. He helps you feel smart when you listen to him. He’s one of the best negotiators in the world and if you were having dinner with him you’d think he was a normal guy. This is how data scientists should be.\n\n\nBugs\nThere are two types of bugs in data science: Software bugs and data bugs. You’ll spend 80% of your ramp up time on a project setting up your environment, learning the data, trying to understand the primary keys and logging and unique values, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody cares about how you do any of this (the same way you don’t care about how cereal ends up in your grocery store), but they do care that you do it because it shows that you’re thinking about the right things.\nThey’ll also worry that you’re spending too much time on the wrong thing, so make sure you believe your actions are solving a business purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\nFocus on principles, not technical details.\nGet the simplest, useful solution into production first to start creating value. Then figure out if it’s worth optimizing. If your product gets deprecated in 3 months then the fancy model will be wasted time anyway.\nYour stakeholders should be amazed by how simple you made it. Not by how complicated the problem is.\nIf you can’t explain a trend with a simple bar/line chart, a fancy regression model won’t do.\nStart with the non-technical (basic math) solution. Then see if you can beat the basic math with a fancy model. Evaluate the cost/benefit of the technical solution relative to the dumb version.\nwhen you have a fancy solution, make sure you compare it to the basic solution. Make sure you can beat the solution your teammates come up with. And make sure you carefully lead them from “their” solution to yours. “At first I tried X. X was fine. But X didn’t account for Y. So I built a model M and saw that M out performs X by 10%.”\nJust because you know/use math, doesn’t mean it’s right for the business. Data Scientists can easily be myopic because the work we do is challenging and deep in the weeds.\nYour boss doesn’t care about the nature of the bugs, but you should try to bring first principles to the table so she can cover for you. “I keep hitting this bug in the data. Can we ask/work with Infra team to solve this because it eats my time.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Nephi 9:28↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

If you change your meeting then Motion will adjust when your tasks will get done. Cons: it’s expensive ($20-$35 per month). It’s mobile app is horrid. It didn’t seem like it offered sub tasks and all that. So you really need to trust the algorithm.\n\nIt gets the notion of task-duration right. But if you want to jot down notes of all the next actions you need to take on a project, your up the creek. I’m also not sure how it handles task dependency - if I put in 5 tasks for a project will it know their order? Not sure. Again I’ve never tried this app so take this all with a grain of salt.\nReclaim is another app claiming to do the same thing and offers a free tier. I did as much as set up my account with this.\nPerhaps if I gave these more attention they’d prove their worth. I’ve tried calendaring my todos in the past and it hasn’t been very effective for me. Perhaps these apps would solve it but I think I need a good mobile app.\nAnyway, you can’t beat free and free is working for me on TickTick right now. Also, my calendar is very open generally so I don’t have the same problems a busy manager might have.\nI think these apps would be best for people who have meeting heavy workflows.

    "text": "When I co-started a company several years ago, my founders and I would canvass neighborhoods knocking doors. We’d discuss our ideas for a new product one door at a time. After each conversation, the product took a new form. Eventually, the product took shape and we had a successful kickstarter launch.\nSince that time, I’ve thought about how valuable it was to get information straight from the source.\nAlberto Savoia’s new book, “The Right It”, is re-teaching me this principle. Data beats opinions, he says. In another book I’m reading, “Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments”, the former CEO of Netscape is quoted saying,\n\nIf we have data, let’s go with data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine. - Jim Barksdale\n\nData sourced from your manager, your stakeholder, or your customer are invaluable to help you know if you’re solving their problem. Too often it’s easy to get stuck in the original solution that comes to our mind.\nData from customers directly shape the product. Data sourced at scale from online experiments refine it.\nOpinions from the customer shape the product. Their behavior (captured as data) speaks louder than their words. Frequently, it’s challenging to correlate the two. We’re left to guess why someone actually clicked, bought, churned. It’s a beautiful cycle.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

The attending violinist then scares it away and is praised for protecting the cake.\nTo the reader’s delight, more animals start appearing and the violinist excitedly protects the cake through hilarious misadventure. (My favorite is when he says, “begone beavers!”)\nTwo funny things happen though:\n\nThe guy soon realizes that all these creatures are wedding guests.\nThe guy has such a big nose and he’s allergic to marshmallows, that when he’s offered some cake he sneezes and the cake goes flying.\n\n\n\n\ndodo on a cake\n\n\n\n\nMorale?\n\nWhen you praise someone for doing something good, they do it again and again. → There’s a natural hero inside all of us.\nBut only the first animal was a problem. The beavers were the chefs. So he ends up creating all these problems thinking they’re problems. → In tech, when you fix a bug you then think other things are bugs and go off fixing those too. No, just do the first. Then check in.\nThe irony is that, despite saving the cake, he sneezes and ruins the cake. → Despite all the effort, the greatest protection to the cake was him staying away from it. Sometimes by trying to solve a problem we can make things way worse and create all these problems. (Politics? Create problems by creating solutions to problems that need solutions.)\n\nDon’t mistake a beaver for a dodo.

I’ve recently listened to some bangers that were only 90 seconds long. They left me hanging.\n\n\n\nEnjoy the music while it lasts\n\n\nWhy was my song so short? Because nobody gets paid after 30 seconds.\n\nApple’s decision made artists want to have more interesting 30 seconds in the iTunes Store\nThat evolved into: an artist doesn’t get paid if you don’t listen at least 30 seconds. And they don’t get paid any more if you listen 31 or 900 seconds. In fact, they get paid more if you listen to two songs, 30s a piece.\n\nSpotify, Amazon, YouTube, Apple, etc all pay based on views. They each define views their own way, but they need to negotiate with the labels who already decided to agree to Apple’s 30s schemes in the early 2000’s. They may have different payment schemes, but some have a scheme of “take all revenue, distribute it according to the artist’s share of views.” So if I pay $10/mo for Spotify and don’t use it, my money goes to someone I didn’t listen to.\nSo how do small artists compete? They’ve got to build their following. Proportionally, the major artists (rather, their labels) soak up all the streaming royalties.\nWhat would be more fair is if my $10 went to the artists I actually listened to, as if I bought their music.\nWhy does any of this matter? Algorithms. Optimization. Monetization.\nIncentives drive outcomes. How we designed our music payment incentives altered music forever (try to be super catchy for 30s). Now, with AI, music can be created much faster which will dilute the pool.\nIn the end, one simple decision changed billions of lives. 30s? That’s all you need to get paid.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I once asked someone at the beach to leash their dog, and they slightly rebuked me, “this is a dog friendly beach.” Well, so it is, I thought, grumpily. I complained to a family member about this grumpy dog owner.\nMoods escalate. And negative moods are even more pervasive and contagious than positive ones. They say a disgruntled customer tells more friends and family than happy ones. Why is this?\nIn the “Black Cat” (The Best of Edgar Allen Poe), Poe describes a gruesome tale man who wanted to do evil just for the sake of it. That it’s in his nature. Not because you want to do the thing, but because you want to do a forbidden thing. The same goes the other way, for sure. But I think we trend slightly pessimistic because being an optimist is more beneficial, more rewarding and therefore more difficult.\nA leader once told me when I was managing a team, “They’ll pick up on everything you do or say.” Oddly, I was picking up on what he was saying.\nSo when you lead, lead carefully. Whether in home or work, lead with kindness, compassion, and restraint. Speak three kind words before a negative. Ask to understand before assuming. Lead as a servant. It takes all the effort to overcome negative vibes, and who better equipped than the leader to do it?\nDon’t be Moriarty:\n\n“Why can’t you be more hopeful for a change?”\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "AI\nTesla finally releases FSD v12, its last hope for self-driving | Electrek - 300k rules based system down to a model - you’ll need both: a model and overrides. - Or, you train the model by learning from the scenarios encoded in your 300k rules engine (like DeepMind’s AlphaGo)\nFast Tracking RAG Model Evaluation with Synthetic Data - synthetic data to evaluate RAG responses? - A response is non-deterministic, random - Perhaps do a Levenshtein distance of sorts to evaluate of response is as good as you want? - But isn’t this the same as question-answer pairs and instruction tuning?\nAuto Wiki by Mutable.ai - this proves how powerful AI is. Just add data and watch it churn. - An example of an AI product.\n\n\nCoding\nPython Does Not Fully Deliver OOP Encapsulation Functionalities - I learned how attributes are names in a Python class. As an R programmer, most of these things were never taught to me in school, and I’ve never really needed to know them (until working with software engineers)\n\n\nProduct\nHow Gong builds product - by Lenny Rachitsky - the planning!! &gt; We do not plan monthly or biweekly. Both the engineering leader and I dislike the Scrum methodology. We feel it’s trying to drive urgency via artificial deadlines versus via value to the customer. And by forcing “commitment” to deliverables within a time window, it essentially inhibits on-the-fly trade-offs between content, quality, and timelines. Yet we have internal reviews with the different groups on a monthly basis.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Same with scripture studies.\n\n2023-12-31\n\nWrite every day (Seth Godin style). Many posts will be bad. But higher repetitions means better writing.\nLearn by writing. Synthesis only happens when sharing.\nWrite first, edit later.\nUse writing to actively digest world news. Doomscrolling is futile and anxiety inducing. Writing and synthesizing helps me comparmentalize the world and where I fit into it.\nDevelop an opinion. Strong opinions, weakly held. A ship is better heading in any direction than none at all. An opinion is a direction.\nEvery post is a story. If it’s not a story, it’s not worth reading.\nI am me. I write what’s on my mind. I hope it’s interesting to different people in different ways.\nWrite each post for one real person in my life, based on one real discussion.\nGratitude is healing, produces optimism, and reveals a new way. Give thanks daily. I give thanks, therefore I have.\n\n2022-12-05\n\nAll blogs are wrong, but some are useful (riff on George Box’s quote that all models are wrong)\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Public accountability is the greatest motivator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese goals are correlated with, but not causal to happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey’re anti-sad, but pro-happy comes not from checking off boxes but by building meaningful relationships with God, self, family, and friends.\nWhy do I measure? Because whenever things aren’t going well I often attribute it to a lacking of one of these things. But I don’t keep this checkbox list to make me happy. Happiness is perspective and relationships. Purpose. So why this list? Well, they’re the foundation of a guided, structured, and prosperous life.\n\nStudying scriptures and praying teaches me who I am and what my purpose is here on earth. It also gives me perfect role models to follow (Christ’s example in the scriptures, and God’s influence on me during prayer). What better way to guide your rudder (as Christensen says), than to be influenced by God on a daily basis. They say you’re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Why not make the number 1 person you spend your most valuable time to be God? (I don’t have to spend 5 hours. 5 very meaningful minutes can correct my day.)\nWriting about my study is my little attempt to share God’s light with the world. Imagine what social media would look like if everyone shared an insight from Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Ghandi, Jesus, Mohammad, on a daily basis and how that insight affected their perspective? Be the change you want to see in the world, they say.\nWriting gratitude rewires my brain. It causes me to see things I wouldn’t. Why not just say things I’m grateful for during prayer or a gratitude journal? I dunno. Those things don’t help me for some reason. It always feels forced (I’ve tried it dozens of ways). Somehow, writing in public, gives me a great sense of “I mean it.” Helps me think about that thing. Give it real thought.\nPhysical health. Strength helps my bones. The effects of weight lifting are seen over decades, not months. I need to take better care of my bones. Same with cardio. They both energize today, but they prevent a whole host of bad things tomorrow and beyond. The effects are compounding - in both directions. Physical health also drives me to eat better. Eating better doesn’t cause me to exercise, but exercising caueses me to eat better. Less snacks.\nMeditating helps me train my mind. It’s a moment where I think about something I want to improve on. Less reactivity as a dad to kids misbehaving. More optimism. More appreciation for the body I have, the health I enjoy, the freedom I have in this world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 Goals: Read, hike, pray, meditate, workout, give thanks daily, study scripture daily\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\n\nDeepen my relationship with and connection to God, self, family, and friends.\nEnjoy intellectual growth and historical understanding\nHave fun.\n\n\n\nKPIs\nReading:\n\n52 books. 12 fiction. 12 biographies. 12 business/self help. 4 religious.

    "text": "This post speaks to how I manage spiritual doubts, such as whether God exists. It got me thinking after reading a few religious posts by Rob Hybdman, someone whose professional (data science) work I greatly admire.\nHere’s a summary of some points I try to make here:\n\nHe doesn’t try to convince us to believe Him without a doubt, He asks us to follow him\nPeople who saw Christ didn’t even recognize Him as the Savior\nChristianity is hard to grasp and won’t make total sense when you think deeply about it.\nOur job is to keep learning, and ask Him to teach us about His nature\n\n\n\n\nI think too many people grow up thinking of God in black/white terms and when one, linking piece of the puzzle doesn’t fit or is missing, some throw Him out all together. Here’s my take on why people misrepresent God, and how this can lead to personal doubts of faith in Him and His Son.\n\n\n\nChrist asking his disciples, “Whom say he that I am?”\n\n\n\nAn unknown God\nA certain philosopher named Korihor once reasoned that people should stop paying tithing or following restrictive religious commandments because they’re wasting their time. Here’s his thinking:\n\nYea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, ==by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions== and their ==pretended mysteries==, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, ==offend some unknown being, who they say is God==—a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be. - Alma 30:28\n\nI love this because the argument of whether God exists or if Christ was the Savior is nothing new. (And many people I highly regard and esteem are tackling this “new” issue head on, as many in the world are questioning their faith.) But a lot of the same arguments that have existed continue to exist: why believe?\n…It’s not like anyone’s ever seen God anyway.\nLet’s assume for a minute that they have seen God. They saw His Son, His mortal example, walk the earth (John 5:19).\nWhile with His disciples, Christ himself took a moment to reflect on who people thought he was, and whether people actually recognized Him for who He is:\n\nWhen Jesus came into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, ==Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?== And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. Matthews 16:13-14\n\nPeople had no idea who Christ was even though I’d bet either He or His disciples them His name many times while He was healing them.\nPeople are funny like that.\nConsider your own life. Have you ever misinterpreted a situation, even as it’s being explained to you?\nLet’s consider a magician who does a magic trick for you. She doesn’t show you how it’s done, but she does explain it to you with only words. Since you don’t specifically see how the magic trick is done, perhaps your mind wanders and you doubt what really happened.\nDo you trust the Magician? When He tells you who He is, after healing you, do you believe Him? When an unexplainable coincidence happens in your life, what do you chalk it up to?\n\n“Nah, that’s so highly improbable it must just be luck”… (whatever luck is…)\n\nI can’t imagine how it must have felt for people around Christ to be healed by rubbing mud on their eyes or washing in a river a few times or, or, … I can only honestly believe these people felt absolute wonder to the point of mental disassociation. How else do you mentally cope with being a paralytic your whole life and then you’re able to walk?\nIt’s entirely reasonable, then, that they just figured He must be like the other miracle workers they knew - Elias, John the Baptist, etc. They try to frame Him in their believable mental reference, i.e., “luck”.\n\n\nA strange God\nPerhaps though we can relate to when Paul, a lifelong Non-Christian and Christian persecuter, preached to his fellow Gentiles:\n\n16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. 17 Therefore ==disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews==, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. 18 ==Then certain philosophers== of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, ==What will this babbler say?== other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. Acts 17:16-18\n\nPaul got them. He was once like them: a gentile. An unbeliever. A disbeliever. But he eventually was converted to knowing Christ, and, as such, appeared to seem like a babbler when trying to talk to people who once were like him. They considered him and his teachings strange:\n\n19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, ==May we know what this new doctrine==, whereof thou speakest, is? 20 For ==thou bringest certain strange things to our ears==: we would know therefore what these things mean. Acts 16:19-20\n\nMeeting Christ can be strange.\nUnderstanding him, so too.\n\n\nPutting a box on God\nConsider the question, “why does God let good people suffer?”\n(Other important questions like, “why did God encourage Abraham/Isaac/Israel to be polygamists but Adam not?”, or “why did God restrict the entire earth from receiving his Gospel until after Christ died, commanding His people not to marry or mingle with them but then change his tone ~33 AD?”, are worth similar consideration.)\nIt’s a false dichotomy: if God exists and loves us, He surely wouldn’t let us suffer. If suffering exists, especially of good1 people, God must not then exist.\nConsider all the suffering of innocent children2. The reality of human nature is sufferers vs non sufferers3. Any suffering is painful to bear, and nobody better understands this than Christ himself (D&C 19:16-19).\nThe point is, we can falsely equivocate that because God loves us and He had the power to stop suffering, He should stop it.\nDo you do this with any other relationship? Consider the hypothetical:\n\nFather Joe loves his children. But Joe let his son Bob get hit with a toy by little sister Susie. Joe let Susie suffer. Therefore, Joe acted in an evil and therefore does not exist.\n\nThis line of thinking is absurd to anyone with a brain, let alone to anyone who is a parent. They understand that sufferig is part of life, can be good for teaching, and that it doesn’t mean the parent doesn’t exist. Yet sometimes we wonder if God exists because we’re suffering.\n\n\nConsider alternative viewpoints\nTo be comfortable with unanswered questions from a yet unknown God, we should consider how the question is already answered.\nFor example, did God stop Christ from suffering? No. Did Christ stop himself from suffering on the cross when He had the power to turn water to wine for the thirsty, heal the suffering swordsman’s ear, or even raise Himself from the dead?\nI’m trying to rally around the point: we set up for ourselves false philosophical arguments about who or what God is and should be like when there’s a lot of nuance to be considered.\nIn my view, He’s more of a Magician who “explains but doesn’t show” than one who tries “to convince us about every little thing”. Because it’s quite human to be like “oh, yea that magic trick isn’t cool anymore” once you understand it. And His goal is to invite us to believe His son so that we’ll follow Him. His goal isn’t for us to know everything, though he is willing to teach us a lot. Remember: “ask and ye shall receive”.\n\nAnd now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit…and let us reason together, ==that ye may understand;== D&C 50:10\n\nHe just didn’t say when He’d tell us.\n\n\nWhy he explains but doesn’t try to convince\nWhy do I believe that He likes to explain but not convince? A few ideas:\n\nHe taught people they would get to heaven by eating His flesh (sacrament), and people misunderstood and thought this was a “hard” teaching. They walked no more with him (John 6), but he didn’t run them down to try to bring them back. Why didn’t he?4\nHe was chained by the Romans, spat on, crowned with thorns, and whipped. But instead of showing them signs and wonders He let them abuse Him. Then He forgave them after they nailed Him to the cross multiple times and speared Him in His side and gave Him vinegar to drink (Psalm 69, John 19).\nHe knew He couldn’t convince them. He once healed a withered man’s hands and the Pharisees wanted to destroy Him because he did so on the sabbath (Matthew 12:9-14)5. How too are we like the Pharisees where we say “God shouldn’t be like X!!!” Shouldn’t we instead let God reveal Himself?\n\nThese three clues, among many others, give me perspective on why He’s okay being misunderstood by us.\n\n\nA God of purpose, children of purpose and promise\nWhy does He want us to live by faith? Lots of reasons. But there’s only one I’ll speak to: He’s a God of purpose:\n\n37 And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. 38 And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words. 39 For behold, ==this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man==. - Moses 1:37-39\n\nHis goal is to prepare an environment to teach and challenge us. Our goal should be to learn who, how and why.\nOur purpose should not be to put God in a box or imagine Him black and white. It should be to learn who He is, so He’a no longer an unknown God.\n\nAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. - John 17:3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Good without God?↩︎\nThe world is filled with unjust, seemingly unnecessary suffering. Consider innocent children starving across the world, being bombed in Gaza/raped in Israel, bombed in Ukraine, Yemen, gassed in Germany in the Holocaust, starved in Stalin’s camps, nuked by the United States in Japan, etc, etc, etc. (I sincerely don’t write this easily, nor to make light of the suffering.) all of the suffering is horrible. But it doesn’t for a moment mean God doesn’t exist. It actually affirms His existence, because if evil exists the opposite of evil must too.↩︎\nI don’t mean that in the Marxist political sense, because who’s to declare who’s suffering at any given moment? Is an affluent child born with cancer not a sufferer despite them not being poor?↩︎\nConsider this in a humorous way: Why didn’t He say “oh sorry!! Please come back! I’ve got a quota of disciples to reach and if I don’t have you with me…””↩︎\nI love how instead of engaging with the Pharisees, He “withdrew” from them and “healed them all”, kind of as a divine rebel just saying, “you’re mad about me healing one guy on the Sabbath? Fine, I’ll heal everyone.”↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "The Book of Mormon is the most powerful book I’ve read.\nThis is how I get the most out of the book:\n\nI say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul. 2 Nephi 32.9\n\nI’ve read a lot of self help books. It’s not like that. This is a book that inspires personal revelation and a relationship with Christ and Heavenly Father. I get the most out of it when I have a true desire in my heart:\n\nAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. Moroni 10.4\n\nWhen I read it in a rush, I don’t get much out of it. When I don’t pray before hand, or if I’m not sincere, I don’t really get anything substantive.\nIt’s like texting vs calling a friend. If you’re in a rush, you give a half thought text. But if you’re on a long drive and want to build a relationship, you give the friend a call.\n\n\n\nIf you plant a seed, you need to nourish it\n\n\nThe best insight doesn’t come from the Book of Mormon. It comes from the Holy Ghost. So I can read the book as a literary critique and not see its divinity. But as I read it trying to build a relationship with Heavenly Father, then I feel that relationship grow.\n\nNow, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.

    "text": "The story of the Savior’s birth brings many wonderful concepts to memory and can teach us a lot about what will bring us true joy and happiness in this life.\n\n\n\nThe Christ Child\n\n\nThis is my favorite video of the Christmas story. The most powerful part is the moment when Mary sings a lullaby to Jesus. I remember reading somewhere that this moment was completely impromptu by the actress, and it speaks volumes to the sacredness of the moment where Mary first laid eyes on her beloved son.\n\nSo what does this story give me perspective on at this time of year?\n\nChrist was the rightful, bloodline heir to King David’s throne. He was the King of the Jews. But he never sought authority. He never sought a throne. He instead taught “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s”. He didn’t engage in turf battles. In rebellion. In insurrection. He just wanted people to find happiness in their circumstances by living with lovingkindness in their hearts for their God, their neighbor, and themselves.\nIn his role as a Savior and Judge of the world, he sought to not condemn the sinner trapped in the act of sin. Instead he came to liberate. To forgive. To support.\nIf you believe Christ was the Creator and Savior of the world, consider how He chose to come into the world. He was born in a stable, mucked with animal feces and rotting food scraps, covered with the stench of…a stable. He was rejected of a room in the inn. He was laid in a manger, perhaps a feeding trough. Maybe Mary had help giving birth, maybe she didn’t. He was born generally alone. I wonder if He chose to do his birth this way because nobody can say he had it easy. He didn’t have the special treatment of a King’s birth. No, he was born to an exhausted, weary traveler, likely on the cold hard floor of a dirty barn.\nIf we think about the Savior being the architect of this birth, think about how he planned for angels to show up to shepherds. Not King Herod. The shepherds. He would be the prophesied sacrificial Lamb. He would be the Good Shepherd. Yet these people were perhaps the minimum wage, forgotten ones outside the city gate. Yet these are those who had the privilege to see Him first. And He invited them to come and see. His whole life was an invitation.\nHe also invited the rich wise men. All are invited. He wanted all to see, and he wanted the world to know that He was for everyone regardless their circumstances. And that all of us, whether destitute or traveling with caravans, can bring the gifts of our heart to Him. We don’t need to bring gold. He just wants a “broken heart and contrite spirit.\n\nHow can we apply these things to our life, today?\n\nSeek out the forgotten. The people in our life that seem forgotten. The servants in our life (person on the other end of the customer support line, the checkout person, your supervisor) but even, your best friend who seems to be doing great…\nSeek not riches or wealth. Harod sought these things. Christ sought relationships and truth.\nDon’t seek for power. Christ deserved it. Christ had it. He turned water to wine, cursed a tree, and made a host of men fall over at the sound of his voice. Yet he didn’t touch the Romans.\nSeek to invite. To share. To uplift. Christ made shepherds feel important. He invited them to his crib side. And ” his hand is stretched out still.” (Isaiah 9:12)\n\nHe came like all of us, as a child. But he came to show us how a God would live. And he did.\n\n\n\nThe Christ as a Child, before worshipping Wise men\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Today is fast Sunday, a day when testimonies are shared in church. Here’s my testimony I shared today. Someone had just spoken about moving to a new place and seeing God in their lives, even if it was far away from where they had thought they needed to be. They had moved away from family.\nI was reminded today of why I live where I do. Without going into personal details, as a family we decided it was time to leave the east coast and move west. As I wondered how it might be possible, I was encouraged by my wife to reach out to an old contact on a random spreadsheet I had kept seven years prior when I was first looking for jobs. The guy had since changed jobs from when he had interviewed me, but he referred me to his new company.\nWell, this company was otherwise impossible to get noticed at, even with referrals. Turns out this guy was a lot higher than I had known. It was enough to get me the first interview. Four years later we’re still on the west coast. It’s definitely a better situation for our family in many ways.\n\n\n\nMoving because when we had a desire, the Lord opened the door for us\n\n\nAnd in terms of family, I grew up living far away from cousins. My church congregation became my family. My parents friends became my Sunday school teachers and mentors. My friends at church became my closest confidants and kept me company in living the principles I believed in.\nRecently, this church family helped us with meals, gifts, and emotional warmth. I don’t know what I’d do without belonging to a group of people who care for one another (I know many communities are like this, but I think it’s extra special in a Christian context where everyone wants to help and strengthen each other in kindness. We all try their best.)\nChrist’s design that we have a church is inspired:\n\nThere is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. Ephesians 4.4–6\n\nAnd are we not all family? The spiritual children of Christ and sons and daughters of Heavenly Father.\n\nAnd now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters. … therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ… Mosiah 5.7–8\n\nI testify the Hand of God is real. He leads and guides people to where they need to be gathered. And when we gather together as one body, miracles happen.\n\nI also love this scripture, how Lehi was guided to a “land of promise”.\n\nbehold, I have obtained a land of promise 1 Nephi 5.5\n\nHe wrote “have obtained” while he was struggling for food and water in the desert. He saw ahead to when he’d eventually live in a near rain forest paradise.\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

We want to play.\nI love the third pig because he lets them in.\nAlso, the third pig never had to worry about almost getting eaten. Sure, first two enjoyed their fiddle and dance. But they almost died. The third pig is like the non-prodigal son. The one who stayed home and enjoyed the safety of the home the whole time.\nBe wise. Be forgiving. And yes, we always have a wise elder Brother who will accept us."

It got him in trouble with his boys, as Laman and Lemuel “did murmur in many things against their father, because he was a visionary man” (1 Nephi 2.11).\nLehi’s wife, Sariah, also murmured against him, “she also had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.” (1 Nephi 5.2)\nLehi’s response to this is great:\n\nI know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren. But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness. 1 Nephi 5.4–5\n\nThis response teaches me a few things:\n\nwhen people struggle, they can complain against a good thing and make it a bad thing. “Why do you always have to be such a goodie two shoes?”\nThe response is “if I weren’t such a goodie two shoes I’d be miserable”. Helps remind people of the value of their own biases.\n\nComplaining is a natural part of life.

    "text": "I’m reading the Book of Mormon this year with the Come Follow Me (by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) curriculum. I hope you enjoy as I write something I learn each day.\nI’ll tag things “scripture of the day” for any one-scripture thoughts. If it’s related to the Come Follow Me theme, l’ll add a tag.\n\nMiracles of Christ\nThis scripture caught me eye:\n\nFor behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases. Mosiah 3.5\n\n\n\n\nChrist healing all who come unto him\n\n\nI have seen miracles in my life. I’ve also seen collateral-miracles, which is the miracle that happens when you’re expecting one thing but another thing happens instead.\nI’ve seen someone healed from a Priesthood blessing. I’ve seen someone healed from depression. I’ve seen someone healed from doubt and disbelief. I’ve felt the power of the Holy Ghost in my life.\nI’ve also seen people not healed, left to the struggles we all face, and yet miracles abound.\nSo what is a miracle? Is it an outcome? No. It’s the process of seeing how an event can be changed by God for the benefit of an individual. Occasionally, there are supernatural changes in the natural course of things.\nIf any of these things sounds fanciful to those not of my Church, it’s actually a lot more simple and plain than it sounds. Because “the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.” (1 Kings 19.11–12) For me, seeing a miracle of Christ is perceiving the hand by how he operates.\nSome have a hard time reading the Old Testament because how can a God who brought fire from heaven, parted the seas, gave manna from heaven also be a God who doesn’t do those things today?\nI’d argue the miracles of Christ have risen to the point where he works according to our knowledge and insight. I believe in a Christ who is the source of all truth, and who teaches truth (even scientific) to everyone, regardless of their belief system. Matthew 5.45\nAnd so, the miracles of God today are happening within science. Within tech. He doesn’t have to heal us by God’s power if he gave us medicine to do the same.\nHe also doesn’t show his miracles the same way. The people of the Old Testament were simple. They needed signs. But signs aren’t faith, and I believe these days before His second coming are days of greater faith. Days where we’ll have fewer signs.\n\nTherefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe. Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe. 18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it. Alma 32.16–18\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Book of Mormon had 12 witnesses of its divinity - the three spiritual testimonies by the Three Witnesses, the Eight Witnesses with a physical witness, and Joseph Smith, the one who translated it as prophet, seer, and revelator. Powerfully, all Three Witnesses left the church years later (1937/38) nearly 8-9 years after writing their testimony (1829), but never left their testimonies:\n\nDespite differences with Joseph Smith that led each of the Three Witnesses to part ways individually with the Church (Cowdery and Harris later returned), they continued to affirm their testimony as witnesses throughout their lives. Witnesses of the Book of Mormon\n\n\nWhen a loved one leaves their testimony\nLet’s consider the world where these three denied their testimonies. (It’s easy to see that they “never doubted their own witness, therefore it must be true”.) But I think this is a sandy foundation because a thing should be true regardless of what three individuals say about it.\n\n\n\nWhat if one had forsaken their testimony - would you still believe he saw it?\n\n\nThose who believe in Christ hold strong beliefs in Him, and it must be a belief because they cannot see Him. They rely on the faith built on personal witness and also built by the testimony of others. But what do you do when a loved one abandons their testimony, or becomes an unbeliever? Do you doubt everything you learned from them? Perhaps.\nWho do you trust - the “them” now that un-believes, or the “them” then that once believed?\nConsider a hard-and-fast alternative: what if someone began doubting the existence of gravity? What if they were once your physics professor? Easy: you just go to the apple tree and demonstrate the principle by dropping an apple. “No, that’s magnetism”, the professor now claims.\nYou’re kind of stuck: well, if you think it’s magnetism, there’s not much I can do - this concept is called gravity. Similarly, people leave God’s path and believe the Hand of God that acts in their live is now, and always has been, just coincidence, luck, etc. what else could it be?\nBut what is coincidence? Luck? (I ponder these things often as a statistician. For another time…)\n\n\nPutting a name on a Concept\nThere’s precedence for this - when Ammon appeared to the Lamanites, they thought he acted by the Great Spirit. Instead of telling them they were wrong, he instead clarified, “that great spirit is God”.\n\n26 And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great Spirit? 27 And he said, Yea. 28 And Ammon said: This is God. And Ammon said unto him again: Believest thou that this Great Spirit, who is God, created all things which are in heaven and in the earth?\nAlma 18.26–28\n\nLikewise, when unbelievers doubt the Hand of God, or re-cast their old ways according to a new belief framework, perhaps they’re just labeling a concept in a different way. (It’s also really hard to know what someone once considered “God” vs not in their life, so take this point with a grain of salt.)\nAfter all, when people leave God some claim they were under confirmation bias, the concept that you favor the evidence that supports your belief. Hyndman argues confirmation bias can go both ways, for believers and unbelievers, but does claim that evidence favors the skeptics because there should be evidence. I’d argue he relies solely on physical evidence. There is spiritual evidence to be considered. Spiritual evidence is what we believe in. It’s what the Three Witnesses relied on. It’s unprovable to anyone else, and only receivable by the Holy Ghost. If God exists, let Him reveal himself. Let Him prevail:\n\nBut whom say ye that I am? 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\nMatthew 16.15–17\n\nThe most powerful thing about being a Christian is that it cannot be proven Christ didn’t exist or walk the earth. Even if you falsify the entire bible, erase history, or discover that “Mary” was an invented concept by some creed or counsel bound to oppress us - there’s still a question: did the Man exist? We can debate it. Pharisees debated if He was That Messiah. Nobody now can know, except God reveals it to them.\nWhy? Because to claim God doesn’t exist, or the plates weren’t real, you’d also have to have evidence. Counter-evidence isn’t evidence. Lack of evidence likewise. Don’t we continually find new fossils? New animals in the wild? Lack of evidence doesn’t mean they don’t exist.1\nTo prove the Abrahamic God doesn’t exist people just say “well I found all this stuff about the bible, about church leaders, etc” was wrong or misconstrued. So? First, we have to make sure the “new stuff” learned is actually true (could be a lie), but if it is true (that something you once believed is a lie or misunderstanding) we must find out how this fits into Christ’s bigger picture.2\nYou can’t claim that Joseph Smith didn’t see God and that the Three Witnesses didn’t see the plates at some point. Because you weren’t there in 1829. Even if they had later denied, from reading Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, it’s quite clear how people can be manipulated in the courts of law, influenced by money, influenced by their own delusions, etc. Since delusions go both ways, relying on people at all isn’t how we learn the existence of a Divine. Peter learned of Christ’s divinity the way we all must (quote above). Show me the evidence, says the scientist in me: the spiritual evidence. # Flip Floppers on Both Sides\nFloppers flip both ways. The quote above said another way: who’s witness do you trust - the you of today, the you of yesterday, or the you of tomorrow? We can all come and go with our testimonies. This is life. We must have an unalterable way to learn truth, one independent of our path.\nWe’ve got the Paul’s of the world who were once Christian persecutors who flip to believers, and we’ve got those who claimed Joseph Smith was a fallen prophet after being in vision with him.\nWe’re all more like Laman and Lemuel than we realize. We see things that make us believe, we come to God, and then we forget and wonder if they never happened.\nWe’re all flip floppers. Let us not seek truth alone from others, or even rely solely on the Prophet. Our testimonies must be on Christ, and learning truth by the Holy Ghost, who will then guide us to understand the words of prophets and imperfect leaders. It’s good science.\n\nIn coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.\n“Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives”, Russell M. Nelson\n\nI’m glad the Three Witnesses never denied their testimonies, but I’m glad there’s a way to know the Book of Mormon is true without them. After all, those dudes didn’t answer my prayer about the book’s truth. Heavenly Father did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other side may say (as Hyndman) does), I might as well believe in the Tooth Fairy, or Santa, because I don’t have evidence they don’t exist. Fair. Then belief is a choice, and must follow the principle of “by their fruits ye shall know them”. Did Baal call down Fire? No, only Elijah’s God. “Was that story of the Bible invented?” Perhaps. If so, explain why living Christ’s gospel brings me joy? “Because they’re good principles”, well, what is good, if not God? “Well then why not Zeus, or Baal to be your God?”, because I believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - not the God of Baal. I believe the scriptures because they teach good things. “What about the misogyny, racism, war and killing in the Bible etc etc etc”, well, perhaps some was commanded by God for reasons and context we don’t have. Perhaps some of the Bible isn’t truely written. “If some isn’t true it’s all not true because parts of it say it’s all true”. Well, what’s true is true, what’s not isn’t. “Who’s to say what God inspired?” Well, who’s to say what’s not inspired? Only God. “We’re not getting anywhere”. Ahh, but we are. Because I believe in God, and after believing Him I exercised faith in His son to pray on His name and open myself to trying to follow His ways. I’m far from perfect, but once I did this, I received spiritual knowledge, and having seen more of the Hand of God in my life, I can say there are miracles of events I can’t explain by chance or delusion alone. Miracles only a loving God could produce. This is my knowledge, which follows faith. Alma 32.34–36 And we also have the Book of Mormon, which is a powerful second witness of Christ that brought reality to the truth in the Bible, and continually helps me feel the fruits of the Spirit, which is the Holy Ghost telling me it’s true.↩︎\nmy whole life until 21 I had no idea Joseph Smith had so many (up to 42) wives. “Some say he was a womanizer, pimp, etc”. Perhaps. But perhaps he was a prophet commanded to do so. Were we there? God at one point commanded Abraham to raise seed and have many wives. “Maybe Abraham was a philanderer too.” Okay, but does that definition of chastity and virtue not depend on the very construction of marriage as ordained by God who married Adam and Eve as husband and wife? If it’s from God, it’s His law, and He chose the rules. “But Joseph altered the rules and made stuff up so he could get with women and teenagers.” Perhaps. That assumes we know him, he told us that, and he believed it to be true. So we’ll leave it as an opinion. In my opinion he followed a commandment from an Angel, despite me not understanding it entirely or being comfortable with the idea. Let the man speak for himself.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

He knew it was time (John 13:26-27), even if nobody else could comprehend.\nBut remember what happened after? He resurrected. He brought His light back to His friends.\nPerhaps New Year’s lights can remind us of His return. And perhaps a New Year’s resolution can remind us that He invited His disciples to change their ways and go and preach to the gentiles (people previously not allowed to have His gospel and His gift of baptism and the Holy Ghost), to share the gift of Christ(mas) with everyone.\nThe death of Christ marked the fulfillment of prophecy and the fulfillment of the Law of Moses, which meant that the Jews and the house of Israel were no longer the only ones chosen by God but now everybody could receive the gospel (Galatians 3:29).\nLet’s take this new year to remember all are loved.

Muggeridge wrote, “I had a notion that somehow, besides questing, I was being pursued.” Lewis said that, “…night after night…I sensed the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet.

(The Dove (Forevermore)) It won’t last. it’s endearing.\nNo, this isn’t just fanciful thinking - this is a choice. You’ve chosen to be angry at that spilled milk, lost your cool when bro slapped sis, and walked out of the room when you heard that last cry for “more breakfast!!”.\nBut why did you get overwhelmed? Stressed about all there is to do, and now there’s one more thing? Stressed about “am i a good parent”? Stressed about raising your kids right and you have to instruct them on everything they do wrong in order to do that?\nMy new philosophy: Kids are kids. They’re optimizers. Anyone in tech knows that an optimizer is a thing trying to find the optimal point of another thing. It’s like battleships - you keep guessing until you find. Then you guess around until you get all the points, until you know where to look.\nKids do this all day. They say something crazy trying to get a reaction. They say a not-funny joke 100 times until it’s funny again. Humans do that too.\nSo they’re optimizing. Exploring. Exploiting. That’s all their doing - exploring the space, exploiting the emotional signal.\nKnowing that, find the fun in the moment. They won’t always be like this. And when it’s gone, you’ll wish it wasn’t.

    "text": "1 Nephi 7\nThis exchange is fascinating:\n\nNow behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them. And now, if ye have choice, go up to the land, and remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.\n\nLaman and Lemuel don’t want to be in the wilderness, but when Nephi tells them they have their agency, they’re not brave enough to go back to Jerusalem.\nIn other words, he catches them in their rouse. “Nobody’s forcing you”, go back if you want, but if you do you’ll remember that you’re going to die there.\nHow often do we like to complain about something but not actually do anything about it? Reminds me of the quote “So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” (Revelation 3.16)\nIf you don’t want to do anything about it, don’t complain. Vote with your feet, not your mouth. (They were voting with their feet to leave Jerusalem but voting with their mounts against it.)\n\n\n\nIf you’re gonna walk, walk. If you’re gonna follow the prophet, follow.\n\n\n\n\n16 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to pass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they sought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts. 1 Nephi 7.15–16\n\nAlso interesting is how they didn’t directly want to kill Nephi (didn’t have the courage here to try), but instead just decided to leave him to die (Joseph of Egypt style).\nThis is one of those “I’m not actually sinning because I didn’t do the sin” things. Tying someone up isn’t killing them. Should they die, that’s an unfortunate derivative consequence. But we didn’t kill him. 1\nBacking up to a higher point: how often do we skirt the issue and not take full accountability? They can’t go back to Jerusalem and they can’t even properly attempt murder. They’re just lazy and without conviction all around.\nBut so are we. We all have these tendencies to disassociate from accountability for our life:\n\nwell X person is annoying. “Are you going to talk to them?” No…\nEtc…\n\nOwn up. # Other Verses of Interest\nToday I liked these verses:\n\nWherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto those who are not of the world. 1 Nephi 6.5\n\nAm I someone who is not of this world? Fascinating question because it makes me wonder what is “the world”. What was Nephibtrying to define here? Perhaps he was summarizing in his own way that those who have their head in the spiritual clouds will love these things, while those who live by “the world” won’t. It’s also reflective of his experience trying to share the gospel that some people don’t care. They just want to enjoy the pineapples and what not. Am I distracted by money, fame, greed, envy?\n\nI also got a little ahead and listened to this scripture:\n\nFor it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot. 1 Nephi 11.1\n\nMy kids love to come up to my phone and say “let me see!!!” If they hear audio in another room they come sprinting.\nWhy do kids love seeing? They want to see. They’re sponges. They’re also without much experience in life so they want to see it all! Make up for lost time…\nTo become like a little child is to want to see for ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were living the Old law. Perhaps this was legal. But the law of the heart says: this is attempted murder.↩︎\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

    "text": "Lehi had a humbling experience as he was complaining at how hard the journey was:\n\nAnd it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow. 1 Nephi 16.25\n\nWhen the Lord chastened Lehi, he pointed Lehi to the Liahona for next steps:\n\nAnd it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written. 1 Nephi 16.26\n\nThe Lord was already speaking to Lehi, so why did he tell Lehi to look at the Liahona? Why not just tell him what next to do?\nAn interesting thing happened with the Brother of Jared as well:\n\nAnd it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord. Ether 2.14\n\n\n\n\nChrist standing with the Brother of Jared in a cloud\n\n\nIn this case, the Lord just told him the next steps: “Go to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built.” (Ether 2.16)\nWhy did Lehi get a compass, and the Jaredites not? Why did the Lord point Lehi to get his answers from the compass, but just told brother of Jared what next to do?\nWell, I’m sure it’s not so black and white. But the fact that there is a black and a white way in which the Lord teaches us is my point.\nSometimes the Lord tells us what to do (black). Sometimes he reminds us of the things he’s already given us (white). He reminds us of words from the scriptures. He reminds us of past prayers. He reminds us to pray.\nAnd if we look more closely, we actually do see a similarity between Brother of Jared and Lehi because they “built barges after the manner which they had built, according to the instructions of the Lord.” (Ether 2.16)\nMeaning: they already had the answer and the Lord just had to remind them.\nMeaning: their liahona was the fact that they already had directions from the Lord.\nLet’s go back a little. Earlier in Jaredite journey, they were being very deliberately lead by the Lord:\n\nAnd it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions whither they should travel. Ether 2.5\n\nNot only that, but the Lord gave them instructions on how to build a barge:\n\nAnd it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and did build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord. Ether 2.6\n\nSo Lehi and Brother of Jared were both pointed in the direction they should go. But the Lord teaches them each in their own way. For Lehi he gives him a Liahona and tells him to read the words therein. This is a physical tool, kind of like the Book of Mormon and other scripture. We should not be surprised if sometimes the Lord tells us “go to the scriptures, I will answer your question there” or “listen to general conference”. The Lord often points us to places where He’ll speak to us, giving us opportunities to show our faith and do our part.\nOn the other hand, sometimes he may guide us by the hand and show us the way to go. He may directly just tell us to go one way. This is another way of His for interacting with us.\nAnd interestingly, he later told brother of Jared “remember those barges I gave you four years ago? Rebuild more.” He didn’t necessarily give them more designs but reminded the Jaredites of how he had already guided them.\n\n\n\nBrother of Jared and the Lord\n\n\nThere is power in remembering the things the Lord has already done for us. We shouldn’t always seek new signs. We should seek to remember. And in remembering, we’re lead anew.\n\nWhat I Learned\n\nThe Lord guides the same person in different ways\nHe guides two people in the same circumstance in different ways\nHe asks us to remember\nIf we’ve embarked on the journey, even if we stumble, he’ll lovingly chastise us to remember the Way\n\n\n\nMeaning\nI take solice in that He wants to guide me personally. He may ask me to read my scriptures. He may remind me of a past time. He may give me specific instructions. He may just expect me to walk or build and do the thing I’m supposed to do. Keep going until you receive further instruction.\nHe’s also actually heavily involved in the details it seems. We may wander lost (Israelites) or be caught relaxing for four years on the beach (Jaredites), but He’s still very heavily involved. I can trust He loves me and wants to guide me.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

Consider the Angel’s instruction:\n\n7 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God. 1 Nephi 11.7\n\nNow, we know that the Lord rebuked the Pharisees for seeking signs:\n\nThe Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. Matthew 16.1–4\n\nBut signs themselves are good. Moses lead by signs: the seven miracles. Baal was trumped by a sign: fire from heaven. Manna in the wilderness. Water from the rock. The fall of the city from trumpets. Oil in the vial.\nAny miracle is a sign. A sign that God exists. That He has all power. That Christ is His son.\nBut today we don’t need to seek for new signs but instead do as the Lord said and “discern the signs of the times”.\nBy seeking to see His hand, we find the signs.\nIt’s wicked to seek for a sign, because wicked means “unrepentant”. An unrepentant soul, one who is not going to Heavenly Father and seeking His love, doesn’t see the Hand of God in their life. As a result, they are without his signs (Gratus sum, ergo habeo).\nSo to see signs:\n\nRepent (desire a connection with Heavenly Father and His son)\nLook for them (discern)\n\nPresto poof.\n\n\n\nWhy would I believe a new sign if I don’t believe the old signs?\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

I remember two distinct moments hallucinating that the room was splitting and shifting and another when bees were covering the corner of my bunk. The delirium was real.\nEventually it went away. But there was also a doctor there each time I got sick. One for me, to take my blood. One for my mom, to try to comfort and counsel her.\nI’m grateful for doctors of the mind who help alleviate sicknesses of stress, anxiety, depression, etc. I know more people with some type of recurring emotional distress than I know without. I see the benefits reaped by those who seek emotional healing through therapy. I’m proud of the friends who struggle, but who don’t struggle alone. The only way out, is with.\nI’m grateful for healers of the soul. Christ invited everyone to change their ways by letting go of the things that didn’t bring them true happiness, and focus on the things that do. In one invitation, he urged us to come unto him “that I may heal you”. I’ve witnessed spiritual healing through prayer, which is the process of going from feeling forgotten to then knowing I am a child of God and he has a plan for me.\n\n\nHe Came to Heal\nThis to me is the meaning of Christmas: healing. Freedom from bruised bodies, broken minds, or hurting hearts. He came to be broken, so that we may be healed.\n\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. Isaiah 53:5\n\n\nHe will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities. Alma 7:12\n\nNot all healing happens in an instant, and sometimes some things don’t fully heal or heal at all. But I’m grateful healing is possible and there are doctors in the constant pursuit of it. And I’m grateful for friends who have, at times, helped heal me in all these ways.\nMost of us won’t be known as doctors. But all of us try the best we can to help heal our loved ones, such as healing a child with a band aid, a spouse with a hug, a friend with a lunch.

The bottom belay would catch me.\nI held the rope tightly in my hand as I looked off into the Appalachian mountains and the green trees dotting my surroundings. I looked ahead at the rock face, and up at the cliff hang. I held that rope for a second more before…drop.\nAnd I fell, as planned! It was insane and it took all of half a second.\nBut then something unexpected happened: the first belay rope wrapped around my right leg. I turned upside down and instead of the belay stopping me, the burning of rope wrapped around my leg halted my descent. Didn’t feel good.\nI’m grateful I didn’t die that day. That rope could have wrapped my neck. It’s possible I could have not stopped for some reason. It’s possible those guys who were my guides that day didn’t actually know what they were doing and it wasn’t as safe as they said.\nThat feeling of dropping was incredible though, as you never feel so heavy as when your hurtling towards the ground at gravitational constant acceleration.\nI had many great experiences since then rock climbing, though I don’t go often.

If they show up to play basketball they want to be told they’re good at basketball. If they work on a task for you, it’s because they want to be told they’re good at that task.

Poe got it all wrong.\nIf you haven’t read “The Raven” recently, take a moment first to remember, remember that Raven of yore.\n\nThe Dove (Forevermore)\nA twist on “The Raven” by Bryan Whiting\nThree A.M., I hear you wrapping.\nDesitin, I keep slapping.\nDiapers fresh, for poop, post napping.\nDiapers fresh, for my Adore.\n\nIt was a cold and bleak December.\nDark and dreary, I remember.\nSleepless nights and occasional frights,    \nI'd forgotten the parent's implore:\n  please protect my Sweet Adore   \n\nNothing strange, just parents living.\nBabies growing, always swimming\nthrough the tides of life they're dipping,    \n  dripping, \n    tripping, slick socks \n        slipping    \n    lovey, pants, they all keep ripping    \n\"Will it stop?\", my mind is tipping\nI love them so, my Adore.   \nBut I just ask rest, I implore.    \nWill I get it? \n  \"Nevermore.\"    \n\nWhat's that I hear, is something slapping?    \nNo! by Jove! A creature crapping!    \nCrapping on my kitchen floor!! \nRight next to the. bathroom..door...\nI just cannot believe for sure.\nNot another chore.\nI just mopped there, I can assure.\nI feel denial swelling more.\n  That creature must be \n    her \n  Adore.  \n\nThen in Jan the rain starts stalling.  \nOn my chest, her eyes are falling,  \nNapping, cooing, smiling, fawning,\nMy bedroom window, in Jan is calling\nCalling in a creature, sure.\n\n\"What's this?\" I wonder, as I slumber.\nIs it just me, or am I dumber?    \nIs that a bird?! What's that number? \n\"Animal control!\" I now thunder,\n\"For the dove! Not one mess more!!\"\n\"Begone, you bird!\" I implore!\nIt cocks its head, \n  \"Nevermore.\"\n\nSomething changed, as I remember,\nafter that, cold, bleak December.\nThe sleep rolled in, and so I weather,\n  weather just a little bit more.\n\nThe baby's coos I now see freshly.\nThe piqued smiles now enmesh me.\nThe drools of milk now refresh me.\n\"Refresh me, my Adore.\"\nHow could I ever\n  have seen anything more?\n    Please don't let it end, I implore.\nThe dove then whispers, \n  \"Evermore.\"\n\nThe children calling, wailing, falling\nat my feet, screaming, brawling,\nincessant thumping, pounding, hounding,\n  is pleasant to my ears once more.\nPleasant because they're my Adore.\n\nI see it now, that bright December.\nIt wasn't dark, I now remember.\nJust a dog, a fog, but nothing more. \nBut now it's gone, and nevermore.\nI took photos, Polaroids, sure.\nBut now it's gone. \n  And I want more. \n\nRemembered now are the cuddles.\nLong forgotten: spilled milk puddles.\nSpilled milk puddles are \n  nevermore. \n\nDays asleep and nights awake.\nDream eyes open, for goodness sake.\nWhat I wouldn't give to take\nanother look at my Make.\nAnother look at \n    my \n  Adore.\n\nWhen I could hold her, and nothing more. \nWhen in my hands, and on the floor\nwe cuddle, huddle, muddle more.\n\"Bring it back\", I implore\n\"Turn back time\", I plead pure.\n\nThen entered in that dove once more, \nthe welcomed bird, the dove of yore.\n\"The past is gone, time pressed its seal.\nBut yours to keep, for it is real\npast and present, space time is traveled\nIn eternity, your gift unravels\n  Forevermore.\"\nThe tides of parenting are just phases. The good, the bad, the guilt, the love, the denial you even have kids to the overwhelming joy you could never express adequately in words…it all comes and goes - sometimes within the same hour.\nThen suddenly we realize it’s all gone before we can blink.\nThe newborn is now walking at my feet. The eighteeen-month-old-diaper-generator is now riding his bike. The four-year-old brother slapper is now six and creating “Daddy, I love you” cards. Thankfully families are forevermore.\n(Mostly) written 5:02am on Jan 5, 2024, after a sweet midnight feeding, where she cooed and smiled right before passing out peacefully on my chest.\n\n\n\nMessy rooms, a memory forevermore\n\n\nOther lines…\nPints of puke are never more\nOnce held lovey is now a bore\nonce scraped knees now never sore\ngoing to the park now a chore\n\n\n\n\n_________________________   Bryan lives somewhere at the intersection of faith, fatherhood, and futurism and writes about tech, books, Christianity, gratitude, and whatever’s on his mind.

# Scriptures

> For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.
> [2 Nephi 31.3](../scriptures/2-nephi-31.3)

# Meaning

The Lord keeps things simple. He does not embellish. He does not try to convince. He just convinces. He does His work.

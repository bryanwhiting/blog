  <title>The Sun Also Rises</title>
  <dc:creator>Ernest Hemingway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/the-sun-also-rises.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The story is one of Brett and her influence on a group of men. Jake, whom she doesn’t want to be with because of an injury, Robert Cohn, who wanted to treat her well, then Mike who is a count, bankrupt, and a Lord with access to money, and Bill, who doesn’t interact with Brett much.</p>
<p>Then Brett runs away with Pedro.</p>
<p>She can’t help herself. She ends up back in Jake’s arms, asking him for help when she could have asked Mike. She settles on Mike.</p>
<p>She lives without morals - floating with the sea. Jake is an observer.</p>
<p>Personal impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>the dialogue is captivating. Calming in a sense. Meditative. Simple.</li>
<li>On its surface all that happens is chats at bars, a bull fight, and a lot of drinking.</li>
<li>They all want something more, and end up fighting each other for it. None</li>
<li>All the characters are predictable. Their arcs hardly evolve. They just meander. And perhaps that’s the point. It’s the lost generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-26</p>
<ul>
<li>hemingway’s writing is so calming.</li>
<li><a href="../creative/prose-nuzzle.html">Nuzzle</a> was written as inspiration…</li>

  <title>Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team</title>

<p>What did I take away from this?</p>
<ul>
<li>No all groups are teams</li>
<li>Teams are 5-12</li>
<li>Too many means advocacy overrules inquiry in decision making</li>
<li>Leaders want to rule their tribes, but they need to recognize they’re part of the leadership team.</li>
<li>Teams have an objective.</li>
<li>Sometimes cutting one person out can immediately improve the team, but often most people need to be challenged or coached. Most will rise to the occasion. This is a long-held personal principle: don’t fire. Focus on where that person can thrive. Try three places. Then if it’s not working out or they’re resisting, then fire.</li>
<li>Be vulnerable, not too much</li>
<li>Team bonding isn’t socializing. Team cohesion is doing the hardest work possible: grappling with honesty, candidness, and coming out on top.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-20</p>
<ul>
<li>commitment clarity
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cascading communication
<ul>
<li>Communicate within 24 hours</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Advocacy vs inquiry.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-19</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Absence of trust</li>
<li>Fear of conflict</li>
<li>Lack of commitment</li>
<li>Avoidance of accountability</li>
<li>Inattention to results</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>we often attribute a leader’s dysfunctions to a xharacter flaw (internal) but attribute our own dysfunctions to situstional things (external) and attribute someone’s success to external (luck) but our own success to internal (good at something)</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/daring-greatly.html">Daring Greatly</a> and <a href="../book-review/dare-to-lead.html">Dare to Lead</a> both talk about the power of vulnerability. This guy talks about how vulnerability breeds trust.</li>

<p>Reminds me of <a href="../book-review/atomic-habits.html">Atomic Habits</a> in its clarity and power.</p>
<p>2024-02-19</p>
<p>One-liner:</p>
<ul>
<li>character. Problem. The plan. The solution
<ul>
<li>We help small business leaders navigate the uncertainties in today’s economy by delivering and implementing customized AI strategies that modernize their business.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-18</p>
<ul>
<li>what’s at stake
<ul>
<li>Loss aversion.</li>
<li>Create vulnerability</li>
<li>Specific call to action to resolve the risk.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transitional call to action: give something away for free. → establish yourself as a leader. Reciprocity. Give more away for free. They’ll want to buy your workshop. <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a></li>
<li>Three story endings
<ul>
<li>Win power or possession</li>
<li>Be unified with someone or something that makes them whole</li>
<li>experience Some self realization that makes them whole</li>
</ul></li>
<li>give them an <strong>aspirational identity</strong> and help them step into it. Identity transformation.
<ul>
<li>The guide helps them identify their transformation. Help them set themselves apart.</li>
<li>Identity transformation: from X to Y.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The only point of the site is to convert.</li>
<li>In machine learning, who is the hero? Is it the model? Who is the guide? Me? My boss is the hero. The model is the guide?
<ul>
<li>I think the model is the hero. I’m the guide to help it achieve its potential. Aspirational identity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>5 marketing

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-17</p>
<ul>
<li>customers don’t care about your brand. They’re the hero. Similar to <a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> - “you?!? what about <em>me</em> you inconsiderate donkey”</li>
<li>Clarity. We crave clarity.</li>
<li>Audience needs to know:
<ul>
<li>Who is the hero</li>
<li>what the hero wants</li>
<li>who/What the hero has to defeat to get what they want</li>
<li>What horrible thing will happen if they don’t win, and what wonderful thing will happen if they do win.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Marketing
<ul>
<li>What does our customer want?</li>
<li>What problem we’re helping them solve</li>
<li>What life will look like after they engage our product and services</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you confuse, you lose. J</li>
<li>7 points
<ul>
<li>A character who wants something</li>
<li>encounters a problem before they can get it</li>
<li>At the peak of their despair,</li>
<li>a guide enters their life and gives them a plan and</li>
<li>calls them to action</li>
<li>That action helps them avoid failure and end in success</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Survival need
<ul>
<li>Create a story gap</li>
<li>Where will this brand take you</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The villain - dastardly
<ul>
<li>villain is a root source. Not a feeling. The thing that caused the villain.</li>
<li>Villain is relatable</li>
<li>Singular. One villain is enough.</li>
<li>Villain is real.</li>
<li>What product does your defeat?</li>

<li>Apple: we solve customer frustration and intimidation</li>
<li>External: we paint your home.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>External, internal, and philosophical problem
<ul>
<li>Luke needs to blow up Death Star (external) because he doesn’t feel like he’s good enough (internal) and he needs to defeat the evil empire (philosophical)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Process plan: how they use your product</li>
<li>Agreement plan.</li>
<li>Call to action: ask them.
<ul>
<li>Buy now.</li>
<li>Chat with Bryan</li>
<li>Do you believe in your product? Brands need to offer solutions, not charity.</li>

</ul>
<p>Silvermine AI:</p>

<li>ended how it should have. Total absolution. What a story.</li>
<li>Things I liked: the warring perspectives of how to survive, the question of what is law and order when nothing is going on, the dangers men will go to, the antics nations will rage for a fraction of the return on investment (ansombs’ bounty was a fraction of what was paid for the voyage.). The kweskar are incredible. The four different return voyages home.</li>

<p>The Scottish man you’re referring to is Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean, now known as Robinson Crusoe Island, part of the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile. Selkirk lived alone on the island from 1704 to 1709. His story is believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe’s novel “Robinson Crusoe.” Selkirk was a skilled navigator and sailor, and his survival skills, including hunting, gathering, and shelter building, allowed him to survive until he was eventually rescued by an English ship. His experience highlights the human capacity for adaptation and survival in extreme conditions.</p>

<li>thank goodness they’re not as intelligent as those who kill them, though they’re more noble and able</li>
<li>Let him believe I am more man than I AM and I will be so</li>
<li>“The thousand times he had proved it didn’t matter now. He needs to prove it again anew that he’s a man”</li>

<p>Storytelling</p>
<ul>
<li>I love how he speaks a thought, then follows up with reality. Like “come on, catch the hook” “but the hook did not catch”</li>
<li>Repetitive words used in new ways evoke new meaning</li>
<li>Keep it simple. <a href="../posts/mark-cuban-mogul-support.html">Mark Cuban Mogul Support</a> - don’t use a big word when a simpler one will do. He evokes strong emotion without much fanciful language.</li>
<li>Your mind fills in the blanks. He encodes the intuition of 50 years of fishing in plain words. “I’ve got enough line…” is not a calculation. <a href="../book-review/wool.html">Wool</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> are much more</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-01 - first you borrow.

  <title>Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</title>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>complements go a long way. Spread good rumors.</li>
<li>Find similarities.</li>
<li>You gain back more than what you give. So give more.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-13</p>
<ul>
<li>people are more likely to be influenced by and ad when they don’t think it’s an ad</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-10</p>
<ul>
<li>Rejection and retreat principle. Larger than smaller offers.</li>
<li>Contrast principle.</li>
<li>Reciprocity - people give more than they get out of a sense of burden.</li>
<li>Reciprocity - your good works are not lost if they’re felt sincere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Liking:</p>
<ul>
<li>“it’s impossible to change someone’s belief with reasoning when they didn’t use reasoning and logic to come to that belief in the first place”</li>
<li>“You cannot reason a person out a position he did not reason himself into in the first place” - Jonathan Swift #quotes</li>
<li>Liking: finding genuine similarities between you and the other.</li>
<li>In group vs out group</li>
<li>Assigning labels, such as mascots or alter names</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-01-30</p>
<ul>
<li>Ackerman method from <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> applies to the concept of anchoring. Better to anchor at $2 then tell them $200 off than play a joke at $10000 but only offer $200.</li>
<li>Reciprocity - the small things compound over time. Give more than you expect to get.</li>
<li>“Because”. Giving reasons is persuasive, that word is a trigger.</li>
</ul>

<p>Summmary: - very similar to <a href="../book-review/1984.html">1984</a>. Little communication. Mind control. - His writing style is unique: kill people just after they’re created. And the mindset right before they die is fascinating. “The cool of the grate, slippery” - someone’s last thoughts. - Psychology of leadership.</p>
<p>2024-01-25 - guess: they poison the people in the suits.</p>

<li>Don’t covet thy own property → the Lord gives. He may recall for His purposes.</li>
<li>Land of promise to the saints → riches. Seek with all heart. many lands of promise. Missouri? Utah?</li>

<li>“Attend to it” - Joseph Senior supported Joseph. The Angel wanted Joseph to know this.</li>
<li>David’s field being ploughed overnight - a few items were left for David - the Lord did just enough. Also, the Lord honored the man’s request and didn’t disrespect him. The man got what he wanted, David did some more work, and the unnecessary part was finished by whomever.</li>

<p>2024-01-22 - father poem. Father forgets. - bate the hook to please the fish - Tell them what they want - And how to get it - Lavish with praise. This is greater incentive than any criticism - What do they want? (Not what do I want?) “smoking will keep you from making the bball team” - Ford: put yourself in their position. Consider it. And consider your own - Consider how they’ll receive your email. They have a ton of problems. They’re overwhelmed. Don’t sell them. Teach them the benefits they’ll get. - Flattery vs appreciation - flattery is lip service. If you’re trying to convince someone to do something and you’re using flattery, then thats manipulation.

<p>I was reading the wrong book. I read <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> when my friends recommended <em>this</em> one instead.</p>
<p>I already like this one better. It lays things out better i feel. More chronological. But perhaps it’s because he has more time to write it.</p>

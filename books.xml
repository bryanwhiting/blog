<ul>
<li>thank goodness they’re not as intelligent as those who kill them, though they’re more noble and able</li>
<li>Let him believe I am more man than I AM and I will be so</li>
<li>“The thousand times he had proved it didn’t matter now. He needs to prove it again anew that he’s a man”</li>
<li>Boy: “I have so much to learn from you” - after the boy has just gotten “lucky”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Storytelling</p>
<ul>
<li>I love how he speaks a thought, then follows up with reality. Like “come on, catch the hook” “but the hook did not catch”</li>
<li>Repetitive words used in new ways evoke new meaning</li>
<li>Keep it simple. <a href="../posts/mark-cuban-mogul-support.html">Mark Cuban Mogul Support</a> - don’t use a big word when a simpler one will do. He evokes strong emotion without much fanciful language.</li>
<li>Your mind fills in the blanks. He encodes the intuition of 50 years of fishing in plain words. “I’ve got enough line…” is not a calculation. <a href="../book-review/wool.html">Wool</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> are much more</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-01 - first you borrow. Then you beg. - “This too was a fiction” - “Relics of his wife” - he waits to reveal his wife. - I was born for this. - He could think of nothing except endure <img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/book-the-old-man-and-the-sea.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="The Old Man and The Sea"></p>

<ul>
<li>Rejection and retreat principle. Larger than smaller offers.</li>
<li>Contrast principle.</li>
<li>Reciprocity - people give more than they get out of a sense of burden.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-01-30</p>
<ul>
<li>Ackerman method from <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> applies to the concept of anchoring. Better to anchor at $2 then tell them $200 off than play a joke at $10000 but only offer $200.</li>
<li>Reciprocity - the small things compound over time. Give more than you expect to get.</li>
<li>“Because”. Giving reasons is persuasive, that word is a trigger.</li>

<p>Summmary: - very similar to <a href="../book-review/1984.html">1984</a>. Little communication. Mind control. - His writing style is unique: kill people just after they’re created. And the mindset right before they die is fascinating. “The cool of the grate, slippery” - someone’s last thoughts. - Psychology of leadership.</p>
<p>2024-01-25 - guess: they poison the people in the suits.</p>

<p>CBT: Emotional Reasoning, catastrophizing, labeling, Overgeneralising, black|white, mind reading, negative filtering, discounting positives, blaming</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Emotional reasoning. Confusing feelings with thoughts or reality is a cognitive distortion.</li>
<li>Catastrophizing imagines a sequence of events. But it’s seldom true.</li>
<li>Overgeneralising.</li>
<li>Dichotomous thinking. All or nothing thinking.</li>
<li>Mind reading</li>
<li>Labelling. Because someone belongs to a category doesn’t mean they embody all the traits of that category.</li>
<li>Negative filtering. Amplifying negative signals, so it overwhelms the positive.</li>
<li>Discounting positives. Rationalising away positive evidence as if it doesn’t count.</li>
<li>Blaming.</li>
</ol>

<li>tribalism.</li>

<li>Theory: we grow through being challenged, not the opposite. We are not our feelings.</li>

<li>Joseph was only one to receive revelation. → if you interpret this scripture out of context, you might think no other prophet is worthy to lead the church. But that was a point in time revelation. → like the book of revelation: don’t add to this.</li>
<li>Don’t covet thy own property → the Lord gives. He may recall for His purposes.</li>
<li>Land of promise to the saints → riches. Seek with all heart. many lands of promise. Missouri? Utah?</li>
<li>Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming. → why didn’t the Lord send the word immediately? He wanted to prepare people. He’s a fisher of men. A farmer of men. A lord of the vineyard.</li>

<p>“Where is your faith? Where is your confidence in God?” she demanded. “If you will all of you raise your desires to heaven, that the ice may be broken up and we be set at liberty, as sure as the Lord lives, it will be done.” <a href="../scriptures/11-ye-shall-receive-my-law">11 Ye Shall Receive My Law</a></p>

<ul>
<li>“Attend to it” - Joseph Senior supported Joseph. The Angel wanted Joseph to know this.</li>
<li>David’s field being ploughed overnight - a few items were left for David - the Lord did just enough. Also, the Lord honored the man’s request and didn’t disrespect him. The man got what he wanted, David did some more work, and the unnecessary part was finished by whomever.</li>
<li>Didn’t know that Jerusalem had a wall. <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-20-baptism-in-the-old-testament.html">1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament</a></li>
<li>Joseph’s trouble was being heavily persecuted physically. Like the Israelites. Now, physical persecution has mostly stopped and instead it’s just verbal assaults at “the church” from press and random voices on social media. The challenge of our day is to remain faithful.</li>

<h1>2024-02-06</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>A man convinced against his will of the same opinion remains still</p></li>
<li><p>You can’t win an argument # 2024-02-05</p></li>
<li><p>People want a feeling of self importance. It motivates their actions. Most people want to be important and try to find their way</p></li>
<li><p>To be interesting be interested</p></li>
<li><p>Always make the other person feel important.</p></li>
<li><p>“Every man I meet is my superior in some way” - Emerson</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-03</p>
<ul>
<li>you’ll make more friends being genuinely interested in others than trying to get them genuinely interested in you.</li>
<li>Authors: do they like people?</li>
<li>Being interested in others is cornerstone of sales.</li>
<li>Smile on the phone</li>
<li>Action and feeling go to gather. Fake it and you’ll make it. Smile.</li>
<li>Smiles bring you more richness than anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-01-22 - father poem. Father forgets. - bate the hook to please the fish - Tell them what they want - And how to get it - Lavish with praise. This is greater incentive than any criticism - What do they want? (Not what do I want?) “smoking will keep you from making the bball team” - Ford: put yourself in their position. Consider it. And consider your own - Consider how they’ll receive your email. They have a ton of problems. They’re overwhelmed. Don’t sell them. Teach them the benefits they’ll get. - Flattery vs appreciation - flattery is lip service. If you’re trying to convince someone to do something and you’re using flattery, then thats manipulation. And you’re prone to get angry if they don’t want to do it (kids). But if you’re sincere, you’ll find a solution - Arouse in others an eager want - Don’t tell someone an idea. Plant the seed and make them think it’s their own.</p>
<p>2024-01-20 - 85% of success is in non-technical skills. Communication. - We grow far faster by rewarding good behavior than punishing bad behavior - Kids. - Futility of criticism - Ask questions. “Does your hard hat not fit properly? It will save you.” - Don’t kick a beehive if you want honey - “I don’t see how I could have done any better” - Criticism - Abraham Lincoln never sent the letter -</p>

<p>I was reading the wrong book. I read <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> when my friends recommended <em>this</em> one instead.</p>
<p>I already like this one better. It lays things out better i feel. More chronological. But perhaps it’s because he has more time to write it.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/dymer_2206_librivox">Dymer : C. S. Lewis : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p>
<p>Knowing CS was in the war and had some relationship with Moore is fascinating.</p>

<li>Satan delights in having raised war, feeling he is proud and strong for resisting good. Being courageous to walk out. But his courage only warranted misery.</li>
<li>“The mind is powerful. Can make heaven of hell or hell of heaven.”</li>
<li>Why would Satan want to walk away, knowing he was giving up godhood? What motivated him more than happiness?</li>

</div>
<p>2024-01-16 - critique. Harsh critique. Safe space. - Get together. Review. Discuss ideas. Listen. - Freely gathered friends. Not assigned. Friends. This was important. Innovation. - Creating worlds is hard. So Tolkien told many stories within the lotr world. Same with Lewis and</p>
<p>2024-01-10</p>
<ul>
<li>long walks. Lewis would walk with Tolkien. Tolkien then wrote about a super long walk in the hobit and lotr</li>
<li>Language is the invention of objevts or ideas. Myth is the invention about truth. #post-ideas. Get this quote
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-01-09 Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tolkien build one language and derived it for two elvish languages.
<ul>
<li>Saw beauty in languages</li>
<li>Word at Oxford dictionary</li>
<li>Places like the shire were inspired by his experiences</li>
<li>Orcs represent machinists and wizards the old world.</li>
<li>Fellowship: his friends died in the war. The Tea Club. TCBS.</li>
<li>My grandma had the “double S” club.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>“Well read” - makes you more of what you already are?</p>
<p>Lewis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dymer: narrative poem
<ul>
<li>Plato’s republic</li>
<li>Dante.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>friendship is to disagree. To argue the other side just</li>
</ul>
<p>owen Barfield</p>
<ul>
<li>anyhroposophical</li>
<li>Evolution of consciousness
<ul>
<li>creativity is grounded, not whimsical, thinking. Even scientists would agree as they become creative in the process of making new discoveries. If you need a creative mind to get to a new way of thinking (new theory that becomes truth), isn’t the creative thinking truth itself? (Or rather it’s not just whimsical).</li>
<li>Imaginative thinking is crucial for both artistic creation and scientific discovery
<ul>
<li><a href="http://owenbarfield.org/BARFIELD/encyclopedia_barfieldiana/Ideas_Concepts/Science.html">Owenbarfield blog</a></li>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Takeaway - their creative ideas took decades to form. Or went years without being published. - Surround yourself with people who challenge you - They created a new syllabus. - power is to those who hold it. Everyone else adapts.</p>
<p>Blog ideas: - don’t mistake challenge with truth. Someone who is on mistrurh side can convince you</p>

<li>More political than the first. Focusing on the torment of a leader who has it all. What must it be like to have everything? The thought experiment is worth the read.</li>
<li>People try to kill him. Want his blood. His children. But he can’t have his wife, and sacrifices her and himself for the Dunes. May he enjoy his rest.</li>

<p>Notes: - socrates had a voice he felt was from Gods. Daimonion - Memorization. Lots of it. - Humanism - treated sacrifices to the gods as transactional. This meant they relied on themselves rather than gods to teach them. - Odd relationships (pedophelia) - function: intended purpose. Virtue: quality of function.</p>

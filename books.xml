  <title>Power and Prediction</title>
  <dc:creator>Joshua Gans, Jay Agrawal, Avi Goldfarb</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/power-and-prediction.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>point vs systemic shift. The book largely focuses on how AI will be used for systemic shifts. Those who embrace it, like those who embraced electricity over steam power, will have to reinvent their businesses from the ground up. They should do so by thinking about The core principles of their business and what’s a judgment and what’s a decision. They can become far more efficient by abandoning rules and procedures and instead focus on decisions. They can automate certain decisions using data.</li>
<li>Those who go to market to collect data first have a huge advantage. It’s the reason Google has outperformed Bing for a decade - it gets better data and feedback and uses that to make the product more efficient. Data collection is essential to a great data product - not only the data you begin the project with, but the data that brings it to life.</li>
<li>What will I do differently? I’ll try to think more systemically about how organizations I work in are operated by human judgment that can be automated. The book provides a framework for approaching such systemic shifts.</li>
<li>I’m also interested to see what they’d write about today’s day and age, as this was published right as ChatGPT came out and is now changing a lot. That being said, I think the main principle of decomposing the business into its central parts still stands as the thesis of the book. There’s also a big difference between Generative AI and predictive AI (machine learning). Gen AI is now going to unlock a whole lot of applications, but the principles still remain the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-15</p>
<ul>
<li><p>prediction va judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>Flywheel of AI. Feedback data is the most important.</p></li>
<li><p>Thinking in bets. →. Luck vs bad decision</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize weather forecasts. Get up earlier</p></li>
<li><p>Flint lead pipes. Political judgment stalled work</p></li>
<li><p>Prediction vs judgment systems. Need to create a new system to handle probabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>AI windfall - one sure gets more efficient and causes issues upstream</p></li>
<li><p>Algorithmic bias can be solved because it can be examined.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Who should decide? - Information - skills - Incentives - Coordination</p>
<p>Redesign the company from an AI systemic view: - judgment and decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who sees what vs who decides what.</li>
<li>Rules vs decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-13</p>
<ul>
<li>power is scarcity. AI power?</li>
<li>Those with power prevent system changes. But those who adopt systemic shifts will disrupt those who are stuck in the old ways.</li>
<li>systemic shifts. Companies need to rethink their businesses around AI. What can change? What’s too prohibitive to change? How do regulations change?</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-13</p>
<ul>
<li>airports: a decision. Security. Risk ca reward.
<ul>
<li>Highest security is manually reviewing all things.</li>
<li>Allow the machine to review things with some probability of missing a knife.</li>
<li>Let everyone in.</li>
<li>Cost: how much time people spend.</li>
<li>Costs: a plane crashing into another building.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rules vs decisions.
<ul>
<li>Rules are pre-determined or general decisions instead of making them personalized and relevant in the moment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-12</p>
<ul>
<li>the between time. Lightbulb took 20 years before 50% of houses had it.
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Point solutions
<ul>
<li>lower cost of power. No change to factory system</li>
<li>Can improve a single procedure without changing the system which embeds it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Application
<ul>
<li>Individual electric drives on each machine. Swappable. If one stops it doesn’t stop the others. Modularity the factory but still keep it the same layout.</li>
<li>Can enable a single thing to do more things.</li>
<li>Enables a new procedure without changing the system in which it’s embedded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>System solutions → change how the system is designed → steam vs electricity. Exploit by decoupling power source from factory element. → layout the machine how it’s supposed to and get the power to where it is.
<ul>
<li>Enables new procedures or changes existing procedures by changing dependent procedures.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Ai point solution: - improves a single decision without affecting other decisions AI Application solution - Enables new decision or changes how a decision is made without affecting other solutions AI system solution - Improves or enables new decisions only if changes to how decisions are made is implemented</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<ul>
<li>prediction: concert information you have to information you need</li>
<li>Ripe for adoption (business and customers are already familiar with risky decisions.) system shift: needs to change how people do things to be more efficient.</li>
<li>Randomized</li>

<p>2024-04-04 summary</p>
<ul>
<li>This and <a href="../book-review/1984.html">1984</a> are two books everyone should read. This book was written 93 years ago and it’s eerily prescient of what’s happening in society. The pursuits of happiness and the role of the state and technology to those ends are evergreen topics. The pains that John felt entering a society but choosing true happiness over contrived ones.</li>
<li>Parallels today: people escaping to social media and TikTok like soma</li>
<li>People wanting government to solve all their problems → the 20,000 alphas who wanted the government to step in</li>
<li>People feeling adrift without an internal purpose and happy to just accept what comes their way or what society conditions them to believe → independent thinkers banished to islands</li>
<li>Over optimization of Silicon Valley trying to optimize everything in their life</li>
<li>Linda and John’s fates as they enter a world they don’t belong to. Adrift.</li>
<li>Society gawking at the savage like we gawk at social media.</li>
<li>The whole thing just captures human behavior so brilliantly.</li>

  <title>Adult Children of Emotional Immature Parents</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>2024-04-01</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional work is hard work. Emotionally immature people feel like they don’t need</li>
<li>Roles are sacred to emotional immature people: role of parent.</li>
<li>Kids feel like they have to help solve their parents emotional problems but they can’t.</li>
<li>They seek enmeshment, not intimacy</li>
<li>emotional parents</li>
<li>Driven parents</li>
<li>passive parwnts</li>
<li>healing dreams. Creates roles. Role-self vs true self. “If only I…” is a coping mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-30</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t see their role in your problems.</li>
<li>don’t tell you about stuff.</li>
<li>Self referential vs self reflective</li>
<li>Expressing feelings wasn’t condoned or supported.</li>
<li>Crying stops when given emotional support. “I’ll give you something to cry about”</li>
<li>Focuses on facts and dive deep in intellectual topics but not emotions</li>
<li>Overemphasize physical health → we can feel as children a bond to those who took physical care of us but not emotional.</li>
</ul>

<li>the weathervane: told the wind to stop bothering it. You’re messing me up.
<ul>
<li>The whole point of the weathervane is to give direction to the wind.</li>
<li>Do I question the thing that gives me employment? Gives me work?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The four poets: sometimes we all love to talk about something but don’t actually enjoy it</li>
<li>The four frogs: one of us wants to be right. We get angry with someone who tells us we’re all right, as well as someone who doesn’t want to challenge us - who won’t play in our game. They’re the enemy because They didn’t stoop to our level and caught us in our vice. (There was a person I didn’t like once but I now realize it’s because they didn’t stoop to my level )</li>
<li>The stolen horse: we all accuse the victim. Why don’t we focus on the stealer of a horse? We blame those who come to us for advice sometime.</li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox">Watch his Ted talk</label></li>
</ul>
<p>Phrases</p>
<ul>
<li>fascism turns everyone into a slave. The slaves first. Then the captors who have no choice but to be a captor</li>
<li>Couldn’t even escape because he’d be shot at by other people who were afraid.</li>
<li>Why would you argue with a loved one? Argue instead with the person who litters. There’s no time for arguing with a loved one.</li>
<li>I chose to be the happiest man on earth. There could not be a sweeter revenge against people who wanted to take away everything</li>
<li>I don’t believe the world is only full of hate. I don’t blame any survivor who has that opinion. The are many who struggle like that. They were liberated from physical captivity but their hearts were broken.</li>
<li>just do good work. Take pride in doing meaningful work in your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-15</p>
<ul>
<li>he escaped and was shot at and returned</li>
<li>1 hour of rest is two days of survival. Conserving energy.</li>
<li>Running to the wire.</li>
<li>I could not have survived without friends. Without Kurt.</li>
<li>Shave heads to be free from lice.</li>
<li>Bromide in the coffee. Chemically castrate.</li>
<li>one louse meant the whole house to be burned.</li>
<li>Examined by the weight of your buttocks</li>
<li>The body is the best machine.</li>
<li>“Don’t you have a soul?” → he wasn’t so courageous when he was alone. He never hit me again.</li>
<li>My education saved me.</li>
<li>Where there is hope there is life.</li>
<li>I know many who took their own life when they were liberated because they had nothing to live for.</li>
<li>Hides in a sewage pipe.</li>
<li>Crawled out of a cave to a road.</li>
<li>Finds Kurt. Always a miracle.</li>
<li>Old anti semitic attitudes are hard to fade. “Greedy Jews” after he gets a job.</li>
<li>Sulfer baths.</li>
<li>Rescues 3 women from suicide. Duty of the fortunate to help the suffering. Simple act of kindness → saved the life of these women.</li>
<li>Found someone in his suit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happiness - you’ll never be happy with comparison. - Loved saved me. - Happiness comes from inside. Happiness doubles each time you share it.</p>
<p>2024-03-14</p>
<ul>
<li>Germans made a religion of logic, and it turned them cruel</li>
<li>The dichotomy that you could be fined 200 franks for littering a cigarette butt and yet they threw children into the river,</li>
<li>Crystallnacht. Broken glass.</li>
<li>What would have happened had he not returned home that night?</li>
<li>“I made the worst decision”. It’s what you say, but the decision itself to visit family was perhaps a good one. Resulting.</li>
<li>“Are you hungry?” → the French did the most to help Jews.</li>
<li>1936 for Spanish people leaving the Spanish civil war.</li>
<li>15,000 prison</li>
<li>Trains filled with fumes</li>
<li>Doctor who used a razor to suicide over a latrine</li>

<li>Train car with 44 liters of water for the whole train. His dad rationed 155 cups.</li>
<li>“go tell your mother how much you love her. Do it for your new friend, Eddie, who cannot”. Sent to gas chambers.</li>
<li>How could Hitler make enemies of friends, then civilized men into inhuman zombies. How could Hitler create such hate?</li>
<li>Go to sleep naked. Wake up with naked</li>
<li>Rags were more precious than gold.</li>
<li>Germans were detailed and record keepers, which made them killers.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>about 70% of an instructive story and 30% the true content. The story is really cringe/cheesy but helps introduce the ideas.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.shortform.com/blog/the-6-types-of-working-genius/">The 6 Types of Working Genius: Book Overview | Shortform Books</a></p>
<p>We all have things that either energize or drain us. If we’re aware, we can complement each other.</p>
<p>Three phases of work/a task: ideation, activation, and implementation. Each task requires two types of genius.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideation
<ul>
<li>Wonder: Ask why? Ask “is there a better way?”</li>
<li>Innovation: figure out solutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Activation
<ul>
<li>Discernment: use intuition and judgment in figuring out good/bad ideas</li>
<li>Galvanize/rally people/buy-in</li>
</ul></li>
<li>implementation
<ul>
<li>Enable: volunteer. Help people. Empower.</li>
<li>Tenacity: cross the finish line. Execute. Pound obstacles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Six type of genius more concretely defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wonder: Involved the ability to ponder, speculate, and question the state of things. Asking the questions that provoke answer and action. People with this genius are naturally inclined to do these things, to lose themselves in observing the world around them and wondering if things shouldn’t be different or untapped potential that should be tapped.</li>
<li>Innovation: come up with new ideas or solutions. They’re drawn to origination, creativity and ingenuity, even with little context or directions. Though every type is a genius, these are the people who are most often referred to as geniuses because many of their ideas seem to come out of thin air.</li>
<li>Discernment: related to sanctity, intuition, and uncanny judgment. People with this genius have the natural ability to assess an idea or situation even without a lot of data or expertises. Using pattern recognition and gut feel they’re able to provide valuable advice and feedback around most subjects in a way that transcends their levels of specific knowledge or information.</li>
<li>Galvanizing: is about rallying, motivating, or provoking people to take action around an idea or an initiative. People with this genius are naturally inclined to inspire or enlist people to get involved in an endeavor. They don’t mind persuading people to rethink or change their plans to embark on something worthwhile.</li>
<li>Enabling: providing people with support and assistance in a way that it is needed. People with this genius are adept at responding to the needs of others without conditions or restrictions. They’re naturally inclined to help others accomplish their goals and can often anticipate what people might need before they ask. Individuals with this genius are frequently unaware that this is a genius at all.</li>
<li>Tenacity: is about the satisfaction of pushing things across the finish line to completion. They’re not only capable of and naturally inclined to finish projects to ensure they’re completed to specification. They gain energy by pushing through obstacles and seeing the impact of their work and they find joy from crossing tasks off their list and getting closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Categories of genius - each person has two geniuses, two competencies, and two frustrations. (Per their research)</p>
<ul>
<li>Genius: it energizes you. Joy, energy, and passion.</li>
<li>Competency: it neither energizes nor drains you. Can do fairly well. But we will eventually grow weary if we can do our geniuses.</li>
<li>Frustration: it drains you. Struggle. Hate it. You can spent a ton of time here without getting to burnout, or failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Genius activation modes: you’ll probably have two responsive and two disruptive geniuses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive: respond to an external stimulus to be put into action. Need to be activated by an event.</li>
<li>Disruptive: initiate or provoke change when they see a need for it. More proactive.</li>
</ul>

<li>Different metrics may have seasonality at different times. (Different SOs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Application ideas: - to diagnose a time series, make a plot of metric over time colored by year. - Helps pick up how to do feature engineering. - Plot each day, over time of day. - Plot each day over day of week - Facet by month, plot revenue over year. - Plot Y ~ X’s. - Plot Y ~ lag (Y) to identify seasonality. - Plot autocorr(Y) using Statsmodels. Group by day. <img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-seasonal-year-metric.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Seasonal year metric plot"></p>

<p>Occasionally, old data will be less useful due to structural changes in the system being forecast; then we may choose to use only the most recent data</p>

<ul>
<li>People have always wanted to forecast, such as ancients using the shape of sheep liver to predict the future. Tarot cards, prophets, etc have been religious and spiritual forecasters.</li>
<li>Forecasting has always been a guessing game.</li>
<li>Sometimes you can use algorithms to mine historical data for forecasting, but that assumes the future will be like the past.</li>

  <title>Mere Christianity</title>
  <dc:creator>C.S. Lewis</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/mere-christianity.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<ul>
<li>Cs Lewis didn’t listen to his friends. He wrote anyway. And I’m grateful that he did. It’s a shame anyone feels like they shouldn’t write because they don’t believe they have the authority to.</li>
<li>I’m impressed by his rigor. His thoughtfulness. It’s thought provoking. The reasoning is well laid out.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-18</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a part of God within us.</li>
<li>The Lord is working on all people, to bring Christianity even into their own religions.</li>
<li>Pride is the worst sin.</li>
<li>the way is easy but it’s hard to give in to let Him lead. The lazy person fights letting Him lead.</li>
<li>Rats hiding from the light.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-17</p>
<ul>
<li>the love of something quickly phases and the lasting thing is the true love. Then that type of person is more likely to find more surprise, compared to the person always chasing the fleeting immediately love.</li>
<li>Pride: having more than another</li>
<li>A someone with hatred in their heart but a desire to wish well on someone will start feeling charity for that person. Practice it, and you’ll feel it. So long as your intent is pure.</li>
<li>The desire within us is reflective of something more. Desire to eat can only be satisfied by food. Desire for purpose can only be satisfied by Him.</li>
<li>We become like him as a line becomes a shape and a shape becomes a polyhedron.</li>
<li>The instrument needs to be clean. A man who keeps himself clean and bright will be able to receive God. Same frequency.</li>
<li>Christianity provides the true purpose for life.</li>
<li>Three dimensions: Godnspeaks to me, god is within me, and Christ is of God praying for me, giving me the words to pray for
<ul>
<li><a href="../book-review/the-prophet.html">The Prophet</a> → you can only pray the words given to you (god only listens to the words he gives to you )</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-10</p>
<ul>
<li>Good people know about good and evil, the way a sober person clearly understands a drunk.</li>
<li>Giving charitably. Give more than you can, sacrificing some things for it.</li>
<li>I love the theology he thinks through, such as repentance and such. But he also delves specifically into doctrines like saying whether sexual perversion is worse or better than being a nice person to someone else. Perhaps this is the content Tolkien wished he had left to clergy people. <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-03</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote <a href="../christianity/2024-03-03-my-testimony.html">My Testimony</a> today without having read this book - cool to see we both had the same logic on “math” and “law of nature”.</li>
<li>I love his “unseen hand” or “to compare something as moral or immoral you must do it against some standard”</li>
<li>When speaking you can use inflection. When writing, you shouldn’t use italics because there are better ways of emphasizing the point. Ways you might not be able to employ with just writing.</li>

  <title>The 6 Types of Working Genius</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>about 70% of an instructive story and 30% the true content. The story is really cringe/cheesy but helps introduce the ideas.</li>
<li>Back 30% presents the concrete definitions. It lays out how a team can truly work together as a team to complement each other’s strengths.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shortform.com/blog/the-6-types-of-working-genius/">The 6 Types of Working Genius: Book Overview | Shortform Books</a></p>
<p>We all have things that either energize or drain us. If we’re aware, we can complement each other.</p>
<p>Three phases of work/a task: ideation, activation, and implementation. Each task requires two types of genius.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideation
<ul>
<li>Wonder: Ask why? Ask “is there a better way?”</li>
<li>Innovation: figure out solutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Activation
<ul>
<li>Discernment: use intuition and judgment in figuring out good/bad ideas</li>
<li>Galvanize/rally people/buy-in</li>
</ul></li>
<li>implementation
<ul>
<li>Enable: volunteer. Help people. Empower.</li>
<li>Tenacity: cross the finish line. Execute. Pound obstacles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Six type of genius more concretely defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wonder: Involved the ability to ponder, speculate, and question the state of things. Asking the questions that provoke answer and action. People with this genius are naturally inclined to do these things, to lose themselves in observing the world around them and wondering if things shouldn’t be different or untapped potential that should be tapped.</li>
<li>Innovation: come up with new ideas or solutions. They’re drawn to origination, creativity and ingenuity, even with little context or directions. Though every type is a genius, these are the people who are most often referred to as geniuses because many of their ideas seem to come out of thin air.</li>
<li>Discernment: related to sanctity, intuition, and uncanny judgment. People with this genius have the natural ability to assess an idea or situation even without a lot of data or expertises. Using pattern recognition and gut feel they’re able to provide valuable advice and feedback around most subjects in a way that transcends their levels of specific knowledge or information.</li>
<li>Galvanizing: is about rallying, motivating, or provoking people to take action around an idea or an initiative. People with this genius are naturally inclined to inspire or enlist people to get involved in an endeavor. They don’t mind persuading people to rethink or change their plans to embark on something worthwhile.</li>
<li>Enabling: providing people with support and assistance in a way that it is needed. People with this genius are adept at responding to the needs of others without conditions or restrictions. They’re naturally inclined to help others accomplish their goals and can often anticipate what people might need before they ask. Individuals with this genius are frequently unaware that this is a genius at all.</li>
<li>Tenacity: is about the satisfaction of pushing things across the finish line to completion. They’re not only capable of and naturally inclined to finish projects to ensure they’re completed to specification. They gain energy by pushing through obstacles and seeing the impact of their work and they find joy from crossing tasks off their list and getting closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Categories of genius - each person has two geniuses, two competencies, and two frustrations. (Per their research)</p>
<ul>
<li>Genius: it energizes you. Joy, energy, and passion.</li>
<li>Competency: it neither energizes nor drains you. Can do fairly well. But we will eventually grow weary if we can do our geniuses.</li>
<li>Frustration: it drains you. Struggle. Hate it. You can spent a ton of time here without getting to burnout, or failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Genius activation modes: you’ll probably have two responsive and two disruptive geniuses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive: respond to an external stimulus to be put into action. Need to be activated by an event.</li>
<li>Disruptive: initiate or provoke change when they see a need for it. More proactive.</li>
</ul>

<li>Judgmental forecasts vs qualitative forecasts. (Superforecasters )</li>

<p>Occasionally, old data will be less useful due to structural changes in the system being forecast; then we may choose to use only the most recent data</p>

<li>People have always wanted to forecast, such as ancients using the shape of sheep liver to predict the future. Tarot cards, prophets, etc have been religious and spiritual forecasters.</li>
<li>Forecasting has always been a guessing game.</li>
<li>Sometimes you can use algorithms to mine historical data for forecasting, but that assumes the future will be like the past.</li>

  <title>Mere Christianity</title>
  <dc:creator>C.S. Lewis</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<ul>
<li>Cs Lewis didn’t listen to his friends</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-10</p>
<ul>
<li>Good people know about good and evil, the way a sober person clearly understands a drunk.</li>
<li>Giving charitably. Give more than you can, sacrificing some things for it.</li>
<li>I love the theology he thinks through, such as repentance and such. But he also delves specifically into doctrines like saying whether sexual perversion is worse or better than being a nice person to someone else. Perhaps this is the content Tolkien wished he had left to clergy people. <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-03</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote <a href="../christianity/2024-03-03-my-testimony.html">My Testimony</a> today without having read this book - cool to see we both had the same logic on “math” and “law of nature”.</li>
<li>I love his “unseen hand” or “to compare something as moral or immoral you must do it against some standard”</li>
<li>When speaking you can use inflection. When writing, you shouldn’t use italics because there are better ways of emphasizing the point. Ways you might not be able to employ with just writing.</li>

<p>2024-03-09</p>
<p>Interesting stories:</p>
<ul>
<li>noticing the new tree</li>
<li>Webster’s commentaries</li>
<li>The personalities</li>
<li>The mental fortitude and collapse</li>
<li>How 101 went to the fight while other people retreated.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-06</p>
<ul>
<li>the book is a review of battles in incredible detail. Lots of details on maneuvers. But also shows the desperation. Of the situation.</li>
<li>things that impacted me:
<ul>
<li>The way they react to bullets and artillery. Sometimes laughing. Then crying.</li>
<li>The war breaks some people. They go crazy.</li>
<li>Some shot their own hands to avoid the war</li>
<li>Million dollar</li>
<li>Cover fire.</li>
<li>Looting. Lent up energy. 60+ days no showering. Digging own fox holes deep. Friendly fire and shooting or bayoneting own people. Miracle of a stray bullet not killing you.</li>
<li>Polish with guns behind their back (from Germany) so they’d fight.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQatuQdQv4">YouTube video on the war</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/SOiiSgDLkn4?si=gOmnG9mEBzy22h6Y">YouTube - battle of the bulge google maps</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c91v7jLDnAg">YouTube battle of dunkirk 1940</a></p>
<p>2024-03-02</p>
<ul>
<li>they want to be with the best rather than the common infantry unit. Their chances of survival are higher.</li>

  <title>The Sun Also Rises</title>
  <dc:creator>Ernest Hemingway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/the-sun-also-rises.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The story is one of Brett and her influence on a group of men. Jake, whom she doesn’t want to be with because of an injury, Robert Cohn, who wanted to treat her well, then Mike who is a count, bankrupt, and a Lord with access to money, and Bill, who doesn’t interact with Brett much.</p>
<p>Then Brett runs away with Pedro.</p>
<p>She can’t help herself. She ends up back in Jake’s arms, asking him for help when she could have asked Mike. She settles on Mike.</p>
<p>She lives without morals - floating with the sea. Jake is an observer.</p>
<p>Personal impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>the dialogue is captivating. Calming in a sense. Meditative. Simple.</li>
<li>On its surface all that happens is chats at bars, a bull fight, and a lot of drinking.</li>
<li>They all want something more, and end up fighting each other for it. None</li>
<li>All the characters are predictable. Their arcs hardly evolve. They just meander. And perhaps that’s the point. It’s the lost generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-26</p>
<ul>
<li>hemingway’s writing is so calming.</li>
<li><a href="../creative/prose-nuzzle.html">Nuzzle</a> was written as inspiration…</li>

<p>Comparison to <a href="../book-review/band-of-brothers.html">Band of Brothers</a></p>
<ul>
<li>focuses more on winter’s specific things, though many things are similar. More stories in the other book.</li>
<li>while other people</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-09</p>
<p>When I meet people i size them up.</p>
<p>Ambrose: I would follow Winters because he was honest and knew how to lay down a cover of fire.</p>
<p>Three stages</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This can’t happen to me</li>
<li>This could happen to me</li>
<li>This is going to happen to me. → combat fatigue. Take off helmet and just put hand through hair.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people snapped.</p>
<p>Reflections</p>
<ul>
<li>while others were partying, I was studying.</li>
<li>Don’t define leadership. It’s “follow me”. You can’t make sound decisions unless you’re affected by the decision.</li>
<li>Great physical fitness means you can make sound decisions. → physical fitness to push yourself.</li>
<li>Nourish teamwork.</li>
<li>If you don’t worry about the credit, you get a lot more done. Blame yourself with a failure. Credit the team with a victory.</li>
<li>Reflect.</li>
<li>Hang tough. True satisfaction comes from getting the job done.</li>
<li>No man hangs his wings on his chest. He wears them within his heart.</li>
<li>War brings out the worst and the best in men. Wars do not make men great, but they bring out the greatness in good men. War is romantic for those farthest away from it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leadership from the bayonette. 10 points of leadership by dick winters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strive to be a leader of character, competence, and courage.</li>
<li>Lead from the front. Say, “Follow me!” and then lead the way.</li>
<li>Stay in top physical shape—physical stamina is the root of mental toughness.</li>
<li>Develop your team. If you know your people, are fair in setting realistic goals and expectations, and lead by example, you will develop teamwork.</li>
<li>Delegate responsibility to your subordinates and let them do their jobs. You can’t do a good job if you don’t have a chance to use your imagination or your creativity.</li>
<li>Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don’t wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind.</li>
<li>Remain humble. Don’t worry about who receives the credit. Never let power or authority go to your head.</li>
<li>Take a moment of self-reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself if you did your best.</li>
<li>True satisfaction comes from getting the job done. The key to a successful leader is to earn respect—not because of rank or position, but because you are a leader of character.</li>
<li>Hang tough!—Never, ever give up.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-02-22</p>
<ul>
<li>dick winters’ was just a boy from rural Penn. His dad made $40 a month. He got into the army and became something else. Excellence is no respecter of persons.</li>

  <title>Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team</title>

<p>What did I take away from this?</p>
<ul>
<li>No all groups are teams</li>
<li>Teams are 5-12</li>
<li>Too many means advocacy overrules inquiry in decision making</li>
<li>Leaders want to rule their tribes, but they need to recognize they’re part of the leadership team.</li>
<li>Teams have an objective.</li>
<li>Sometimes cutting one person out can immediately improve the team, but often most people need to be challenged or coached. Most will rise to the occasion. This is a long-held personal principle: don’t fire. Focus on where that person can thrive. Try three places. Then if it’s not working out or they’re resisting, then fire.</li>
<li>Be vulnerable, not too much</li>
<li>Team bonding isn’t socializing. Team cohesion is doing the hardest work possible: grappling with honesty, candidness, and coming out on top.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-20</p>
<ul>
<li>commitment clarity
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cascading communication
<ul>
<li>Communicate within 24 hours</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Advocacy vs inquiry.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-19</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Absence of trust</li>
<li>Fear of conflict</li>
<li>Lack of commitment</li>
<li>Avoidance of accountability</li>
<li>Inattention to results</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>we often attribute a leader’s dysfunctions to a xharacter flaw (internal) but attribute our own dysfunctions to situstional things (external) and attribute someone’s success to external (luck) but our own success to internal (good at something)</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/daring-greatly.html">Daring Greatly</a> and <a href="../book-review/dare-to-lead.html">Dare to Lead</a> both talk about the power of vulnerability. This guy talks about how vulnerability breeds trust.</li>

<ul>
<li>Loss aversion.</li>
<li>Create vulnerability</li>
<li>Specific call to action to resolve the risk.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transitional call to action: give something away for free. → establish yourself as a leader. Reciprocity. Give more away for free. They’ll want to buy your workshop. <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a></li>
<li>Three story endings
<ul>
<li>Win power or possession</li>
<li>Be unified with someone or something that makes them whole</li>
<li>experience Some self realization that makes them whole</li>

<li>In machine learning, who is the hero? Is it the model? Who is the guide? Me? My boss is the hero. The model is the guide?

<li>Marketing

<li>ended how it should have. Total absolution. What a story.</li>
<li>Things I liked: the warring perspectives of how to survive, the question of what is law and order when nothing is going on, the dangers men will go to, the antics nations will rage for a fraction of the return on investment (ansombs’ bounty was a fraction of what was paid for the voyage.). The kweskar are incredible. The four different return voyages home.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Cape horn! Crazy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Scottish man you’re referring to is Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean, now known as Robinson Crusoe Island, part of the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile. Selkirk lived alone on the island from 1704 to 1709. His story is believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe’s novel “Robinson Crusoe.” Selkirk was a skilled navigator and sailor, and his survival skills, including hunting, gathering, and shelter building, allowed him to survive until he was eventually rescued by an English ship. His experience highlights the human capacity for adaptation and survival in extreme conditions.</p>

  <title>Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</title>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>complements go a long way. Spread good rumors.</li>
<li>Find similarities.</li>
<li>You gain back more than what you give. So give more.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-13</p>
<ul>
<li>people are more likely to be influenced by and ad when they don’t think it’s an ad</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-10</p>
<ul>
<li>Rejection and retreat principle. Larger than smaller offers.</li>
<li>Contrast principle.</li>
<li>Reciprocity - people give more than they get out of a sense of burden.</li>
<li>Reciprocity - your good works are not lost if they’re felt sincere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Liking:</p>
<ul>
<li>“it’s impossible to change someone’s belief with reasoning when they didn’t use reasoning and logic to come to that belief in the first place”</li>
<li>“You cannot reason a person out a position he did not reason himself into in the first place” - Jonathan Swift #quotes</li>
<li>Liking: finding genuine similarities between you and the other.</li>
<li>In group vs out group</li>
<li>Assigning labels, such as mascots or alter names</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-01-30</p>
<ul>
<li>Ackerman method from <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> applies to the concept of anchoring. Better to anchor at $2 then tell them $200 off than play a joke at $10000 but only offer $200.</li>
<li>Reciprocity - the small things compound over time. Give more than you expect to get.</li>
<li>“Because”. Giving reasons is persuasive, that word is a trigger.</li>
</ul>

<p>Summmary: - very similar to <a href="../book-review/1984.html">1984</a>. Little communication. Mind control. - His writing style is unique: kill people just after they’re created. And the mindset right before they die is fascinating. “The cool of the grate, slippery” - someone’s last thoughts. - Psychology of leadership.</p>
<p>2024-01-25 - guess: they poison the people in the suits.</p>

<p>2024-03-13</p>
<p>How to practice CBT</p>
<ul>
<li>read “feeling good” by David burns</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thecoddling.com/how-to-do-cbt">Appendix 1: How to Do CBT | coddling</a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Take a moment to write down what you are feeling if you’re anxious, depressed, or upset</li>
<li>Write down your level of distress (1-100)</li>
<li>Write down what happened and what your automatic thoughts were when you felt the pang of anxie th or despair</li>
<li>Consider the categories of distortions and write them down. “This is catastrophizing”</li>
<li>Look for evidence for and against your thought</li>
<li>Ask yourself what someone might say if they disagree with you. Is there any merit in that argument?</li>
<li>Consider again what happens and reevaluate without the cognitive distortions.</li>
<li>Write down your new feelings.</li>
<li>Write again the weight of your thoughts.</li>
</ol>
<p>All 17 distortions from <a href="https://www.thecoddling.com/how-to-do-cbt">Appendix 1: How to Do CBT | coddling</a></p>
<p>Categories of Distorted Automatic Thoughts</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>MIND READING: You assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinksI’m a loser.”</p></li>
<li><p>FORTUNE- TELLING: You predict the future negatively: Things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “I’ll fail that exam,” or “I won’t get the job.”</p></li>
<li><p>CATASTROPHIZING: You believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand it. “It would be terrible if I failed.”</p></li>
<li><p>LABELING: You assign global negative traits to yourself and others.“I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”</p></li>
<li><p>DISCOUNTING POSITIVES: You claim that the positive things you or others do are trivial. “That’s what wives are supposed to do— so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”</p></li>
<li><p>NEGATIVE FILTERING: You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.”</p></li>
<li><p>OVERGENERALIZING: You perceive a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”</p></li>
<li><p>DICHOTOMOUS THINKING: You view events or people in all‑or ‑ ‑nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”</p></li>
<li><p>SHOULDS: You interpret events in terms of how things should be, rather than simply focusing on what is. “I should do well. If I don’t, then I’m a failure.”</p></li>
<li><p>PERSONALIZING: You attribute a disproportionate amount of the blame to yourself for negative events, and you fail to see that certain events are also caused by others. “The marriage ended because I failed.”&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>BLAMING: You focus on the other person as the source of your negative feelings, and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all my problems.”</p></li>
<li><p>UNFAIR COMPARISONS: You interpret events in terms of standards that are unrealistic— for example, you focus primarily on others who do better than you and find yourself inferior in the comparison. “She’s more successful than I am,” or “Others did better than Idid on the test.”</p></li>
<li><p>REGRET ORIENTATION: You focus on the idea that you could have done better in the past, rather than on what you can do better now.“I could have had a better job if I had tried,” or “I shouldn’t have said that.”</p></li>
<li><p>WHAT IF?: You keep asking a series of questions about “what if”something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “Yeah, but what if I get anxious?” or “What if I can’t catch my breath?”</p></li>
<li><p>EMOTIONAL REASONING: You let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”</p></li>
<li><p>INABILITY TO DISCONFIRM: You reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. For example, when you have the thought “I’m unlovable,” you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. Consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “That’s not the real issue. There are deeper problems.There are other factors.”</p></li>
<li><p>JUDGMENT FOCUS: You view yourself, others, and events in terms of evaluations as good– bad or superior– inferior, rather than simply describing, accepting, or understanding. You are continually measuring yourself and others according to arbitrary standards, and finding that you and others fall short. You are focused on the judgments of others as well as your own judgments of yourself. “I didn’t perform well in college,” or “If I take up tennis, I won’t do well,” or“Look how successful she is. I’m not successful.”</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>I feel this could have been written today.</li>
<li>Safetyism. Words are harmful.</li>
<li>Screens &gt; 2 hours a day increase risk of suicide.</li>
<li>Kids are being coddled. Over worked. Over engineered for top tier schools. But who says those schools produce successful people? What’s the goal of getting into a top tier university? Will you really be better off in life? Most of the kids aren’t able to handle life and enjoy it.</li>
<li>College has become a country club. Pay $100k/year.</li>
<li>Kids</li>
<li>Essentially, his theory is that universities are getting more fragile kids who are playing less, on social media more. They pursue safetyism. They give up liberties such as</li>
<li>Let your kid walk where is safe for them to do so. Avoid overprotection.
<ul>
<li>Prepare kids.</li>
<li>Free from adult guidance.</li>
<li>Productive disagreement. Teach kids to argue productively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“Talk with strangers, just never go off with them”</li>
<li>Kids today at 18 have the maturity of 15 year olds 20 years ago. Too much time on phones. Too much time afraid, even though substantively less crime.</li>
<li>Mindfulness:</li>
</ul>
<p>Adam grant on good conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame it as a debate rather than a conflict</li>
<li>Argue as if you’re right but listen as if you’re wrong and be willing to change your mind</li>
<li>Give the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective</li>
<li>Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you’ve learned from them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your own thoughts unguarded.</p>

<p>CBT: Emotional Reasoning, catastrophizing, labeling, Overgeneralising, black|white, mind reading, negative filtering, discounting positives, blaming</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Emotional reasoning. Confusing feelings with thoughts or reality is a cognitive distortion.</li>
<li>Catastrophizing imagines a sequence of events. But it’s seldom true.</li>
<li>Overgeneralising.</li>
<li>Dichotomous thinking. All or nothing thinking.</li>
<li>Mind reading</li>
<li>Labelling. Because someone belongs to a category doesn’t mean they embody all the traits of that category.</li>
<li>Negative filtering. Amplifying negative signals, so it overwhelms the positive.</li>
<li>Discounting positives. Rationalising away positive evidence as if it doesn’t count.</li>
<li>Blaming.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>tribalism.</li>
<li>CARE framework for responding to challenges.</li>
<li>Theory: we grow through being challenged, not the opposite. We are not our feelings.</li>
<li>Principle of charity: assume the best intent (not the worst)</li>
<li>prepare the kid for the road, not the road for the kid. Life is the road.</li>
<li>People are afraid to speak up For fear of being cancelled.</li>

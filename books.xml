<li>Design and build it in a way that a few people will really benefit</li>
<li>Tell a story that matches the built-in narrative of those people. The smallest viable market.</li>
<li>Spread the word</li>
<li>Show up. Regularly, consistently, and generously for years and years. To organize, lead, and build confidence in the change you seek to make. To earn permission to follow up and earn enrollment to teach. Help the idea spread from person to person. Engage a tribe as you make things happen.</li>

<ul>
<li>storytelling: I really like how <a href="../book-review/shift.html">Shift</a> does the psychological aspect of perishing. Last moments, last thoughts. I think Tolkien could have enhanced some of the fighting scenes by documenting the last moments.</li>
<li>It’s interesting how in the movie the destruction is the big climax, but in the book Isengard is already destroyed before they get there. I like the suspense of not knowing what’s going to happen.</li>
<li>But the nature of LOtR is that it’s a story told by people. A story within stories. The council of Elrond was very well written. Stories within stories. Each person telling their own story.</li>
<li>I like how Tolkien has so much back context. That’s what makes it so interesting. It’s not just Frodo’s story. But Frodo is context amidst a great history of many people.</li>
<li>It makes sense why LOTR is really just one book. That’s how it’s written. One massive epic.</li>

<p>Danny:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove someone’s “gut” and they give better predictions</li>
<li>Ask not what is true, but what it’s true of.</li>
<li>Simple algorithms &gt; judgment on average.</li>
<li>Don’t focus on the recruits, but on the interviewers - remove their biases.</li>
<li>If mueller lyar lines can deceive us in something so simple, how can we comprehend the complex?
<ul>
<li><a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> → if you can recognize it you can avoid being deceived.</li>
<li>→ data science. “Oh nice result!” → nope it’s just an illusion. Learn to recognize.</li>

<p>Amos:</p>

  <title>The Road</title>
  <dc:creator>Cormac McCarthy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/the-road.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I felt like most of the book was hard to follow. All the flowery detail had themes in it I wanted to take something from but decided it wasn’t worth rewinding for. So I stuck high level to the dialogue.</li>
<li>The most powerful moment was the father saying “you’re not the one who has to worry about everything” and the boy replies, “yes I am”. He’s the one that has to worry because he’s going to survive while his dad dies.</li>
<li>His dad said he’d join his son in death, but didn’t tell his son to join him.</li>
<li>The father was a good scavenger, but there was a group following them the whole time and he never noticed.</li>
<li>survival is about movement. I think in many ways we’re all choosing to move somewhere. Gotta keep moving, or else you die. Even in a world filled with death, movement is life.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-07</p>
<ul>
<li>you’re not the one who has to worry about everything. → yes, I am. I am the one. → they hold the fire.</li>
<li>Theme: the conscience of a child. He saved his dad from becoming like the rest: savages.
<ul>
<li>A scared child offers to help.</li>
<li>A scared adult fights to survive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Child avoids going places that makes him scared.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-06</p>
<ul>
<li>there’s no certainty about anything expect death: “there’s no fathers and no book. They’re all dead” yet he doesn’t</li>
<li>Death is the only thing down the road for anybody</li>
<li>We carry the light.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-05</p>
<ul>
<li>as I reflect on the halfway point: there’s probably more about this book than initially seems.</li>
<li>The world he walks in is devoid of any law. Just tribes and loners walking the planes. That’s perhaps how people would operate if there’s no society.</li>
<li>Interestingly, human nature is such that it seeks tribes within societies. Teams to root for. Alliances at work. Political factions. In essence, we’re the same scavengers but dressed up somewhat because of these laws. But within the laws, we still do those base human things.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-04</p>
<ul>
<li>theme: kid saying let’s go vs dad saying let’s go.</li>
<li>#Theme: is killing yourself or a loved one better than suffering the horrors of being alive? <a href="../book-review/of-mice-and-men.html">Of Mice and Men</a> and Lenny’s fate.
<ul>
<li>Dad debating if he can kill his son</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can’t help people you want to help if you don’t have the resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions: - Where are they going? Why south? - Who are the factions? How do they know the factions?</p>
<p>2024-05-03</p>
<ul>
<li>what’s the difference between what never was and what never will be?</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-02</p>
<ul>
<li>you forget what you want to remember and remember what you want to forget</li>
<li>Dreams of men in peril should be of peril, otherwise they’re just mirages.
<ul>
<li>→ dream in reality.</li>
<li>Impossible to wake from the day dream.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Connections - rewire your brain</p>
<p>Core takeaways: - Book time for prospecting. Protect that time. - Lighten the mood, build a relationship.</p>
<p>Summary: - sales is about a relationship, not a vendor ship. It’s treating people kindly. Treating your employees the way you treat others. Matching offerings - Sales is much less about techniques. Focus on the value you offer. - Sales is an emotional game. - Give goals: give stuff to ppl. - Book of prospecting time and don’t let it move.</p>
<p>2024-05-01</p>
<ul>
<li>If nobody’s following you you’re just out for a walk</li>
<li>Lead with respect. Be others focused.</li>
<li>Take the I out of team. Build incentives to foster teamwork.</li>
<li>Be willing to walk away. This helps increase the value prop.</li>
<li>The most successful people are</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-30</p>
<ul>
<li>problem solving: the customer brings the symptoms but I need to diagnose</li>
<li>How committed is your prospect to getting change?</li>
<li>Four personalities
<ul>
<li>Driver. → get to the point.</li>
<li>Influencer: motivated by status</li>
<li>Steady Relaters: loyal. More methodological. → build a relationship. Avoids conflict. Prioritize relationship.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Clarify expectations. - Be clear. - Be assertive. - Make commitments.</p>
<p>Review how you interact with different personality styles</p>
<p>Have a truth telling convo with yourself - Why do you feel you’re not hitting your goals? - Check your assertiveness</p>
<p>How well do you make decisions? - if you’re not good at making decisions, you can’t expect your customers to make decisions</p>
<p>Agree and align: - find the truth. - Ask questions of inquiry <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> and <a href="../book-review/feeling-good-together.html">Feeling Good Together</a> - <a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> → agree with people. Get them to like you.</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<ul>
<li>People do business with people they like</li>
<li>Ask more talk less.</li>
<li>Three questions:
<ul>
<li>Why is this a problem?</li>
<li>What is it costing you right now?</li>
<li>What is it going to cost you if you don’t solve it?
<ul>
<li>Are your competitors figuring it out?</li>
<li>Will someone be fired?</li>
<li>Business dry up?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 2 - slow down. Build partnership. - <a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> - be deeply interested in others. - Each day focus on improving. - Stress tolerance: all this competition/recession will get rid of our competitors. - Top sales: create opportunities. - Humor to relieve stress. - People buy emotionally, Not logically</p>
<p>Make a decision - What are you doing? You need to focus.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 - price to value. Sell the value, not the price.</p>

<p>Follow-ups - Kluge by Gary marcus - stumbling upon happiness -</p>
<p>2024-05-09</p>
<ul>
<li>Rat brains → if you introduce intermittent reward, rats can push the button 1,000 times.
<ul>
<li>Slot machines: help win every 5-10. Then progressively slow it down over time until the person is empty. It’s manipulation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Habit: cue, routine, reward. <a href="../book-review/the-power-of-habit.html">The Power of Habit</a>. Keep the cue and reward equivalent, change the routine. Practice in your mind</li>
<li>Every victory is a mix of work and luck. Seek truth.
<ul>
<li>Self-serving bias: they messed up, I did great. I would have won every tournament if it weren’t for luck</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we’re more likely to reshape our perspective of the situation to have it conform to our own beliefs rather than accept the truth. #LossAversion <a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></li>
<li>Wanna bet on it? → forces you to think. If I say “I’m 60% confident citizen Kane won best picture”, it forces you to think why 60%. What’s 6/10? Perhaps - 6 times out of ten my gut gets such a thing right.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-29</p>
<ul>
<li>reactive vs deliberative brain.</li>
<li>Losses feels 2x as bad as wins. Losses are not costs.</li>
<li>I’m not sure → if there’s a 24% chance then that’s one of the 24/100 possible outcomes. And it happened.</li>
<li>Scale: 0 to 500. → really bad scale.</li>
<li>Life is more like poker than chess. Poker: you can do the best thing but there are so many things out of your control. Novices can win. Luck.
<ul>
<li>→ Ecclesiaates.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Reduce overfitting by getting more quality data</li>
<li>Augment your data (Mixups) to prevent overfitting.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-30</p>
<ul>
<li>Lottery ticket hypothesis: take a full model and prune it down to get the same performance. Reweight. Rebalance. Simplify. Iterate. The multiple things.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-29</p>
<ul>
<li>when doing image classification you 1) label the data and 2) create batches of support sets and query sets, 3) training episodes where you update and reweight the embedding a best classify the query set classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-18</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<ul>
<li>you can unsupervise learn something by adding noise to the truth and minimizing the distance in the embeddings between truth and noisy truth and maximize distance from something else.</li>
<li>Transfer learning: one general model, then update the target variable and dataset for a smaller model.</li>

  <title>Power and Prediction</title>

<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>point vs systemic shift. The book largely focuses on how AI will be used for systemic shifts. Those who embrace it, like those who embraced electricity over steam power, will have to reinvent their businesses from the ground up. They should do so by thinking about The core principles of their business and what’s a judgment and what’s a decision. They can become far more efficient by abandoning rules and procedures and instead focus on decisions. They can automate certain decisions using data.</li>
<li>Those who go to market to collect data first have a huge advantage. It’s the reason Google has outperformed Bing for a decade - it gets better data and feedback and uses that to make the product more efficient. Data collection is essential to a great data product - not only the data you begin the project with, but the data that brings it to life.</li>
<li>What will I do differently? I’ll try to think more systemically about how organizations I work in are operated by human judgment that can be automated. The book provides a framework for approaching such systemic shifts.</li>
<li>I’m also interested to see what they’d write about today’s day and age, as this was published right as ChatGPT came out and is now changing a lot. That being said, I think the main principle of decomposing the business into its central parts still stands as the thesis of the book. There’s also a big difference between Generative AI and predictive AI (machine learning). Gen AI is now going to unlock a whole lot of applications, but the principles still remain the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-15</p>
<ul>
<li><p>prediction va judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>Flywheel of AI. Feedback data is the most important.</p></li>
<li><p>Thinking in bets. →. Luck vs bad decision</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize weather forecasts. Get up earlier</p></li>
<li><p>Flint lead pipes. Political judgment stalled work</p></li>
<li><p>Prediction vs judgment systems. Need to create a new system to handle probabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>AI windfall - one sure gets more efficient and causes issues upstream</p></li>
<li><p>Algorithmic bias can be solved because it can be examined.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Who should decide? - Information - skills - Incentives - Coordination</p>
<p>Redesign the company from an AI systemic view: - judgment and decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who sees what vs who decides what.</li>
<li>Rules vs decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-13</p>
<ul>
<li>power is scarcity. AI power?</li>
<li>Those with power prevent system changes. But those who adopt systemic shifts will disrupt those who are stuck in the old ways.</li>
<li>systemic shifts. Companies need to rethink their businesses around AI. What can change? What’s too prohibitive to change? How do regulations change?</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-13</p>
<ul>
<li>airports: a decision. Security. Risk ca reward.
<ul>
<li>Highest security is manually reviewing all things.</li>
<li>Allow the machine to review things with some probability of missing a knife.</li>
<li>Let everyone in.</li>
<li>Cost: how much time people spend.</li>
<li>Costs: a plane crashing into another building.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rules vs decisions.
<ul>
<li>Rules are pre-determined or general decisions instead of making them personalized and relevant in the moment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-12</p>
<ul>
<li>the between time. Lightbulb took 20 years before 50% of houses had it.
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Point solutions
<ul>
<li>lower cost of power. No change to factory system</li>
<li>Can improve a single procedure without changing the system which embeds it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Application
<ul>
<li>Individual electric drives on each machine. Swappable. If one stops it doesn’t stop the others. Modularity the factory but still keep it the same layout.</li>
<li>Can enable a single thing to do more things.</li>
<li>Enables a new procedure without changing the system in which it’s embedded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>System solutions → change how the system is designed → steam vs electricity. Exploit by decoupling power source from factory element. → layout the machine how it’s supposed to and get the power to where it is.
<ul>
<li>Enables new procedures or changes existing procedures by changing dependent procedures.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Ai point solution: - improves a single decision without affecting other decisions AI Application solution - Enables new decision or changes how a decision is made without affecting other solutions AI system solution - Improves or enables new decisions only if changes to how decisions are made is implemented</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<ul>
<li>prediction: concert information you have to information you need</li>
<li>Ripe for adoption (business and customers are already familiar with risky decisions.) system shift: needs to change how people do things to be more efficient.</li>
<li>Randomized</li>

I'm on my way to get 52 books read this year. I think I can do it. 

But it's not to finish 52 books. It's to read two hours of fifty two books. Why?

Because of compounding interest. One book doesn't level you up. But multiple books over time will affect you for a long while to come. 

If you improve just 1% each day for 365 days, and that improvement compounds, then you'll have improved 37x over a year. (invest $100 and gain 1% each day and reinvest that money is $137 by the end of the year).

So don't worry what any one book gives you. Just keep investing. A few will pay off big, and the many "wasted" will have little downside.

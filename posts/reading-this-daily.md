#SundayThoughts Six weeks ago I stopped listening to podcasts in the morning and started listening to The Book of Mormon. 

Perhaps this book doesn't do it for you. If so, there are other scriptures or ancient philosophy texts that teach good principles. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is a good one. 

Listening to this timeless, ancient book every day has helped center me. It's reminded me of God's timetable. Of God's intervention in the course of human nature. And of God's unending love for us as His children. 

How do I listen? I picked a theme: Revelation. I took notes every day on what the 10-30 minutes taught me about that theme. Now I'm working on the theme of "patience". 

Having this more-constant anchor in my life helps me remember what's important each day. I feel a little bit more confidence and centered perspective each day I start with this practice.

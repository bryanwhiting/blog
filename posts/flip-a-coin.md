Assume you flip a coin 5 times and get heads 5 times. You're going pretty well!

But are you? 

A normal coin has 50% chance of heads. Chances of 5 heads in a row is ~3/100. It's not nothing. But over time this will average to 50%, if you flip 10000 times. 

Decisions are rarely black and whites despite how we choice to say "that was a bad decision". The outcome doesn't determine the quality of the decision. 

You chose to flip a coin, and not roll a dice. You didn't roll a 32 sided die either. 

Focus on choice that maximize probability. This is the decision.

I spent two years in Honduras as a representative for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.md).

I traveled. I spoke in Spanish. I learned the deepest heartaches of humanity in the most impoverished and destitute areas on earth. 

Regardless of pains suffered: robbery, infidelity, malnourishment and much more - I saw many healed by [The Miracles of Christ](../christianity/the-miracles-of-christ.md).

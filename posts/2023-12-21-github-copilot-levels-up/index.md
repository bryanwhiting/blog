## TL;DR: 
:::

{{< video https://youtu.be/SZVCJRUADc4?si=ocLYCwb9J4Tmzglm >}}

- can debug failed terminal errors 
- shows git diff of revisions 
- can explore workspaces now with @workspace (still lags behind Cursor, which indexes everything in your code base)
- auto-commit messages (I'll take this)
- auto-pr messages (sounds good to me)

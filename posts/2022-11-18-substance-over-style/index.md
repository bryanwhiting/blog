Earlier in my career I got feedback from a prospective recruiter telling me my resume was “visually imbalanced”. Of course, the recruiter wanted my business. 

But I went on to get over 70 interviews with that same template. I got a job at FAANG and a top startup using that resume template. I haven’t changed it. 

# Takeaway

How you write your resume and what’s on it will take you farther than how you design it.

I’ve been trying a Pomodoro timer in TickTick and it’s changing how I approach my work day. I’ve been using it for two days so far and here are the differences I notice:

* When my mind knows I’ll get a break at 25 minutes, it allows me to focus more. 
* It’s easier to say not to slack messages or impulses to open the news if I know I’ll have time for those things later. 
* A 5 min break is perfect. 
* If a distraction pops up, I write it down in my journal and tell myself I can follow up during my break. 
* 25 minutes is short. It’s amazing how time flies.

I used to hate timing myself after working in consulting. I vowed I would never work on the clock ever again. But don’t the best athletes pace themselves? Any marathon trainer knows how to set a pace and have rest periods. Why wouldn’t the same principles apply to cognitive work?

I once bought a pair of socks offering a lifetime warranty: if they ever rip or get a hole I can get a replacement!

I'm still trying to find them to see if they have any holes yet. 

In the meantime I found a new solution: I take 6 pairs of random assortments of old puma socks from Costco. I wait in line for 3 hours to return them and then I get a new pack of 6. 

Nothing better than a fresh pair of socks.

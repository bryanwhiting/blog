Things I like/dislike about `quarto` are listed [here](quarto-feature-requests/index.md). 

Generally, I love `quarto` and the main thing I don't like about quarto is how slow it is, compared to say, `hugo`. 

I looked heavily into `quartz`, which is explained [here](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/) as a way to publish your Obsidian vault on GitHub. And [here's an example](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/) of a digital garden someone uses with `quartz`, it's pretty slick. Here are the [features of quartz ](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features). 

Why `quarto`? I really like the design of a blog, as I tend to think better in "post" form rather than never-ending-garden-of-thoughts. I like reading blogs because I assume the thoughts are complete. Quartz is great if you just want your own wiki. I just don't really care about the network graphs and all and I don't think other people reading them care either. 

I want to focus on writing and sometimes long form writing. Quarto enables a lot, is easy to setup and customize, has great search, has a ton of markdown desires (tabs, callouts, asides, footnotes), can render code (Python/R) when I want to be adventurous, and has a blog interface for posts. 

Largely they're the same, and maybe I'll use quartz at some point. But I'm happy where I am now.

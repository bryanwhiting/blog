Foster talent by:

- creating stress free environment 
- finish before they're tired
- don't pamper them at the country club
- treat them for 10 minutes after 
- no need to teach. Kids will figure it out
- people who are great don't necessarily love what they do, but those who love what they do will be great

I love it. 

This is probably good management advice in any capacity.

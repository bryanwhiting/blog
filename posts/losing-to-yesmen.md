In a scene in [Dune](../book-review/dune.md), Paul notices that his warrior turns into his worshipper. He laments the loss, wondering if his non-religious warrior will be lost too.

Being a worshipped means you're worshipped. Unchallenged. Can do no wrong. As such, you're left with the intellect of one.

As a leader, you need to avoid worshippers. People who fail to challenge you out of fear or an abundance of praise. This all has to do in the decisions you make as a leader. The culture you decide to build. Is every voice heard, or does one voice rule them all?

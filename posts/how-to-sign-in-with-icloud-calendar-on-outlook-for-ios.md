How do I add an iCloud account to iOS Outlook without it being a public calendar?

It was easy to add any gmail accounts but I didn't know how to add my iCloud calendar to iOS Outlook. Part of the issue is my iCloud account is actually my gmail email address so I can't sign in with this or it'll load my gmail calendar. 

Solution:

- go to iOS settings > iCloud > get your `@icloud.com` name. If you use your gmail account for iCloud there's still this `@icloud` account. 
- Attempt to log into iOS Outlook calendar. Apple will then make you create an app-specific password for iOS Outlook 
- Use this password. 

Done. Pain solved.

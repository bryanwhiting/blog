It doesn't take 30 years to plan a good life. It's actually quite simple and if you sit down for 5 minutes you can figure out the following:

- do you like where you're at? Heading? No? Where do you want to go? Why? What do you need to change to get there?

That's it. 

No fancy grand vision. No elaborate planning. Just maybe 15 minutes to plan ahead. 

The speed of planning is 0.01% of the effort required to execute. "We're going to the moon by the end of the decade". Plan. Done. Execution is hard. 

Ideas are fleeting. Plans are changeable. Plans and ideas aren't the IP of your company. It's the people and the execution. Thats the hard part.

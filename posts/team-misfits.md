I once played a game of pickup basketball with my football captain. He was a linebacker. All state. And got drafted to play in college. He was an incredible athlete. 

But he moved like a clunky robot while playing basketball and couldn't make a layup for his life.

Sometimes that's how we are. As leaders, we should aim to help find where the misfits thrive.

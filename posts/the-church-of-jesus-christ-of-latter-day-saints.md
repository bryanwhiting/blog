The church I've been a part of since the early nineties. 

It's a Christian church (notice Christ in the name), sometimes referred to as "the Mormon church", because we have a powerful book called [The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ](../concepts/the-book-of-mormon-another-testament-of-jesus-christ.md), which is compiled by an ancient prophet named Mormon. (Like the book of Matthew, or John, it's named after the author.) 

I'm baptized, I'm an ordained deacon, priest, and elder, I've graduated from a four year seminary, and spent two years as a missionary ([my mission](my-mission.md)).

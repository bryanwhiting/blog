The hardest thing about looking at charts is the "nothings changed" bias our minds are prone to. It requires a ton of energy to look at each chart with new eyes every time. 

This is actually where AI can help point out things. But then there's the fatigue of starting to ignore AI read outs. 

Then move to anomaly detection 

But what if there are always a ton of anomalies. 

Then go back and make sure you read every chart. Every week.

"Avocado and turkey over ciabatta, it's a delicious way to start your day and fills you up for about six hours."

That last part - six hours...I had never heard such a sales pitch from a deli person in my life.

But it's the perfect sales pitch. Because I care how full I'm going to get off a $13.00 breakfast sandwich. But he just amortized the cost for me - implicitly stating it's only $2.16/hr for 6 hours. 

Would I pay $2 to not be hungry for an hour? I'm not sure what other snack (maybe a .60c banana) can fill me up for an hour. 

Genius.

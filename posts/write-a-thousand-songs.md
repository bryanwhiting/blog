I listened to an interview with Imagine Dragons. The lead singer talked about how he writes several songs per day.

No wonder he's so successful. Repetitions breeds opportunity.

This has two affects on the brain. 1) lowers the pressure of individual songs. Don't need to knock it of the park. 2) you get better at writing that much faster.

I heard once about a photography that let one half of the students only take 5 photos in a semester. The other half had to take 100. Which group had the better photos?

How do you get a job in data science if you currently aren't a data scientist?

I asked this question while working as an analyst 8 years ago and wanting to break into data science. I wrote about it back then (lost the post), so I'm gonna revisit it now. 

I was asked this question today: "how do I get started and get a job in data science if I don't have any experience?"

Simple: get experience. For free. In 10 weeks. Write a good resume. Network like crazy - try to connect with real people (and not just spam).

There are a million ways to do this, and a million blog posts like this one. But here's my biased opinion, so enjoy!

# Mindset

While doing the following, on weeks 2-10, write one blog post to outline what you learned. 

1) Where did you start? Why was it hard to learn? What did you want to know? 
2) What concepts were new to you? 
3) Do something with that knowledge. Search the internet to find data you can write about. 

If you don't get very far, just move on to the next topic. Breadth is better early on to find out what you enjoy. Don't get caught up in the details. Skim more. Write more. Worry less. You got this. 

In all things, use ChatGPT to tutor you. Ask it questions. Be relentless. Have it explain things to you like you're five. 

Balancing learning between real books and ChatGPT is the best combo. ChatGPT is a better teacher, and the books have real info in them you can more fully trust. Using both together will get you there faster. 

If any of the books below don't vibe for you, there are a million free books out there. Find a simpler one and the same topic (and post in the comments so I can add it!)

# Week 1: Prepare to Share

> By creating a blog you demonstrate the following: you like to learn, you can communicate, you can do hard things, you're naturally curious, you're contributing to the ecosystem. Lots of ways to show those things, but having a blog is at least one way. 

- Set up a blog. 
	- Medium.com
	- Substack.com
	- (Harder) Or use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and publish on GitHub
- Find 5 blogs by top data scientists. Read their posts. See what they write about. 
- Your first blog post is about what you like about these 5 blogs. 
- Share your blog post on all social media. LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook. 

# Week 2: Storytelling

> You can't get credit for great data science work unless you can tell a story. Now that you have a blog, learn how to write about data. 

- [Telling Stories with Data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/)
- Find three data-focused blogs that use charts and analysis. Economist, FiveThirtyEight, DataIsBeautiful, etc. 

# Week 3: Analytics

> To be able to make predictions about the future, you first need to understand how to understand the past.

- [Python for Data Analysis, 3E](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) - written by the creator of `pandas`
- [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) - written by the creator of `dplyr`, the best data manipulation language ever. 

Both these books are great. Read both. It's good to learn early that there are multiple right ways of doing your analysis the wrong way ðŸ˜‰. Seeing how to think in two languages is actually easier than getting stuck on one. 

# Week 4: Data Visualization

> Learning how to make a plot is like learning how to write. Learn how colors work. When to use them. When to use a bar vs. a line chart. How to make ideas shine. 

- [Visualization Curriculum](https://jjallaire.github.io/visualization-curriculum/)
- [R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd edition](https://r-graphics.org/)

This is after analytics because analytics is more important (knowing what to look for and how to think about data) than plotting it.

There are two types of plots: those for you to learn from and those for others to learn from. First, learn what's in the data. Learn for yourself. 

> "Look at the plot. Look at the plot. No seriously, look at the plot."
> Chris Peterson, Capital One

Second, plot for other people. After you've learned something by sifting out all the noise, learn how to communicate that externally.

Beautiful plotting is really hard and time consuming. Details can take hours. Focus on the basics at first. The simplest plot focuses on "what's the one thing I want someone to take away from this?"


# Week 5: Intro to Machine Learning

> This book nails the foundations of machine learning. Doesn't get too mathy, but teaches you the principles. 


- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
- For reference, a more mathy and dense book that supports the Intro book is [Elements of Statistical Learninf](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf)

# Week 6: Regression Analysis

> Regression Is key to getting insights out of data. It's what sets you apart from a data analyst role. 

- [Welcome | Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics: With Examples in R, Python and Julia](https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/)
- [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/)

# Week 7: Time Series Data

> All modern data is time series data in some way (data collected over time). Even though you may not use forecasting in everything or what not, understanding the nature of that data will set you apart. Focus on principles, not techniques as you may not use these specific techniques.

- [Forecasting: PrinciplesÂ andÂ Practice (3rdÂ ed)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)

# Week 8: Intro to Deep Learning

> Deep learning is all the rage, and will change the future for everyone. 

- [fast.ai - fast.aiâ€”Making neural nets uncool again](https://www.fast.ai/)
	- Great courses that teaches you how to build ChatGPT and Image Generators and understand it. 

# Week 9-10: Do two projects

Now that you've studied analytics, data viz, regression, machine learning, and deep learning, create two blog posts or personal projects. 

- Build a dashboard using a Jupyter notebook that updates daily. You can host on GitHub using quarto to render the notebook and use GitHub actions to update it every day. 
- Create a model to predict who will win the next NBA game
- Analyze any data from data.gov 

# Prepare your Resume

Now you've got 10 blog posts, which is 10 more bullet points on your resume than you had before you started. You've learned a ton if you only do 10% of all that's above. 

I've loved the advice I found written up here: [Writing a Tech Resume](2022-11-18-writing-a-tech-resume/index.md).

Once you have a good resume, find real people to give it to. Dont apply blindly online. Talk to everyone you know. Find people on LinkedIn and message them directly with a personal message. Use one of your blog posts in your message to tell them why you're a good fit for their role. Perhaps even write a blog post specific to data from their company!

Good luck!

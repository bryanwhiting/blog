* Shorter work is better. Less to edit. Less mistakes. Keep it simple.

# Distractions

* Block 30 min for email and review team members work twice a day.
* Aggressively filter email spam.

# Analysis

* Start with a story. End with story.
* Iterate quickly with stakeholders.
* always have one nights sleep before sending a presentation. Edit.

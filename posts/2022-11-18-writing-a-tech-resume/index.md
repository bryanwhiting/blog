## TL;DR: Use the ‚ÄúAccomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]‚Äù format. 
:::

Writing resume is painstaking, but let me help jumpstart you. My resume below has gotten me dozens of interviews with top tech companies (Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Waymo, LinkedIn, Hopper, etc). 

It got me in the door, but let me be clear I didn‚Äôt pass most of those interviews üòù. That‚Äôs the point of the resume: open the door. 

Let me help you get in the door. 

# My template

Here‚Äôs the google doc link to my [resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n8W79UBiWYhMWHeF4sNDtwaWxySRwU3t9isodbUuycI/view), also posted below.

You can copy this template and put in your own content. 

I designed and wrote my resume the way I did by following the guidance of these resources:¬†

* Blog: [Google‚Äôs Accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z formula](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140929001534-24454816-my-personal-formula-for-a-better-resume/)‚Ä®

# Commentary

* It takes some practice, but the XYZ formula is very powerful. 
* Emboldening words can be helpful to people who have 3 minutes to scan your resume.
* I‚Äôve never gotten commentary on how long my resume is or crammed. I‚Äôm guessing people just glance for a few keywords and some decent content and assume the rest of the resume is good. 
* I‚Äôve had a lot of discussions in phone calls about my Personal Projects sections. Fellow techies all have their own personal projects and they want to know about mine. It sends a signal you‚Äôre intrinsically motivated. 
* While my resume is long-ish, I try to think: what story does this bullet point tell? What story am I trying to convey?

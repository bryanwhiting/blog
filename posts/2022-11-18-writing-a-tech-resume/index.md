## TL;DR: Use the “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]” format. 
:::

Writing resume is painstaking, but let me help jumpstart you. My resume below has gotten me dozens of interviews with top tech companies (Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Waymo, LinkedIn, Hopper, etc). 

It got me in the door, but let me be clear I didn’t pass most of those interviews 😝. That’s the point of the resume: open the door. 

Let me help you get in the door. 

# My template

Here’s the google doc link to my [resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n8W79UBiWYhMWHeF4sNDtwaWxySRwU3t9isodbUuycI/view), also posted below. 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n8W79UBiWYhMWHeF4sNDtwaWxySRwU3t9isodbUuycI/view

You can copy this template and put in your own content. 

I designed and wrote my resume the way I did by following the guidance of these resources: 

* Blog: [Google’s Accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z formula](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140929001534-24454816-my-personal-formula-for-a-better-resume/)
* YouTube Video: [Google’s How to write a resume](https://youtu.be/BYUy1yvjHxE)
* Blog: [Cracking the Coding Interview: how to write a resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume)

# Commentary

* It takes some practice, but the XYZ formula is very powerful. 
* Emboldening words can be helpful to people who have 3 minutes to scan your resume.
* I’ve never gotten commentary on how long my resume is or crammed. I’m guessing people just glance for a few keywords and some decent content and assume the rest of the resume is good. 
* I’ve had a lot of discussions in phone calls about my Personal Projects sections. Fellow techies all have their own personal projects and they want to know about mine. It sends a signal you’re intrinsically motivated. 
* While my resume is long-ish, I try to think: what story does this bullet point tell? What story am I trying to convey?

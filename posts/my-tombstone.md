They call it a death meditation, to look back from the end of your life and reflect as if you had just died (out of body style). Here's my tombstone:

> Here lies Bryan, son of Aragon, data scientist extraordinaire who knew how to use regular expressions and properly test linear regression assumptions

Seem like a good tombstone?

Why do we measure our lives by something nobody cares about? Consider Steve Jobs, Isaac Newton, or whomever you idolize. What are they known for? Only a few things. 

I read [Steve Jobs (Biography)](../book-review/steve-jobs-biography.md) a while back. And I also read [Leonardo da Vinci](../book-review/leonardo-da-vinci.md). First was 25 hours, second was 17 hours. And guess what - that's less than two days combined. Two "impressive" lives summed up in a few days. 

My grandma's obituary was brief. Yet her life was filled with millions of unwritten sentences - many written on my life. The in between moments. The laying around moments. The relationship moments. (Maybe it's called a relation-"ship" because it sails the waters of life continuously, despite the infrequent dock postings.)

Nobody's going to remember me, except those who call me dad, husband, brother, son, and friend. And I'm okay with that. I was never that good at data science anyway ðŸ˜‰.

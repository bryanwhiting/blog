The easiest ways to learn how do to something better:

- do something for the first time 
- Do something 1000 times. You get better over time. 
- Mess up doing something: this is how you realize your initial assumptions were wrong and you overcome beginners luck. 
- Do something fast: You see what you do more efficiently. 
- Do the same thing with new inputs: serve a new customer, try on new shoes for walking. 
- Watch someone do the same thing you've done 50 times: you have all the context and you're primed to observe new ideas. 

This is life experience, it turns out. Doing a lot of stuff on repeat, watching others do it, mess up doing it, or do it slightly differently...

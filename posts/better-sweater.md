I have this fleecy sweater jacket that is warm and cozy - until a 2 mph gust of wind hits it. Then all bets are off. 

Made by a fancy outdoor apparel company, I expected more. That when they tested it they should have at least tested it...outside. 

Then it dawned on me: there's no wind in an office. 

Well. There's us one type of wind but it's always 96 degrees.

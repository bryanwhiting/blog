I’ve had less meetings and more unstructured time during WFH. It can be isolating, which can slow down productivity.

[Here’s a tip I read](https://link.medium.com/6xW8fKHSfcb) today on how to be productive with unstructured time: put your to-do list directly into a calendar.

That way, you’ll always have time for the important things. Remove the things that take up your time and aren’t as important. I like it.

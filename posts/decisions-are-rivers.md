Reading [how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices](../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.md) and thinking about decisions. 

I like to think of decisions as rivers.

Like decisions, all rivers lead somewhere. Where is your river heading?

The decision is which river to get on in your little boat. You can only envision the destination. 

Being a high school English teacher is a decision. Where will that life take me after 5/10/20 years? Is that appealing? Only I can choose. 

This thinking process is the decision choice. The rest is up to luck.

There's a fun $75,000 purse for the winner of the World's Longest Drive. 

These guys are averaging 400y in contest, which is an attempt to drive straight. This guy wins (ofc) but his first round is the best. 432.

Apparently the record is 515 set in 1974 by Mike Austin, a 64 year old. 

1. It's kind of crazy that since 1974 the record for longest drive hasn't been broken. 
2. Tech helps, but old school can sometimes be the way. Form over gear all day. 

But Berkshire broke that record per his Instagram account. Here's the full scoop:

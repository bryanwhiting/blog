I remember in 2014 deciding whether to leave my startuo after having just helped raise a seed round and finish a highly successful kickstarter. It was either: move with the team to Seattle or stay and finish my Master's degree. My married cofounder even suggested "you could find your wife here!"

I imagined every scenario in my anxiety. I specifically imagined all of my partners making $1M dollars or something. I felt like the decision to leave was a decision to not be a millionaire. 

I emotionally came to terms with that possibility. And suddenly, that possible outcome had no allure to me anymore. 

I chose to finish my degree and pursue a career in data science. I also luckily found my wife *not* in Seattle just a few weeks later. 

I've made this choice a few times in my life: go with the direction I want to go at that time. To hop on the right [river](decisions-are-rivers.md). 

This was the right decision, because I came to terms with alternate realties and still chose what aligned with my goals.

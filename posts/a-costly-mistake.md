"This is the moment I've been waiting for"…until it wasn't.

Several years ago as a budding data scientist I got excited by using a massive compute cluster. This is it. This is when I get to do Big Data Science, baby!

A few thousand dollars later, I realized my hundred-dollar-an-hour cluster wasn't doing the thing I hired it to do. 

My patient manager David Mantilla ssh'd into my cluster and discovered that out of the 64 cores I paid for, I was using only 1.

A good manager goes a long way. He just laughed as I stared in horror at my gross misconduct. 

Be kind to the noobs. Because you still are one in many ways…

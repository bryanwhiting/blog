I use these seven steps to the scientific method every single day:

1. Whatâ€™s the problem?
2. Hypothesis: Whatâ€™s the believed answer? 
3. Metrics: how do I measure with data?
4. Methods: how do I test the belief?
5. Findings: what are the unemotional facts?
6. Discussion: what are my opinions about the findings? (These are usually more hypotheses.)
7. Next steps: self explanatory ðŸ¤£

It helps me think more clearly when diving into data! Hope it helps.

  <title>I’m Grateful for Explorers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/explorers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-wager.html">The Wager</a> right now and am enthralled and saddened by the horrible circumstances people had to go through on boats back in the day.</p>
<p>Without explorers, we wouldn’t have the knowledge of the world that we have now.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the freedoms we enjoy now, as most of us don’t have to fear about body snatchers coming to take us on a ship and force us to work until we die.</p>
<p>It’s the simple things, I guess…</p>

<p>The Scottish man you’re referring to is Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean, now known as Robinson Crusoe Island, part of the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile. Selkirk lived alone on the island from 1704 to 1709. His story is believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe’s novel “Robinson Crusoe.” Selkirk was a skilled navigator and sailor, and his survival skills, including hunting, gathering, and shelter building, allowed him to survive until he was eventually rescued by an English ship. His experience highlights the human capacity for adaptation and survival in extreme conditions.</p>

  <title>Trajectory and Mindset</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/trajectory-and-mindset.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tony Robbins has said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are. <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/tony-robbins-quotes/">Tony Robbins Quotes, Read These Famous Quotes from Tony Robbins</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book <a href="../book-review/mindset.html">Mindset</a> talks about “fixed” vs “growth” mindsets. My post <a href="../posts/decisions-are-rivers.html">Decisions are Like Hopping on a River Raft</a> - decisions take you down to known endpoints.</p>
<p>Bring those two concepts together and on one hand there’s a trajectory - where you’re capable of going given your decisions (and mindset) and your mindset - how you perceive your circumstances.</p>
<p>Someone recently told me, “It’s not what you go through but how you perceive what you’re going through that matters.”</p>
<p>I believe perception is powerful. Any negative situation can be reframed for a positive. This is mindset.</p>
<p>But the other component is also important: where your circumstances will take you if pursued every day for the next 30 years.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-mountain-in-a-mountain-range.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Are you aimed toward the valley or the mountain? Neither is better, but one is probably better to you</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If you’re an extremely happy person but you don’t take action to get out of a minimum wage job, such as spend time on self improvement, you’re going to stay in your minimum wage job (nothing wrong with that, just trying to illustrate a point).</p>
<p>And so, to get what you want out of life you can’t just assume things will get better without any change on your part. You can 1) change your mindset or 2) change your trajectory.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered whether at times in my career I was complacent or not, or whether I was growing doing what I was doing. That’s not a helpful question. Because if you’re too myopic you can miss that you doing your multiplication tables isn’t going to change anyone’s life, but if you can’t do multiplication you can’t be a machine learning engineer.</p>
<p>Most days in our work are steps. Steps towards something.</p>
<p>A spaceman can’t land on the moon unless they build a rocket. They won’t make a rocket unless they choose to land on the moon. And by choosing the moon they’re choosing to <em>not</em> open a Chinese restaurant.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Some roles have upper bounds. Staying at that upper bound isn’t a bad thing. It’s just a thing. Other roles open up different opportunities the longer you stick around, opportunities you won’t get else where perhaps.</p>
<p>So if you’re feeling stuck, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will I be if I stay with this for the next two years?</li>
<li>Is that directionally where I want now to head?</li>
<li>Is there something about my mindset I can change today to help me reframe so that I don’t miss the opportunities already around me?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTH.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Who has more impact? Well as cool as it is to land on the moon, it doesn’t actually do anything practically useful. A restaurant prevents millions of people from starving throughout its existence.↩︎</p></li>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Foam Mattresses</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/foam-mattresses.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Bed in a box. It’s all the rage.</p>
<p>It shows up on your porch. You lug it upstairs, cut it open, unravel it and poof: you have a bed.</p>
<p>The first time we got a foam mattress was in 2017. It changed our life.</p>
<p>Anytime I travel I always wish I was home. Nothing like a long nights sleep in a reasonably priced, highly comfortable, never sagging, bed in a box mattress.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I once played a game of pickup basketball with my football captain. He was a linebacker. All state. And got drafted to play in college. He was an incredible athlete.</p>
<p>But he moved like a clunky robot while playing basketball and couldn’t make a layup for his life.</p>
<p>Sometimes that’s how we are. As leaders, we should aim to help find where the misfits thrive.</p>

  <title>Coalesce - Revelation first, then Agency</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/coalesce-revelation-first-then-agency.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Some believe in pre-destiny. That their life is predetermined.</p>
<p>Some believe there is no God and they have to do the best they can with what they’ve got, because that’s all they’ve got.</p>
<p>The truth lies somewhere in between. There <em>is</em> a God, <em>and</em> He wants us to be agents (<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.28.html">Doctrine and Covenants 58.28</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-plan-a-and-b.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Life is filled with choices and many actions to perform"> In data science, there’s a concept called “coalesce”. In English it means to come together and make one whole. In software, it means to fill in missing data with a default value.</p>
<p>Forgive the nerd talk, but bear with me here: So if you have an empty spreadsheet, and you do the operation <code>coalesce(spreadsheet, 5)</code> it would return the spreadsheet’s value if you had data in the spreadsheet but the number 5 if you had a missing cell. So if you have 10 rows of data in Excel but 3 missing rows, the output would be the 7 original values with 3 cells now with 5 in them. It’s a way of handling missing data, because missing data creates problems.</p>
<p>What is the missing data in our personal lives? It’s “what do we do?” What do we do today? Tomorrow? Next year? What do we do today and tomorrow to prepare for the thing we may want to do next year?</p>
<p>I’ve realized the healthy way to have a relationship with personal revelation is to operate under the constraints of a coalesce. To be whole and one with the Lord, our goal should be to coalesce.</p>
<p>Some rely too much on the spirit. Hoping God will make a choice for us. But he gave us agency. He lost 1/3 of his children because he didn’t want to give up agency. And, by that right, he’s willing to lose you and me too if we’re not willing to exercise our agency. We just choose. This is life. And we must choose Him.</p>
<p>In many things, there is a commandment we can rely on. Don’t kill. Don’t steal. Be honest. Pay tithing.</p>
<p>That’s the priority.</p>
<p>Then there’s the gray area stuff: love our neighbor.</p>
<p>That’s the agency.</p>
<p>Then there’s the really gray area: have joy. Among this is “provide for a family” and “raise them the best way you can”.</p>
<p>So, use a coalesce. Your default value is what <em>you</em> want to do. That’s what you fill in.</p>
<p>Our life should be <code>coalesce(personal revelation, our agency)</code>.</p>
<p>Where there’s a commandment or personal revelation from the Lord, do it. Don’t wait. Do it. Follow the prompting. Otherwise, if you have no prompting or commandment to follow, make a choice! Learn. Experience. Enjoy.</p>
<p>I believe the Lord will support us when we follow a pattern of putting Him first, and then defaulting to doing many good things of our own free will and choice when He hasn’t given us instruction.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean he doesn’t care what we do. He cares deeply. It’s just more like <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23.html">Ether 2.23</a> where he wants us to come up with some good ideas.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 Ask</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-ask.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Do you believe in what Nephi came to know?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.35">2 Nephi 4.35</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the limitations we can put on the Lord? Here are a few that get me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord wants me to struggle on this one</li>
<li>I don’t want to ask too much</li>
<li>This isn’t that big of a deal. I should pray about more important things instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these are easily contradicted by scriptures. He <em>does</em> want us to struggle but struggle <em>with</em> him and overcome (<a href="../scriptures/1-corinthians-10.13">1 Corinthians 10.13</a>). The Lord wants us to ask for all the blessings He’s capable of giving us (<a href="../scriptures/malachi-3.10">Malachi 3.10</a>), and pour out endless blessings.<sup>1</sup> And lastly, the Lord works by small and simple means (<a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps instead those three things should be exactly what we pray for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can we struggle on together? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30.html">Matthew 11.28–30</a>)</li>
<li>What’s the gift that thou art willing to bless me with? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-6.8.html">Matthew 6.8</a> )</li>
<li>What’s the smallest piece of help I could possibly ask for? (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23">Ether 2.23</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase “ask not amiss” isn’t some indication that a secret code needs to be enacted. That to unlock the heavens, the prayer needs to be offered in the right way at the right time by the right person.</p>
<p>How can you ask amiss? The scriptures teach us. If we’re selfish, seek our own, are puffed up, are easily provoked, want revenge, are greedy, etc. then we’re asking amiss.</p>
<p>But if we’re trying to do our best to be good people and dealing with the challenging responsibilities of being a father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, neighbor, coworker, manager, etc. then we’re just dealing with life.</p>
<p>What is life without these titles? Who doesn’t work? Who doesn’t have someone to care for?</p>
<p>It’s precisely <em>these</em> things that are worthy of our prayers and divine supplication.</p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a> is a theme I’ve tried this year. I’ve grown deeply in finding healing by making sure I can have a private place to pray.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen how prayers have been answered in ways I didn’t expect. That something comes unexpectedly and it turns out to be really good. But it wasn’t in the plans.</p>
<p>This is kind of like a personal manna. God delivers. Not expected. But welcomed.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Chicken Sliders</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/chicken-sliders.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I sit down for lunch with a friend. The seat is leather. The booth is warm. The table is glossy with that restaurant-style gloss. And the paper in front of me invites me into a world of tasteful possibilities. The most appealing one is that of the chicken biscuit slider.</p>
<p>Moments later a plate of sliders appears next to a side of truffle fries. The aioli sauce invites a potato’s partnership. The crispy crunch of the fried chicken echos within the cavern of my bite. Eyes close. Satisfaction is earned.</p>

<p>Obviously war profits defense contractors. This isn’t anything new.</p>
<p>And putting aside beliefs about the war itself, I see the angle here as somewhat inauthentic. It assumes tech is somehow awful.</p>
<p>Arms dealers will always be in the race for selling more arms, whether in peace or in war. But providing services at a discounted rate to defend an invaded ally seems reasonable.</p>
<p>My point: I wish we had more positive tech news. Tech is how we won WWII and almost how we lost it. That same awful WWII tech is how we now power homes with cleaner energy across the world. Some argue it’s how we’ve avoided a WWIII so far because it’s a nuclear war is an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>Tech cannot control the hearts of the men and women who wield it. It can only enable them. May we all strive for wars of words and code not wars of people or weapons, and I actually think tech helps enable that. And hopefully, we can use tech to facilitate misunderstandings and bring people to better diplomacy, ending the need for war. But that’s up to the leaders. Desires for war rage within hearts long before those desires rage within bullets.</p>
<p>As for the main stream media, I’d hope for more nuanced discussions around the uses of tech. Perhaps that’s what it’s alluding to - that war mongers are being fueled by this war.</p>
<p>But then let’s get more diplomatic leaders into office that can manage peace talks. It’s a people problem. Our government shouldn’t be run by the war machine, but by the people. And tech will always enable the people to do what they do best: be human.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Enticement is Agency</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>What’s enticing you right now?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.16">2 Nephi 2.16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you make a decision without being presented at least two options?</p>
<p>If you feel like you made a decision on something, what did you decide and what was the alternative option?</p>
<p>If you’re torn about a decision, why? What’s on the other side?</p>

<p>Life is full of enticing things. Sometimes, self defeating thoughts can be enticing. We have a bias towards negativity as humans. But thankfully we always have a choice.</p>
<p>Recognize the behavior. And then find the perhaps less <em>enticing</em> but far more healthy thought pattern.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Gatherings for the Super Bowl</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/gatherings-for-the-super-bowl.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I remember a few fun memories of gathering with friends and family for the Super Bowl while growing up. Often there might be a contest, with random questions like “how long is the opening anthem going to be sung for: longer or shorter than 60s?” Fill out a page of such questions and the person with the most correct answers wins.</p>
<p>Football is a fun sport. I grew up playing it for nearly 12 years - from 2nd grade through senior year. There’s something about playing a sport for that long that you grow an experiential appreciation for what these guys can do.</p>
<p>I don’t follow football much, or any sport for that matter. I don’t have the patience for tracking who goes where. But I love playing it and, when the Super Bowl is on, watching it.</p>
<p>That’s the cool thing - even people who don’t care much for football enjoy watching the game.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Old Movies</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)">Casablanca (film) - Wikipedia</a> last night for the first time in 10 years. The writing. The angles. The one liners. The implementation of <a href="../posts/the-iceberg-theory-theory-of-omission.html">The Iceberg Theory - Theory of Omission</a>. There are so many cool things.</p>
<p>Great writing is timeless. What connects us to stories are the people that wrote them. The people in them. The Iliad is thousands of years old or whatever. Same with the Bible. They’re both written in language that doesn’t match modern times. But they’re still beautiful because of what they represent.</p>

<p><a href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx#">ImageFX</a> Is the tool to generate images with Google’s Gemini. I’ve been a huge fan of using ChatGPT on iOS to get images for this blog. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually good or not. But it’s helped me associate a post with an idea (image), which I think is incredibly helpful for memory retention. So my theory has been: some content is better than no content. The other thought is: better learn now what these tools are and how to use them because you never know where you’re going to be able to take them. They’re like learning how to drive a car: if you can drive, you can go places.</p>
<p>So how does ImageFX compare?</p>
<section id="battle-prompt" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Battle Prompt</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>a battle of chatgpt vs Google Gemini photo generators. Psychedelic. Parasitic. Enlightened. Groovy. Ethereal. Down to earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/google Vs chatgpt.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And ChatGPT:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-battle-chatgpt-vs-gemini.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">ChatGPt wins</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is but one test, and clearly chatGPT wins.</p>
</section>
<section id="fast-car-prompt" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Fast Car Prompt</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Image: sports car driving along the highway. Scenic. Photographic. Realistic. Focused camera, low aperture. Beach off in the distance. Windy roads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/Pasted image 20240210194755.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Gemini</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-sports-car.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Sports Car</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, ChatGPT added a camera <em>and</em> had the identical photo inside the camera’s viewport. I’m really not sure how LLMs are that capable, that’s some diffusion inside diffusion.</p>
<p>But winner goes to Gemini here! That nails the image best.</p>
<p>Also, Gemini has an editor that pops up that lets you swap out backgrounds or objects. Pretty neat!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-gemini-editor.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Photo editor</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="human" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Human</h1>
<p>Let’s see how they do on people.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Image: a seven year old brother and nine year old sister. The boy has brown hair, spiked. The girl has long curly blond hair. They’re on a swing-set together. The boy is jumping off the swing while the girl is on the swing but getting ready to. A creek and a grassy hill in the background.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-google-against-policies.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Against Google policies</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-two-kids-swinging.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Two kids Swinging</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT wins by TKO on this one. Gemini perhaps can’t generate images of kids? Not sure.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-battle-picturesque-landscape" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Final Battle: Picturesque Landscape</h1>
<p>Nothing better than a sunset, right?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sunset over the San Francisco Bay. Taken from the East, the Golden Gate Bridge is in visible. The sunset is bursting through a gentle fog, angle is taken from higher in the air, perhaps 1000 feet as if from a low helicopter view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/Pasted image 20240210200221.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-sf-sunset.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">SF sunset</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And a real photo taken from Google Images:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-get-your-guide-real-photo.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">What the sunset really looks like</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Winner here is Google Images search! Both of those photos are bad. ChatGPT nailed the fog, which Gemini omitted. Gemini is much closer to the mark but made up a city to the right. Both of them couldn’t produce the right angle for the sun. But hey, they’re both better than nothing!</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Gemini is here! I can now use it to create images from my phone.</p>
<p>As a consumer, I think the mobile experience of ChatGPT is really great. But if I’m on desktop I may use Gemini because it gives me four variations for each prompt. And it’s free. Can’t beat free.</p>
<p>But ChatGPT can do crazy things that Gemini can’t, such as the head to head battle.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Redemption</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-redemption.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Notice the words “in” and “through”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.6">2 Nephi 2.6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This provides some meaningful words. Rambling a bit here:</p>
<ul>
<li>in: because of?</li>
<li>through: by means of</li>
</ul>
<p>How are these two words different? One, Christ is a Being. He’s not an “amorphous entity”. By means of what He did for us, we can be redeemed. But it’s also because of who He is (presently as the Living Christ) in granting us forgiveness.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-risen-christ-by-the-tomb-redemption.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Risen Christ"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Christ’s atonement is infinite. It’s empowering to know that he’s already suffered for my sins of today and yesterday as well as tomorrow and beyond. Meaning, he already knows the mistakes I’m going to choose to make, which is kind of trippy in a way, but also comforting thinking about how He still loves me and knows how I’ll falter. That brings me peace knowing He knows me, who I am today, who I’ll develop into tomorrow.</p>

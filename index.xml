  <title>I’m Grateful for Better Health</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/better-health.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Having the flu stinks. I realized quickly this week how a life revolves around health. My ability to do my job, to be there for my family, and even enjoy sitting on the couch is all impacted by what’s going on inside my body.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is: when I’m sick, I only want to get better and I realize what’s most important. But as I get better, my mind focuses in equal proportion on the normal preoccupations of life and I perhaps focus less on the things I had just realized were most important.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for good health.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for CS Lewis</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/cs-lewis.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Probably and odd thing to be thankful for, but I’m grateful for this guy’s legacy. Having read <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> I decided to read <a href="../book-review/mere-christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve read a few things by Lewis and have enjoyed his writing. It’s also fun to better imagine him writing it when he was at Oxford in 1940’s.</p>
<p>His writing continues to influence millions. I’m grateful he chose to write what he did even though people around him didn’t want him to.</p>

<p>We use audience to bootstrap customers.</p>
<p>When we don’t have time to build an audience, we’ll partner with a creator. Give them a cut of the business.</p>
<p>Then we’ll create a little community of the power customers. Sometimes it’s just an iMessage group or WhatsApp group.</p>
<p>We limit who can come in. This is only for the people for the most excited audience members. Those who just are dying to be in a group of other like-minded people.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the feeling of Skimboarding</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-feeling-of-skimboarding.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I only had 10 minutes to skimboard today. But I saw this little flat spot off to the side, where the waves were receding slowly. It looked perfect.</p>
<p>First one or two were a bit slow. But then I started to pick it up again. Pretty soon I was running compulsively to the next wave, just like when I was 22 when I really learned.</p>

</div>
<p>Then I had a great run. Hit the crash of the wave as best as I’ve ever done it. Didn’t wipe out. Just a great, energizing feeling.</p>

<h1>Lesson</h1>
<p>Know: What the apostasy is. What a prophet is. Feel: that they’re alive at a special time. Do: ask Heavenly Father if this church is the true church. And keep asking.</p>
<p>Activity: - apostasy. - Every boy is a prophet. - They need to invite people to repent. Repent and come unto Jesus. - Everyone else throws things at them. - Ask: who would you rather be - the one listening or preaching? - Have a pause for one minute of silence for how long the time was that they didn’t have a prophet.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 27 The Purpose of the Book of Mormon</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-27-the-purpose-of-the-book-of-mormon.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>This chapter doesn’t lay about all the purposes of the Book of Mormon, but it lays out some.</p>
<p>Purpose: help people eat and be filled. The souls who aren’t fed are like hungry men who dream of eating but awake empty.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.3">2 Nephi 27.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book is a revelation. It’s a miracle in itself. It’s a witness of all things, and a testament of its translator.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.7">2 Nephi 27.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be a revelation of the doctrines that have been taught since the foundation of the world and will be taught until the end of it:<sup>1</sup></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.11">2 Nephi 27.11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence that this is the Lord’s work, because he turned a plow boy into a translator of a sealed book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.20">2 Nephi 27.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will do a marvelous work through this book. It’ll be the means of converting people to Him and His gospel:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.26">2 Nephi 27.26</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This teaches me that the Lord is doing His work. That I have a role in this work.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Freedom of Religion</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/freedom-of-religion.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for the freedom of religion. I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-happiest-man-on-earth.html">The Happiest Man on Earth</a> right now and cannot fathom the horrid experiences Eddie had to endure.</p>
<p>When we (as humans) start labeling and blaming groups of people for our problems, we begin dehumanizing them and they’re no longer worth anything to us. And if we have power, we can choose to destroy them.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how depraved humanity can become. It happened to the Germans, but it can happen anywhere. It happened in the U.S. with slavery and civil rights failures.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the freedom of religion. It hasn’t always been free. My ancestors were shot at in Missouri and driven from their home in Nauvoo to cross the plains in the winter with nothing but dirt to eat to pacify their hunger.</p>
<p>They crawled on their hands in the frozen tundra because it’s all they could do.</p>
<p>Some survived. But not all.</p>
<p>Today I enjoy freedoms they didn’t have. The freedom to not have to cross a frozen tundra on my hands and feet because I’m a member of <a href="../concepts/the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.html">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.</p>

  <title>How I Learn and How to Hack the Audio Book and Speed Reading Game</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/how-i-learn.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been overdosing slightly on learning lately.</p>
<p>Ever since I got off social media, I got into writing (<a href="../tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.html">A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media</a>), and listening to audio books.</p>
<p>Podcasts are fine, but they’re about as quality as top-of-mind thinking. Books are usually far more instructive because each sentence is reviewed at least a few times if not a hundred times during the editing process.</p>
<p>I noticed that once I started binging books instead of posts, my happiness and satisfaction increased.</p>
<p>Here’s a strategy I’m using for learning.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get Audible and Spotify subscriptions. It has books that aren’t available on Libby (which I also use).</li>
<li>Stock up on free books using Libby. Hold times vary, but can be a few weeks or months for popular titles. Note: you can supply multiple library accounts.</li>
<li>For short books not on Libby, check Audible free catalog. If it’s not in the Audible free catalog, check Spotify Premium listening, which is 15 hours per month. If you listen to short books on Spotify, you can get 2-3 books in 15 hours. (It’s 15 book hours, not listening hours.) Also, if your phone is locked, you can go beyond the 15 hours (don’t report this…). But once you re open the app the 15 hour limit will halt you. 2-3 books would otherwise be $20-45 dollars depending on the cost of the audio book. $12 for Spotify premium is a deal.</li>
<li>Use Audible credits for books you can’t find on Libby or Spotify. Remember, Audible is $15 per month. So don’t waste it on a $4 book. Buy the expensive books or &gt;15 hour books with the credits.</li>
<li>With all the cash savings, and if you still have time, now you can buy the remaining books you want on either Audible and Spotify.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most books are on Libby. Domain specific books and cutting edge releases books are on Audible. Lots of great in between books on Spotify Premium.</p>
<p>I don’t know why but after 50 books you get a sense for what books are going to be available where.</p>
<p>Lastly, on Chrome I use the SwiftRead extension for speed reading and on iOS the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/outread-speed-reading/id778846279">Outread</a> app.</p>

<p>Phrases</p>
<ul>
<li>fascism turns everyone into a slave. The slaves first. Then the captors who have no choice but to be a captor</li>
<li>Couldn’t even escape because he’d be shot at by other people who were afraid.</li>
<li>Why would you argue with a loved one? Argue instead with the person who litters. There’s no time for arguing with a loved one.</li>
<li>I chose to be the happiest man on earth. There could not be a sweeter revenge against people who wanted to take away everything</li>
<li>I don’t believe the world is only full of hate. I don’t blame any survivor who has that opinion. The are many who struggle like that. They were liberated from physical captivity but their hearts were broken.</li>
<li>just do good work. Take pride in doing meaningful work in your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-15</p>
<ul>
<li>he escaped and was shot at and returned</li>
<li>1 hour of rest is two days of survival. Conserving energy.</li>
<li>Running to the wire.</li>
<li>I could not have survived without friends. Without Kurt.</li>
<li>Shave heads to be free from lice.</li>
<li>Bromide in the coffee. Chemically castrate.</li>
<li>one louse meant the whole house to be burned.</li>
<li>Examined by the weight of your buttocks</li>
<li>The body is the best machine.</li>
<li>“Don’t you have a soul?” → he wasn’t so courageous when he was alone. He never hit me again.</li>
<li>My education saved me.</li>
<li>Where there is hope there is life.</li>
<li>I know many who took their own life when they were liberated because they had nothing to live for.</li>
<li>Hides in a sewage pipe.</li>
<li>Crawled out of a cave to a road.</li>
<li>Finds Kurt. Always a miracle.</li>
<li>Old anti semitic attitudes are hard to fade. “Greedy Jews” after he gets a job.</li>
<li>Sulfer baths.</li>
<li>Rescues 3 women from suicide. Duty of the fortunate to help the suffering. Simple act of kindness → saved the life of these women.</li>
<li>Found someone in his suit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happiness - you’ll never be happy with comparison. - Loved saved me. - Happiness comes from inside. Happiness doubles each time you share it.</p>
<p>2024-03-14</p>
<ul>
<li>Germans made a religion of logic, and it turned them cruel</li>
<li>The dichotomy that you could be fined 200 franks for littering a cigarette butt and yet they threw children into the river,</li>
<li>Crystallnacht. Broken glass.</li>
<li>What would have happened had he not returned home that night?</li>
<li>“I made the worst decision”. It’s what you say, but the decision itself to visit family was perhaps a good one. Resulting.</li>
<li>“Are you hungry?” → the French did the most to help Jews.</li>
<li>1936 for Spanish people leaving the Spanish civil war.</li>
<li>15,000 prison</li>
<li>Trains filled with fumes</li>
<li>Doctor who used a razor to suicide over a latrine</li>
<li>2.5 months to walk through France, to get caught while using the toilet. Parachuter.</li>
<li>Escape bottom of train. Week hopping on and off trains.</li>
<li>Train car with 44 liters of water for the whole train. His dad rationed 155 cups.</li>
<li>“go tell your mother how much you love her. Do it for your new friend, Eddie, who cannot”. Sent to gas chambers.</li>
<li>How could Hitler make enemies of friends, then civilized men into inhuman zombies. How could Hitler create such hate?</li>
<li>Go to sleep naked. Wake up with naked</li>
<li>Rags were more precious than gold.</li>
<li>Germans were detailed and record keepers, which made them killers.</li>

<p>It won’t be long before they don’t jump on me anymore. I can’t help but think of how quickly it’ll have all gone by.</p>
<p>But I do cherish it. The tackle time. The giggles. The tickles. They need it. I need it.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-26.20">2 Nephi 26.20</a></p>

<p>I think I’ve always assumed that Nephi saw the restoration and then saw the second coming. And that’s it. That’s kind of how it reads.</p>
<p>But as I ponder this I wonder how much he saw. Did he see 2024? Did he see what my people would be going through? Probably. Perhaps.</p>
<p>Assuming he did, and that this was written about today, what are the churches that have risen up to get gain? Probably people with pride in their heart.</p>

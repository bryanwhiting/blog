  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for In Awe of AI</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I‚Äôm grateful to be in awe of AI.</p>
<p>I went to makersuite.google.com and fed Gemini 1.5 a 115 page pdf investor report and it retuned a summary with core elements with page references.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for My work team</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/my-work-team.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Joining my current company has been pretty great. Here are the things I‚Äôve liked about it so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>people are kind.</li>
<li>They‚Äôre open to each other‚Äôs ideas.</li>
<li>They invite each other to lunch in big parties.</li>
<li>They laugh</li>
<li>They encourage each other</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs just a positive place. Where does this come from? It can only come from the top.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>, there‚Äôs a strong correlation between creative thinking and happiness. Having read things like <a href="../book-review/elon-musk.html">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="../book-review/steve-jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a> and one of the conclusions in the Elon book is ‚Äúworking for jerks is perhaps a necessity to get their high level of thinking.‚Äù There‚Äôs also the set of people who don‚Äôt want to work like that - where they treat each other with kindness and respect.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs to my coworkers and those who created the work environment where people who are kind thrive.</p>

  <title>My Advice for New Career People</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/my-advice-for-new-career-people.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I‚Äôve worked for five companies in 9 years. The keys for me for job and life satisfaction are now pretty basic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is my manager supportive and someone I like spending time with?</li>
<li>Is the work continuously interesting? Will I develop skills that are likely to bring interesting opportunities in the future?</li>
<li>Is there incentive alignment between what I offer and what the company needs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog post will attempt to describe my thoughts on what makes for a fulfilling career. It‚Äôs a hard question. Maybe something in here is valuable as you search for your ‚Äúideal‚Äù career.</p>
<section id="likely-useless-career-advice" class="level1">
<h1>Likely useless career advice</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‚Ä¶.I‚Äôve been writing this for two hours and I‚Äôm not sure any of it makes sense. Skip to the ‚Äúbooks to read‚Äù section if you get lost. At this point I‚Äôm too lazy to edit any of the below but don‚Äôt want to delete it. Sunk costs baby‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some say a job should help you 1) earn or 2) learn and if neither then leave. But that framework doesn‚Äôt work because you can learn anything anywhere. If you‚Äôre not learning things you enjoy learning about, that‚Äôs moot.</p>
<p>Also, knowledge is accretive. As I look back on jobs I didn‚Äôt love, I still learned things. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the type of consulting I was doing 10 years ago, but I‚Äôve now started a consulting firm and having had that experience is helpful. So it‚Äôs all kind of gray. I didn‚Äôt like pulling weeds as a kid but I‚Äôm now pulling weeds as a homeowner so yea, I‚Äôm glad I know how to do that.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-life-anyway" class="level1">
<h1>what is life anyway?</h1>
<p>Per <a href="../book-review/guide-to-decision-making.html">Guide to Decision Making</a>, ‚Äúresulting‚Äù may apply if you say you made a good decision because you enjoyed a job. By the same token you made a bad decision because you didn‚Äôt enjoy the job.</p>
<p>The reality is that ‚Äúall or nothing thinking‚Äù is more of a cognitive bias, per <a href="../book-review/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.html">The Coddling of the American Mind</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-worry-cure.html">The Worry Cure</a>. And so, you‚Äôre going to learn things as long as you‚Äôre remotely interested in learning things. Whether they satisfy your <a href="../book-review/the-6-types-of-working-genius.html">Working Genius</a> is another matter.</p>
<p>Can you land your dream job? Or is it a myth? 30-40% of first time marriages end in divorce. And not all of the remaining 70-60% are blissfully happy either. But many of those 70% ARE blissfully happy. Or they will be. Or they were and they will be again maybe or something‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Marriage and work are similar: they‚Äôre a type of relationship.</p>
</section>
<section id="professional-and-life-happiness" class="level1">
<h1>Professional and Life happiness</h1>
<p>Happiness to me comes in two forms: doing the best I can with the circumstances I have (the cards I‚Äôve been dealt) and choosing environments that are healthy (the game that gives me the cards).</p>
<p>This is life. Some games are fun to me. Others less fun by definition. But any game may be better than no game. Unless the game involves a high risk of me breaking my spine. Nuance.</p>
<p>Point is: it takes a long while to find what environments you thrive in. Any company can offer just one or potentially many environments depending on their size or the role.</p>
<p>So if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre interested in, you must explore. You try.</p>
</section>
<section id="experiment-your-way-to-a-happy-career" class="level1">
<h1>Experiment Your Way to a Happy Career</h1>
<p>You can ‚Äútry‚Äù by doing it yourself. Do you want to be a teacher? Go try to volunteer teaching. Do you want to be a coder? Spend 20 hours trying to build an app. Do you want to be a doctor? Volunteer with doctors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading about an industry or job is kind of helpful.</li>
<li>Talking to people in the field is more helpful.</li>
<li>Engaging with people is the better form.</li>
<li>But actually doing the work is the only way to know.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can lower the risk of not liking a job by trying to do it without actually having to get the job.</p>
<p>You can get a pretty good sense by doing little projects similar to what the real work is going to be. Don‚Äôt be dictated because you don‚Äôt yet have the role.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-not-try-something-because-of-a-dumb-reason" class="level1">
<h1>Don‚Äôt Not Try Something Because of a Dumb Reason</h1>
<p>And that‚Äôs kind of the great myth: the myth of titles and credentials. That you need to be experienced at something to be able to do that thing.</p>
<p>I once spent a single week shadowing dentists in an open room in Honduras. I was a Spanish translator for these American dentists that came through. I felt pretty confident by the end that I could probably do one of the fillings just because it really wasn‚Äôt that complicated. And the dentists told me so. Once you look at 100 cavities in a mouth it‚Äôs not hard to spot them. This was the easiest way to de-myth this job: watching and observing.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It was actually really boring. Once you‚Äôve seen 100 cavities you‚Äôve seen them all I think. Glad I figured that out quickly! But I know there‚Äôs someone out there that disagrees with me and I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôll be drilling my teeth and not me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>90% of most people jobs could be taught via apprenticeship, like the good old days. Today‚Äôs world of credentials makes people think they‚Äôre incapable of doing a pretty simple task: putting a drill into someone‚Äôs tooth. But before you invest 8 years of your life in dental school, why not go be a dental hygienist for 1 year? Instead of doing a coding bootcamp, why not just code in your basement for a month after hours? This is the way to find what you like.</p>
<p>Whether you enjoy doing that thing that created value for people can only be discovered by doing it.</p>
</section>
<section id="people-hire-you-because-you-offer-a-service-or-value.-period." class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>People Hire you Because you offer a service or value. Period.</h1>
<p>Your real job is to create value for people. It‚Äôs not a title. It‚Äôs not a credential. It‚Äôs not mandated or necessary in society. And if you were born 100 years before today or 100 years after the job may not exist. So think about opportunities in this way.</p>
<p>A healthier way to thinking about corporate life is: what creates value? Is there a reasonable exchange of goods for my offering?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm capable of many offerings. But they‚Äôre hiring for one offering. That‚Äôs life.</p>
<p>If I were selling apricots, and someone was offering me peanuts, would I exchange my apricots for their peanuts? Well, if we were the only two people sure.</p>
<p>But maybe I feel like I can get some avocados for my apricots. So can I find an avocado dealer? Do they even like apricots? Do they already have enough apricots? And if yes to all the above, are they even in the mood to exchange for apricots today? Lastly, do they like me?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-exchange-of-goods.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Work is just an exchange of goods</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Getting a job is more of a negotiation than anything. And everything in work is a negotiation. Read <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> and that becomes quite apparent. It‚Äôs nothing fancy. It‚Äôs not a title. It‚Äôs not a degree. It‚Äôs just doing little activities.</p>
<p>And after you‚Äôve 1000 similar activities you‚Äôre soon labeled a data scientist or a farmer. And if you circled the right boxes on an exam and got a piece of paper you‚Äôre now a doctor/dentist. But the paper or the title don‚Äôt make you good at that thing. My point: create value, not titles.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-sum" class="level1">
<h1>In Sum</h1>
<p>So yes. I‚Äôve gone on a rant here. But hey this is my blog. I‚Äôm trying to talk about the deeper issues at how to choose a profession or a company within that profession. I‚Äôm trying to break away from the titles and credentials that blind our thinking away from the more important questions of ‚Äúwhat activities bring me joy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow will I know if?‚Äù And ‚Äúwill someone pay me for doing this activity?‚Äù And ‚Äúhow do I find an environment of people that will enable me to do valuable activities and make it a pleasant place to work?‚Äù (PS, don‚Äôt work for <a href="../book-review/elon-musk.html">Elon Musk</a>‚Ä¶unless you enjoy is working style.)</p>
<p>Long story short: make sure the company hiring you actually needs your skills to run their business. Strive to find better opportunities by putting yourself out there and trying new things. And find people you like working with. All the rest is just a bonus.</p>
<p>The most dangerous thing is to get all those good things on your first job because then you try to self actualize per Maslov‚Äôs hierarchy of needs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt it always seem to go That you don‚Äôt know what you got ‚Äôtil it‚Äôs gone?‚Äù (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big+yellow+taxi+lyrics&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-ca&amp;client=safari&amp;si=AKbGX_rdaVK-rhf5KHnOAD2drrRmADv7R3TkES869sRtvhJtAOFIxRuJ9oGiG6TvSdbxEwjlbUdo-jivJcsfmZzA84yEzB3d-vLGFPTy5juD3yV4riCQxI1XJ6ZQGPnEjGqh-qYE7AaZxecxMD6ZV9wfd6ykO8ZaKA%3D%3D&amp;ictx=1&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi176q45LuFAxVsKkQIHdMLBT4QjukCegQIIxAE">Lyrics</a>) So if you get a ‚Äúbad‚Äù job just know it‚Äôs part of the process and one day 10 years from now you‚Äôll probably be grateful you had that job anyway.</p>
<p>If I didn‚Äôt actually answer your questions that‚Äôs because some questions are a perennial debate. Some popular people hate the idea of work-life balance, some embrace it. Go figure. And keep searching to find someone who sees work and career the same way you do, because there are millions of jobs in the work. Hundreds of millions. # Books to read</p>
<p>It helps to get perspective when choosing where you want to work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a> - have a decision framework</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/the-6-types-of-working-genius.html">The 6 Types of Working Genius</a> - understand who you are.</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/overcoming-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team.html">Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team</a> - it helps to recognize a good company by first understanding a bad company.</li>
<li><a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a> - a job is a job at the end of the day. It‚Äôs just fishing.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="practical-questions" class="level1">
<h1>Practical Questions</h1>
<p>Things I‚Äôd think about in your shoes:</p>
<ul>
<li>what loosely sounds interesting? Who perhaps knows someone with that type of role? How do I get 15 min with that person, or a quick email? (Use 6 degrees of separation to your advantage)</li>
<li>do I have an ideal salary? What‚Äôs realistic? (Levels.fyi, don‚Äôt over or undersell yourself. Figure out market rates and if your job will support your desired lifestyle in a location)</li>
<li>what‚Äôs the entry level job that gets me some experience 50% in the right direction that I‚Äôm interested in?</li>
<li>where will I learn?</li>
<li>Does this company offer flexibility to try new things?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes job searching is helped by thinking by contrast:</p>
<ul>
<li>what can someone not pay me $500k per year to do? $300k? $100k? (Nobody could pay me $500k to be an investment banker and work 100 hour weeks. Maybe they could pay me $2M and I‚Äôd do it for 2 years ya know? But $500 isn‚Äôt enough.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you‚Äôre interviewing:</p>
<ul>
<li>what incentivizes people on a daily basis?</li>
<li>will this job be around in 2 years? Why? Why not? Why might they fire me in 6 months for things 100% outside of my control? (Recessions, business strategy shifts, etc)</li>
<li>how essential is my skillset to what they do?</li>
<li>what relationship do people have with my would-be manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to potentially ask your hiring manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you see me fitting into this role?</li>
<li>Why might this role not be a good fit for me?</li>
<li>Who‚Äôs the highest ranking person who‚Äôs quit or been fired recently and why?</li>
<li>How do you define success for this role?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to ask your peers you‚Äôre interviewing with:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe your relationship with your manager?</li>
<li>describe the communication patterns of the team?</li>
<li>describe how decisions are made? What‚Äôs a recent decision that was made? describe your role in how the team made that decision?</li>
</ul>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>

<p>It‚Äôs that moment where you stop walking because you walked to the destination you can no longer approximate.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs called a peak.</p>
<p>Human nature loves peaks. They‚Äôre exclusive. Interestingly, they‚Äôre probably far more tracked than random grassy spots in your neighborhood park. Because everyone wants to get to the peak.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm grateful I can hike. That I can choose random destinations. And that I can go to them.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Warm naps on the couch</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/warm-naps-on-the-couch.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today the family was watching General Conference on TV. I joined them and hopped under a cozy blanket. Suddenly, I felt off. Like I didn‚Äôt belong in the room. Like I didn‚Äôt belong awake.</p>
<p>And so I departed slowly into another realm. This is happiness.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Customer Service Agents</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/customer-service-agents.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I reached out to a customer support agent.</p>
<p>It took 90 minutes before the chat finally connected me to them. But they responded! And I think they solved my problem. TBD.</p>
<p>But it was great being able to reach out to someone I don‚Äôt even know who just answered my question!</p>

  <title>Jacob 1 - Viewing Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/jacob-1-viewing-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to <strong>provoke him</strong> to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and <strong>view his death,</strong> and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi. <a href="../scriptures/jacob-1.8">Jacob 1.8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ was clearly angry when he flipped the market at the temple. And it‚Äôs said he‚Äôs a ‚Äújealous‚Äù God and has his wrath and such.</p>
<p>God won‚Äôt be mocked. But he‚Äôs the first to love and forgive us. So when we bring upon us his wrath, I see this as we‚Äôre bringing upon ourselves the consequences of our own actions. The wrath was determined when He made the law. But it‚Äôs better said ‚Äúwe bring upon ourselves the wrath of breaking his commandments‚Äù than ‚Äúprovoke him to anger‚Äù, for Charity sufferers long and is Kind and is not easily provoked. For He is Charity.</p>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>It‚Äôs much healthier for me to see the commandments as immutable as gravity. Drop something, it‚Äôll brake. Face the wrath of the hardwood floor. But God is quite in control. Quite loving. Quite fair and just.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Mentors</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/mentors.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I‚Äôve had a lifelong mentor, Daron Shepard, for nearly two decades now. We first met when I was a sophomore in high school and he just joined the high school coaching staff.</p>
<p>Our relationship since that time has been many one on one phone calls. Sometimes he‚Äôs called me when he didn‚Äôt know how much I needed it.</p>
<p>And today he‚Äôs been calling me as a professional coach. Each time I talk with him I come away with better ideas on how to see things more clearly.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs like the giving tree. I keep coming back to him at different phases and he keeps helping me in new ways.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Wet Suits</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/wet-suit.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I‚Äôve been going to the beach for four years and have never gotten deep into the water. It‚Äôs frigid. I‚Äôll skimboard along the surface or the little crash but never felt a need to go into the water. Besides, it‚Äôs freezing.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs not to say I wouldn‚Äôt want to if it‚Äôs warm - I love to body surf and boogie.</p>
<p>Recently I went back to the beach but with a wet suit in hand. Suddenly everything was better. The <a href="../gratitude/skimboarding.html">Skimboarding</a> was better because I wasn‚Äôt afraid of falling and getting a rash, or I wasn‚Äôt afraid of being cold. I could take the waves head on. And then I just went right out into the water and had the best boogie of my life on a solid wave.</p>
<p>It was incredible. I mourned that I‚Äôve wasted 4 years.</p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/building-a-story-brand.html">Building a Story Brand</a>, I was impressed by the author‚Äôs philosophy on giving away things. His time. Resources. Knowledge. He challenged the notion that in business you should charge for everything. Instead he sought to give away as much as he could. His business has grown pretty well.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also the principle of reciprocity, well studied in <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a>. When we give, people feel a social debt and want to repay it even more than what was given.</p>
<p>Both of these things are taught by the Savior‚Äôs desire for us to give freely, ‚ÄúIt is more blessed to give than to receive.‚Äù (<a href="../scriptures/acts-20.35">Acts 20.35</a>)</p>
<p>Consider the design: instill in people a desire to repay debts. When one person gives, other people give more back. Then the first person wants to give because a surplus was given to them. And then and then and then. More giving.</p>
<p>I reviewed this in <a href="../gratitude/marriage.html">I‚Äôm Grateful for Marriage</a>, the parable of the no-elbow people. Better to give.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>How do I add an iCloud account to iOS Outlook without it being a public calendar?</p>
<p>It was easy to add any gmail accounts but I didn‚Äôt know how to add my iCloud calendar to iOS Outlook. Part of the issue is my iCloud account is actually my gmail email address so I can‚Äôt sign in with this or it‚Äôll load my gmail calendar.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to iOS settings &gt; iCloud &gt; get your <code>@icloud.com</code> name. If you use your gmail account for iCloud there‚Äôs still this <code>@icloud</code> account.</li>
<li>Attempt to log into iOS Outlook calendar. Apple will then make you create an app-specific password for iOS Outlook</li>
<li>Use this password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Done. Pain solved.</p>

  <title>Why you should log with Aimstack</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/why-you-should-log-with-aimstack.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I‚Äôve long idolized <a href="https://aimstack.io/">Home | AimStack</a>. It‚Äôs a tool that allows you to track metrics and hyperparameters and a whole bunch of stuff. It lets you compare across experiments.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-aimstack.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Aim landing lage</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I first built my own version of this in <code>RShiny</code> back in 2017 so I could compare AUC across experiments.</p>
<p>I was using <code>h2o.ai</code> at the time which had this great flow for monitoring an individual experiment but made it impossible to compare across experiments.</p>
<p>Then my company Capital One built <code>rubicon</code>: <a href="https://github.com/capitalone/rubicon-ml">GitHub - capitalone/rubicon-ml: Capture all information throughout your model‚Äôs development in a reproducible way and tie results directly to the model code!</a>. This was cool and they open sourced it. It tracks parameters.</p>
<p>But it pales in comparison to <code>aim</code>.</p>
<p>Aim can do all these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track hyperparameters</li>
<li>Track learning curves (like a metric over time such as when building DL models and you‚Äôre watching how the error decreases with each epoch)</li>
<li>Track any <code>plotly</code> plot, which means you can put any EDA charts nicely organized in one place</li>
<li>it captures all your <code>logging.info</code> calls so you don‚Äôt need to use a remote logging thing like <code>cloud watch</code> to monitor long runs</li>
<li>It has its own loggers if you want to differentiate</li>
<li>It lets you take notes on an experiment</li>
<li>If lets you compare across experiments</li>
<li>It lets you use locally or remotely as a remote API</li>
<li>It tracks images, etc.</li>
<li>it connects with ML packages like <code>xgbost</code> to auto log.</li>
<li>It can even convert <code>MLFlow</code> data.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs incredible. Use it. It‚Äôs free.</p>

  <title>Configurations for ML Pipelines</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/configurations-for-ml-pipelines.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Configuring an ML pipeline means you have 15 different things that could change at any time and you create a way to easily change those 15 things. Those 15 things could be file paths, data filtering steps, models you want to use, etc.</p>
<p>Any researcher constantly asks themselves: but what if I switch X?</p>
<p>And so the researcher starts to configure a pipeline.</p>
<section id="config-methods-ive-used" class="level1">
<h1>Config Methods I‚Äôve Used</h1>
<p>First time I built a config it was in VBA. I had a text file I loaded in that could be overwritten based on setting someone chose.</p>
<p>Second time I config‚Äôd something was in Python. I used <code>ConfigParser</code> per my Manager David Mantilla‚Äôs suggestion. It was pretty good for 2017. But unwieldy. Don‚Äôt use this. It had cool string substitutions but there are better tools now.</p>
<p>Third thing I saw was using a Python constants.py file. Just import Python variables from another module. This is nice because you can import model objects or such. Dicts. Whatever. Seems great. But it‚Äôs Python code. Config files shouldn‚Äôt be code. They should be configs. Every great software follows this, like <code>k8s</code> helm charts or whatever. Google loves using <code>Protobufs</code>. Configs shouldn‚Äôt be code, because if they‚Äôre code they‚Äôre dangerous. You start doing crazy things with them.</p>
<p>Fourth thing I did was to use YAML which is very clean. Lots of people like YAML. This gets unwieldy if you need 100 configs for different customers, for example. Can you imagine managing 100 yaml files? What if you need to update one param? Then you need to update 100 files. Rough. So then you start setting ‚Äúdefault‚Äù blocks and settings.</p>
<p>I also used Pydantic to read in the YAML file and validate types. Gotta validate types. What‚Äôs an int vs a string? Well, this mean that we needed to design the pipeline to rely on some <code>config</code> class. We had to pass this config object around everywhere. Not super idea but gets the job done.</p>
<p>Fifth thing was to use one default YAML. This solved the issue of redundancy across all the 100 YAML files. (If you only have one model, you probably need only 1 YAML file so this may not be your problem.) But this still kinda stinks. It‚Äôs in a file.</p>
<p>Sixth thing was some eng‚Äôs on my team saw a better way and build a CRUD database. This made it so we didn‚Äôt have to do a code change to update a config. That means that people outside the team could edit a config. Awesome. But we still have 100 web pages that could change. Kinda sux. And we still had a default setting - essential. Benefits of a crud are migrations. You can get rid of one option across 100 configs more easily.</p>
<p>Problem with 100 YAML or 100 web pages is that if you want to change things or run experiments, you need to literally clone the config file. Now you have 15 versions of the same config file with slight modifications and you can‚Äôt remember what‚Äôs going on. So you delete them all eventually and just pick one.</p>
<p>Seventh thing: shove everything into environment variables. Create a <code>.env</code> file and load with <code>dotenv()</code> but that gets messy because env files don‚Äôt support data type validation. Validation is essential, lest you try to encode a Boolean in your env file only to realize environment variables only support strings and then you have a ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù rendering as true in your ‚Äúif os.get(MY_BOOL)‚Äù call just because it exists as a valid string. Blech‚Ä¶ ü§Æ</p>

<section id="hydra" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Hydra?</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm writing this because I just learned about <code>hydra</code> . Remember: I use this site for note taking. Here‚Äôs what I just learned.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Hydra!</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra | Hydra</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Hydra is Python open source maintained by Facebook</li>
<li>If built to configure pipelines, in particular ML pipelines but could be used for anything.</li>
<li>It uses <code>dataclasses</code> and <code>yaml</code> files, so I‚Äôm thinking I was smart for what I did with my fourth option.</li>
<li>But it quickly allows you to override config files from the command line or from editing the yaml file directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This demo is slick:</p>

</section>
<section id="why-i-like-hydras-design" class="level1">
<h1>Why I like Hydra‚Äôs design</h1>
<ul>
<li>This seems really nice because it avoids the headache of changing code.</li>
<li>Also, you can create a simple bash loop to execute 5 different experiments - while retaining only one config file</li>
<li>Also, I used to think that having a system of record is pretty important: I need to save the configs that were used for this run. That tells me how the pipeline or experiment was configured. I still think that‚Äôs true: but I believe that should be done via logging instead of managing 15 config files.</li>
<li>My new belief is that experiments should be ephemeral to keep the code clean. Have one prod <code>yaml</code> file and then everything else is ephemeral. Log everything: log the created yaml file with all defaults filled inso you can recreate it if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="my-ideal-world" class="level1">
<h1>My Ideal World</h1>
<p>Hydra doesn‚Äôt solve the ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have to do a git push to update prod‚Äù. If everything is a <code>yaml</code> file then to update prod you need to do a code change.</p>
<p>Google doesn‚Äôt seem to mind using code changes because everything is a protobuff. Code changes are nice because they‚Äôre reviewed.</p>
<p>But code changes are slow. And non-coders can do them.</p>
<p>So I believe one prod config should live in a UI with a database backend. But then that should be serialized to <code>yaml</code> and loaded via something like hydra.</p>
<p>I also believe experiments should be launched programmatically. Meaning I should be able to kick off 10 experiments training 10 models using a bash script. I can then log this experiment using <a href="../tech/why-you-should-log-with-aimstack.html">Why you should log with Aimstack</a> and I can log the full config there.</p>
<p>Also, I‚Äôd throw <code>hydra</code> in with <code>metaflow</code> .</p>
<p>How do you configure? # Appendix</p>

<li>This and <a href="../book-review/1984.html">1984</a> are two books everyone should read. This book was written 93 years ago and it‚Äôs eerily prescient of what‚Äôs happening in society. The pursuits of happiness and the role of the state and technology to those ends are evergreen topics. The pains that John felt entering a society but choosing true happiness over contrived ones.</li>
<li>Parallels today: people escaping to social media and TikTok like soma</li>
<li>People wanting government to solve all their problems ‚Üí the 20,000 alphas who wanted the government to step in</li>
<li>People feeling adrift without an internal purpose and happy to just accept what comes their way or what society conditions them to believe ‚Üí independent thinkers banished to islands</li>
<li>Over optimization of Silicon Valley trying to optimize everything in their life</li>
<li>Linda and John‚Äôs fates as they enter a world they don‚Äôt belong to. Adrift.</li>

</div>
<p>I‚Äôm grateful for Easter. I‚Äôm grateful for the knowledge of a Savior. That He died, and rose from the dead. That He lives.</p>
<p>A belief in Jesus is a belief in quite a number of wonderful things:</p>
<ul>
<li>All people will live eternally. We will all get bodies because of Him.</li>
<li>Death is not the end, but just another step in an everlasting life</li>
<li>Sickness and pain is only temporary. In the hereafter there are joys untold awaiting us.</li>
<li>A God is willing to die for us. We are worth His love. His sacrifice. Each one of us.</li>
<li>There is unimaginable power in this universe that we can‚Äôt imagine even tapping. Who on earth can raise the dead? Not even the most brilliant doctor. But for Christ, it‚Äôs what He will do.</li>
<li>Families and beloved relationships will perpetuate beyond the grave.</li>
<li>There is always hope even in the darkest days. Christ was among an oppressed people. He was rejected by those he came to serve. He was crucified. But then he rose from the dead and it was finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are even many more blessings.</p>

<p>It’s hard to fathom how pretty these hills are. I see them every morning as I drive from my house. I see them in the distance. But their full beauty isn’t appreciated until my feet climb.</p>
<p>There’s something about being in the valley that causes me to think I know what’s up there. I’ve also been up there many times.</p>
<p>But the reality is it’s just its own thing. I gotta go see it to believe it. And it’s really worth believing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t see their role in your problems.</li>
<li>don’t tell you about stuff.</li>
<li>Self referential vs self reflective</li>
<li>Expressing feelings wasn’t condoned or supported.</li>
<li>Crying stops when given emotional support. “I’ll give you something to cry about”</li>
<li>Focuses on facts and dive deep in intellectual topics but not emotions</li>
<li>Overemphasize physical health → we can feel as children a bond to those who took physical care of us but not emotional.</li>
</ul>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Bodyfulness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bodyfulness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Mindfulness is a state of mind. But being present with one’s body is another matter.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/heal-your-nervous-system.html">Heal Your Nervous System</a> has been interesting as I’ve learned about additional senses beyond the five we commonly know. Certainly, meditating has had experiences for me that have been floaty feelings or what not.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’ve had these experiences and know what they are.</p>

  <title>Easter Study: Seek Miracles</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/easter-seek-miracles.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the same way, the Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, “doubting nothing.” Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith. I promise that you can experience for yourself that Jesus Christ “giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.” Few things will accelerate your spiritual momentum more than realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life. <a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-the-power-of-spiritual-momentum">“The Power of Spiritual Momentum”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Reading this gives me pause. I have always thought not to seek for signs. “A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh signs” or what not. But this is different. This is seeking miracles, which is the Lord’s hand in our life.</p>
<p>If I seek a miracle, I seek Jesus’ hand in my life. His healing. His advice. His teachings. Those are and were His miracles.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Fairy Houses</title>

<p>This is a fairy house:</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">This is a fairy house</figcaption>

</div>
<p>It took us hours to build, and I’m not sure where the idea came from, but we each took time building something for the house. There’s an A frame, a Bon fire, a ladder, a circle swing. And most importantly: a door to the fire pit.</p>
<p>My wife commented, “I kinda wanna go out and play out there.”</p>
<p>It’s magical. It was a special time to work on this memory with our kids. I’m grateful for these moments that parenting provides. I don’t know when else it’d be so exciting to hit glue some sticks together. But it was.</p>

<p>Book: attachment disturbances in adults.</p>
<p>Five core needs of attachment(like a house) 1. foundation. Safety and protection. 2. Walls. Attunement. Attune to the feelings. Identify the feelings, provide safety for them.

<p>Secure attachment Dismissive attachment - Solves problems by avoidance or workaholic Preoccupied attachment - abandonemwnt, extra reassurance - Expressed delight was missing - Seek approval or reassurance. - Highly sensitive to rejection - Overshare personal details - Anxiety Disorganized or fearful attachment.</p>
<p>Imagine having your attachment needs met. IPF therapy. IPF protocol. Don’t just think about. Imagine. Feel everything of having met. - Deep breaths - Identify what you need: feeling supported. - Reflect - Imagine ideal parenting. - Create image of what ideal parent figures would look like. - Imagine those ideal parents interacting with your.

<p>Interoceptive awareness. Body scan. Exteroceptive awareness: your surroundings.</p>
<p>Elevator alertness map: put coping strategies into the map.</p>

</ul></li>
<li>Diagnosis. How you feel. Disease. Three pillars of wellness.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-27</p>
<ul>
<li>sensitivity: like an orchid or a tulip.</li>
<li>Belief: those who are more sensitive can rewire faster.</li>
<li>Neuroplasticity: past patterns can be rewired completely without long term entrenchment</li>
<li>Four areas</li>
<li>Embedded alarms: why you don’t make the same mistake twice, or become afraid of dogs.</li>
<li>Misrepresenting the word “trauma” can cause you to feel higher emotional reactions to more benign experiences. → how you perceive the word and its definition affects you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Five stages - awareness - Sensory stimulatjon - active proprioception - jump rope - passive Proprioceptive - Massage gun - Deep tissue - Tactile input - Manipulate textured - Olfactory input - Oral (tasting) - Visual - Sleep - Light 10 min after waking. - Light for 10 min in late afternoon. - Dim lights after sunlight, keep low to the ground - Regulation - restoration - Connection - Expansion</p>

  <title>On file formats: parquet vs csv</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/on-file-formats-parquet-vs-csv.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Came across this article today: <a href="https://kaveland.no/friends-dont-let-friends-export-to-csv.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Robin’s blog – Friends don’t let friends export to CSV</a></p>
<p>This has largely been my experience too: go with the file format that’s fast reading in and out.</p>
<p>It’s rare a data scientist with open a file on their computer rather than just <code>pd.read_*()</code> it in.</p>
<p>In my last job, we were using <code>jsonl</code> files for no other reason than it how one person liked to use command line tools to analyze it.</p>
<p>But if you’re using command line tools to inspect a data file, and not just a Python repl, you’ve already gone down the wrong direction IMO. But what if you’re on a remote server and don’t have pandas installed? Yea, that’s not something you should plan for. At that point, just scp the file to a place you can read it.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Ever Shifting Tides</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ever-shifting-tides.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The tech industry is pretty crazy. I was just watching some keynote talks from Nvidia and if they actually land half of the stuff they’re talking about, they’re going to just plow the world in a new direction.</p>
<p>I watch it and probably feel both awe and fear. What will the future look like? And will I do anything that cool? I kind of look at my little bag of talents and wonder how I fit into this big world.</p>
<p>But I do. I do fit in. I’m a part of that tide of shifting technology, of pushing the boundaries forward. I’m grateful for a job in tech. It isn’t easy. But it’s rewarding. It’s changing people’s lives.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Better Health</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/better-health.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Having the flu stinks. I realized quickly this week how a life revolves around health. My ability to do my job, to be there for my family, and even enjoy sitting on the couch is all impacted by what’s going on inside my body.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is: when I’m sick, I only want to get better and I realize what’s most important. But as I get better, my mind focuses in equal proportion on the normal preoccupations of life and I perhaps focus less on the things I had just realized were most important.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for good health.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for CS Lewis</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/cs-lewis.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Probably and odd thing to be thankful for, but I’m grateful for this guy’s legacy. Having read <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> I decided to read <a href="../book-review/mere-christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve read a few things by Lewis and have enjoyed his writing. It’s also fun to better imagine him writing it when he was at Oxford in 1940’s.</p>
<p>His writing continues to influence millions. I’m grateful he chose to write what he did even though people around him didn’t want him to.</p>

<p>When we don’t have time to build an audience, we’ll partner with a creator. Give them a cut of the business.</p>
<p>Then we’ll create a little community of the power customers. Sometimes it’s just an iMessage group or WhatsApp group.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the feeling of Skimboarding</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-feeling-of-skimboarding.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I only had 10 minutes to skimboard today. But I saw this little flat spot off to the side, where the waves were receding slowly. It looked perfect.</p>
<p>First one or two were a bit slow. But then I started to pick it up again. Pretty soon I was running compulsively to the next wave, just like when I was 22 when I really learned.</p>

</div>
<p>Then I had a great run. Hit the crash of the wave as best as I’ve ever done it. Didn’t wipe out. Just a great, energizing feeling.</p>

<p>I want these young men to come away with an appreciation for the restoration of the gospel and how the Book of Mormon plays a role in their lives.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.3">2 Nephi 27.3</a></p>

<section id="lesson" class="level1">
<h1>Lesson</h1>
<p>Know: What the apostasy is. What a prophet is. Feel: that they’re alive at a special time. Do: ask Heavenly Father if this church is the true church. And keep asking.</p>
<p>Activity: - apostasy. - Every boy is a prophet. - They need to invite people to repent. Repent and come unto Jesus. - Everyone else throws things at them. - Ask: who would you rather be - the one listening or preaching? - Have a pause for one minute of silence for how long the time was that they didn’t have a prophet.</p>

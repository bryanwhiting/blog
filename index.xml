  <title>10 steps to optimize anything</title>

<p>I love-hate goal setting. Here are 10 steps I often fail at in how I try to breakdown and achieve goals, but hey, this is LinkedIn so I‚Äôll share‚Ä¶</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Objective: Define your ‚Äúwhere you are going‚Äù and your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.</li>
<li>Principles: Decide what‚Äôs worth it in how you pursue your where/why.</li>
<li>Key Result: Measure the goal numerically 1-3 ways. Too many is too confusing.</li>
<li>KR-Drivers: Identify the key drivers that affect the goal.</li>
<li>Hypothesize: Use data/intuition to guess what will drive increases in KR-drivers.</li>
<li>Experiment: Try 2 approaches, manipulate the drivers in big or minor ways.</li>
<li>Track: Measure/track/Log what‚Äôs needed to measure if your hypothesis was valid or rejected.</li>
<li>Analyze: make minor tweaks in the drivers and measure statistically significant changes.</li>
<li>Conclude: Which direction will increase your KR. Consider alternate paths if the experiment didn‚Äôt yield good results.</li>
<li>Periodic Evaluation: At a pre-determined cadence (1 wk, 6 wk, quarter), choose if your KR is helping you achieve your objective.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>A few lessons learned as a professional experimenter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking is not the key result. Don‚Äôt confuse them. Too many people&nbsp;&nbsp;track habits for no reason (I‚Äôm guilty of this 100%)</li>
<li>KR‚Äôs have no purpose if you don‚Äôt have an objective. You want 100k ffollowers? 100k revenue? They don‚Äôt mean anything until you know what you‚Äôre going to do with it. More fame/money doesn‚Äôt equal more life satisfaction. Lots of unhappy/depressed rich/famous people.</li>
<li>‚ÄúExperimentation‚Äù early into defining a product should be massive swings. Find the ‚Äúlowest hanging fruit‚Äù, make the biggest changes.</li>
<li>Have principles to guide your KR‚Äôs. If you don‚Äôt</li>
<li>Have Anti-KR‚Äôs - things you won‚Äôt do. This is the hardest. If you have 10 KR‚Äôs, perhaps KR‚Äôs 2-10 should be all anti-KR‚Äôs. Otherwise, you‚Äôll get distracted on 2 despite you knowing 1 is most important.</li>
<li>A rising tide lifts all ships: By improving one KR, you may be sacrificing improving another. But more likely you‚Äôll actually improve all KR‚Äôs, because they‚Äôre usually correlated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy Example: ‚ÄúI want to be healthier‚Äù</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Objective: I want more energy to be able to devote it to my kids.</p></li>
<li><p>Principles:&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>I will not hurt my body by doing unnecessary XYZ</p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm not going to kill myself. I‚Äôm going to keep this simple.</p></li>
<li><p>KR:&nbsp;&nbsp;(Write down 10, pick the one that will obviate the rest)</p></li>
<li><p>Gain 10 lbs of muscle</p></li>
<li><p>Eat 100g of protein a day</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep 8 hours a day</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate 20 minutes a day</p></li>
<li><p>KR-drivers for gaining 10 lbs of muscle:</p></li>
<li><p>Lift weights</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on quads</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on upper body</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesize: If I go to the gym for 10 minutes for 28 days and do 30 exercises a day, I‚Äôll gain muscle.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment: I‚Äôll keep my diet the same - including the popcorn. I‚Äôll focus my mental energy on clearing my calendar and getting out the door to the gym. The ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù experiment is what I‚Äôve done the last 28 days‚Ä¶not worked out ü§£</p></li>
<li><p>Track:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Day 1: I‚Äôll weight myself, write a journal about how I feel. Perhaps ask myself some questions.</li>
<li>Did I go to the gym for 10 minutes? I‚Äôll keep a piece of paper and a pen taped to my mirror or on my nightstand. Checkbox. Don‚Äôt track anything else. This is my one focus right now.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Analyze: on day 28, I‚Äôll weigh myself again.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Conclude: Did this 28-day challenge change how I felt? Be honest: it might not. Perhaps I can get on my bike, or hike, or do pushups every day instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodic evaluation: every 2 months I‚Äôll investigate how my energy is.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>your goal isn‚Äôt to gain/lose weight. Your goal is to feel better about your health. Your key result is a number on a scale going up/down.</p>

  <title>Reading this Daily</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>#SundayThoughts Six weeks ago I stopped listening to podcasts in the morning and started listening to The Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Perhaps this book doesn‚Äôt do it for you. If so, there are other scriptures or ancient philosophy texts that teach good principles. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is a good one.</p>
<p>Listening to this timeless, ancient book every day has helped center me. It‚Äôs reminded me of God‚Äôs timetable. Of God‚Äôs intervention in the course of human nature. And of God‚Äôs unending love for us as His children.</p>
<p>How do I listen? I picked a theme: Revelation. I took notes every day on what the 10-30 minutes taught me about that theme. Now I‚Äôm working on the theme of ‚Äúpatience‚Äù.</p>
<p>Having this more-constant anchor in my life helps me remember what‚Äôs important each day. I feel a little bit more confidence and centered perspective each day I start with this practice.</p>

<p>Solid read: https://markmanson.net/attention-diet Over the last year I had read a few things similar to the points here and went on an ‚Äúlow information‚Äù diet (Tim Ferriss quote?).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I don‚Äôt miss the global news. It only got me angry.</p></li>
<li><p>The point of learning something is to take action and create positive change in the world. If I learn about things I don‚Äôt plan to take action on,</p></li>
<li><p>if that sounds uneducated, another reason to learn something is to gain empathy and change my perspective. However, the global news is generally biased by the wars for subscriptions between a handful of editors.</p></li>
<li><p>Niche news is far more educative. I‚Äôve subscribed to blogs, to specific influencers in my field, etc. I‚Äôve learned things from these people that I can apply that day in my job. I‚Äôm subscribing to things that feed my career.</p></li>
<li><p>long form content is far better way to understand current events. If you want to understand the state of the world, read a book on it. Most major geopolitical events are insanely complicated and cannot be surmised in 126 characters. Read a few books on the things you care about.</p></li>
<li><p>there‚Äôs so much thought put into even a low quality book. Think about it: most books get reviewed by editors in the very least. They probably get read once or twice at least by the original authors. So what would be a better time for your energy - a low quality book or a set of posts on LinkedIn likely generated by ChatGPT or Jasper.ai? If a low quality book &gt; than a tweet, surely 30 min a day of a high quality book (easy to find) is worth more than most low quality content.</p></li>
<li><p>I broke my iPhone in 2020 and waited 45 days for a replacement. But it wasn‚Äôt fully broken - the screen was hopelessly shattered on the bottom half where typing is required. So I kept it in my drawer and only used it when I needed to. The risk of using it? Getting a shard of glass stuck in my finger. I wish I still had that to some degree because it forced me to be focused. I realized very few people texted me anything urgent that couldn‚Äôt wait a few days. I could still call people with Siri, but nobody called. We‚Äôre optimized to be addicted. That‚Äôs literally the goal of these phones and the apps on them. That‚Äôs not a bad thing. It‚Äôs just not in our best interest.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried using a junk $40 replacement phone I found in my closet while waiting those 45 days to get my iPhone replacement. The phone was from 2015 when I got married - it was a teaser phone from the cell company. It probably downloaded at 2 mbp/s. Any time I clicked a link I had to wait 15-20 seconds for the page to load.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I was amazed. I was shocked this piece of junk actually could take notes. Could email. Could browse the internet. But I also learned not to click on things unless it was worth 30 seconds of my time.</p>
<p>How do I spend my time now? Not wisely enough. A lot of things should be done on a computer. Most things should be planned. Few things are urgent. Fewer are essential.</p>

<ul>
<li>storytelling: I really like how <a href="../book-review/shift.html">Shift</a> does the psychological aspect of perishing. Last moments, last thoughts. I think Tolkien could have enhanced some of the fighting scenes by documenting the last moments.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs interesting how in the movie the destruction is the big climax, but in the book Isengard is already destroyed before they get there. I like the suspense of not knowing what‚Äôs going to happen.</li>
<li>But the nature of LOtR is that it‚Äôs a story told by people. A story within stories. The council of Elrond was very well written. Stories within stories. Each person telling their own story.</li>
<li>I like how Tolkien has so much back context. That‚Äôs what makes it so interesting. It‚Äôs not just Frodo‚Äôs story. But Frodo is context amidst a great history of many people.</li>
<li>It makes sense why LOTR is really just one book. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs written. One massive epic.</li>

  <title>A Treatise on Agency and Goals</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

<p>I may have ADHD to some degree, I‚Äôm not sure. These thoughts came to me today when considering my side business.</p>
<hr>
<section id="a-treatise-on-desire-uncertainty-commitment-and-execution-toward-a-goal." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-treatise-on-desire-uncertainty-commitment-and-execution-toward-a-goal.">A treatise on desire, uncertainty, commitment, and execution toward a goal.</h2>
<p>Descartes proposed that if you pick a direction and walk in a straight line you‚Äôll eventually leave the forest. This assumes you want to leave the forest.</p>
<p>A desire is a persistent yearning. Desires take root and, when nurtured, become reality.</p>
<p>An achieved desire is a blend of hope, faith, and charity. A hope (goal) is the edge of the forest. Walking is faith (belief + action). Charity is long suffering and persistence - the ability to maintain hope and faith.</p>
<p>A hope is envisioned or observed. If observed, there is believed certainty in achievement, with uncertainty in the path. An envisioned hope has uncertainty in both the path and the outcome. You might die trying. Envisioned hopes are impossible only when the path is not made clear. Thought makes the path clear.</p>
<p>A clear path is a plan. A plan is a sequence of informed choices and actions leading towards a goal, a consequence. A causal effect. Reconnaissance is the finite time and energy spent collecting information. Reason invites spending time and energy proportional to the cost or impact of the plan and goal. Judgment determines which choices and actions are taken.</p>
<p>Commitment is recognizing many roads lead to Rome, and only one of them can be walked to actually get there.</p>
<p>Luck is unknown things. Some things could have been known with more reconnaissance. Other things could never have been known or anticipated. Luck either enables or disables the path. Luck happens post plan, post deliberation. It‚Äôs the unknown distance between you and the forest‚Äôs edge. Hindsight bias is the present mind‚Äôs ability to mistakenly believe uncertainty was always certain. ‚ÄúI should have known‚Äù is an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Enabling luck makes possible the goal. Disabling luck makes difficult the goal, perhaps impossible. Impossible is usually a state of mind or the laws of physics, but usually never both.</p>
<p>Tilt is the mist of blindness caused by the presence of luck. Tilt distracts from information and commitment, a bias caused by observed outcomes that were previously uncertain.</p>
<p>Commitment is time and energy. Time is measured by rotations of the earth or attempts made. Energy is measured by willingness to roll the dice again.</p>
<p>Commitment is also reconnaissance. More actions, more information. Ignorance is choosing not to see the information. Stubbornness is seeing it, and maintaining the status quo for thrill of ego. Humility is hunger for more information.</p>
<p>Uncertainty invites fear and worry. Perceived time spent amplifies fear and worry. Uncertainty in the path. Uncertainty in the destination, etc.</p>
<p>A plan is the process of committing to something knowing that hindsight bias creeps in with each step. The plan mitigates the drag of hindsight bias.</p>
<p>Fear and anxiety are compounded when accomplishment doesn‚Äôt happen within perceived time. Human nature is to lose all track of time when in a task, so time should be planned for. Time to evaluate the plan and assess new information should also be decided in the plan.</p>
<p>Commitment to the plan is a recognition of the infallibility of human emotion. Judgment is evaluating if the plan could be improved, and the plan includes time/effort-base checkpoints for evaluation. Commitment is the recognition that, while the direction you‚Äôre heading may not be the right one, (shortest path between you and the edge of the forest which you can‚Äôt know at onset), walkikg straight is better than circling from changing direction multiple times. Straight lines are incapable of not exiting. Circles may exit but are capable of not exiting.</p>
<p>If new information overrides understood information at the time of the plan, and changes the decision that would have been made given the circumstances at the time of the plan, then wisdom and humility is the ability to change direction despite how many miles walked (sunk cost).</p>
<p>Walking in a straight line in business is ‚Äúwalking in accordance to the plan‚Äù. The time spent deliberating the plan should be proportional to the costs and benefits of the action, which requires judgment. Inspiration is praying that God will guide you and enable your plan.</p>
<p>Arrogance is believing you have infinite energy and time. Optimism is appreciating that any mile walked strengthens your legs, that the direction you chose may not match the imagined ideal. Self awareness is appreciating that the human mind is capable of any imagination, and few imaginations consider accurately all costs or benefits of reality. Imaginations are powerful, but can cause circling, and are most powerful during the plan. After the plan, use imagination to accomplish it. Before the plan, use imagination to design it. But don‚Äôt use imagination during the plan to redesign it, I.e, avoid circling.</p>
<p>Action gets stuff done.</p>

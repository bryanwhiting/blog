  <title>Unreal AI: Meet Sora</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Years ago Deepmind proved they can solve StarCraft: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cUTMhmVh1qs?si=BXO9WJ-2WV1jgf0f">YouTube</a></p>

Now OpenAI is probably using reinforcement learning using physics engines. Meet Sora: <a href="https://openai.com/sora">Sora</a>.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
If you think OpenAI Sora is a creative toy like DALLE, … think again. Sora is a data-driven physics engine. It is a simulation of many worlds, real or fantastical. The simulator learns intricate rendering, "intuitive" physics, long-horizon reasoning, and semantic grounding, all… <a href="https://t.co/pRuiXhUqYR">pic.twitter.com/pRuiXhUqYR</a>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - Love and Despair</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-love-and-despair.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>2 Nephi 4 has two interesting scriptures:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine a human who has felt so much love to describe it as the consuming of his flesh, yet have perhaps a degree of self loathing because of his sins? That he’d like to be happy but he can’t because he knows what he’s done wrong?</p>
<p>I think anyone who is a human can empathize.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-peace-vs-despair.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Same person, same feelings"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Humanity is about building a relationship with God. God is about letting us have agency. He doesn’t expect us to be perfect. He expects us to be human, but guides us to perfection. In some sense He demands it, knowing we’ll fall short.</p>
<p>But we can take comfort in that He will bless us even when we feel undeserving.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Book Club</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/book-club.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Belonging to a book club means you’re old. You’re so old that book clubs are how you have fun. Not playing pickup basketball. Not going to concerts. Not going to the movies. Not going longboarding down the canyon. A book club.</p>
<p>What’s better than any old book club? One with friends that you’ve already done all that other stuff with. One that helps you stay connected. One that inspires new ideas.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the boring book club. Because it’s fun.</p>
<p>It’s also fascinating how everyone picks up different insights. <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> talks about how hostage negotiators always have one speaker and three or four other people on the call trained to listen to just one thing. It’s because the mind can only process so much information. It’s cool to see how friends pick up on all that different stuff.</p>

  <title>Observable Framework 1.0 vs Quarto</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/observable-framework-vs-quarto.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/">Observable Framework</a> seems like a nice competitor to Quarto. It seems like it has far fewer features, but some other more specialized features.</p>
<p>Things they can both do:</p>
<ul>
<li>use markdown to build websites and apps</li>
<li>Use Observable for plots and reactivity</li>
<li>Load data from any format, using any language</li>
</ul>
<p>Things Quarto excels at:</p>
<ul>
<li>more full featured - can be a blog, a site, etc.</li>
<li>can execute raw R or Python code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things Observable seems better at (based on glancing the docs only):</p>
<ul>
<li>More beautiful</li>
<li>More powerful reactivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like observable is good for people who prefer JavaScript for plotting.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - A Prophecy of Another Branch</title>

<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.2">2 Nephi 4.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another powerful reminder of things lost from the Bible, similar to <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-20-baptism-in-the-old-testament.html">1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament</a>. As we look at 2 Nephi 3:5, we see a link to the Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die, and go unto my fathers; and I go down to my grave with joy. The God of my father Jacob be with you, to deliver you out of affliction in the days of your bondage; for the Lord hath visited me, and I have obtained a promise of the Lord, <strong>that out of the fruit of my loins, the Lord God will raise up a righteous branch out of my loins</strong>; and unto thee, whom my father Jacob hath named Israel, a prophet; (not the Messiah who is called Shilo;) and this prophet shall deliver my people out of Egypt in the days of thy bondage. <a href="../scriptures/jst,-genesis-50.24">JST, Genesis 50.24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine if for 2000 years the entire world knew about this prophecy and the other things in 50:24-38 # Meaning</p>

<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-wager.html">The Wager</a> right now and am enthralled and saddened by the horrible circumstances people had to go through on boats back in the day.</p>
<p>Without explorers, we wouldn’t have the knowledge of the world that we have now.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the freedoms we enjoy now, as most of us don’t have to fear about body snatchers coming to take us on a ship and force us to work until we die.</p>

<p>The Scottish man you’re referring to is Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean, now known as Robinson Crusoe Island, part of the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile. Selkirk lived alone on the island from 1704 to 1709. His story is believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe’s novel “Robinson Crusoe.” Selkirk was a skilled navigator and sailor, and his survival skills, including hunting, gathering, and shelter building, allowed him to survive until he was eventually rescued by an English ship. His experience highlights the human capacity for adaptation and survival in extreme conditions.</p>

<p>The book <a href="../book-review/mindset.html">Mindset</a> talks about “fixed” vs “growth” mindsets. My post <a href="../posts/decisions-are-rivers.html">Decisions are Like Hopping on a River Raft</a> - decisions take you down to known endpoints.</p>
<p>Bring those two concepts together and on one hand there’s a trajectory - where you’re capable of going given your decisions (and mindset) and your mindset - how you perceive your circumstances.</p>
<p>Someone recently told me, “It’s not what you go through but how you perceive what you’re going through that matters.”</p>
<p>I believe perception is powerful. Any negative situation can be reframed for a positive. This is mindset.</p>
<p>But the other component is also important: where your circumstances will take you if pursued every day for the next 30 years.</p>

<p>If you’re an extremely happy person but you don’t take action to get out of a minimum wage job, such as spend time on self improvement, you’re going to stay in your minimum wage job (nothing wrong with that, just trying to illustrate a point).</p>
<p>And so, to get what you want out of life you can’t just assume things will get better without any change on your part. You can 1) change your mindset or 2) change your trajectory.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered whether at times in my career I was complacent or not, or whether I was growing doing what I was doing. That’s not a helpful question. Because if you’re too myopic you can miss that you doing your multiplication tables isn’t going to change anyone’s life, but if you can’t do multiplication you can’t be a machine learning engineer.</p>
<p>Most days in our work are steps. Steps towards something.</p>
<p>A spaceman can’t land on the moon unless they build a rocket. They won’t make a rocket unless they choose to land on the moon. And by choosing the moon they’re choosing to <em>not</em> open a Chinese restaurant.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Some roles have upper bounds. Staying at that upper bound isn’t a bad thing. It’s just a thing. Other roles open up different opportunities the longer you stick around, opportunities you won’t get else where perhaps.</p>
<p>So if you’re feeling stuck, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will I be if I stay with this for the next two years?</li>
<li>Is that directionally where I want now to head?</li>
<li>Is there something about my mindset I can change today to help me reframe so that I don’t miss the opportunities already around me?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTH.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Foam Mattresses</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/foam-mattresses.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Bed in a box. It’s all the rage.</p>
<p>It shows up on your porch. You lug it upstairs, cut it open, unravel it and poof: you have a bed.</p>
<p>The first time we got a foam mattress was in 2017. It changed our life.</p>
<p>Anytime I travel I always wish I was home. Nothing like a long nights sleep in a reasonably priced, highly comfortable, never sagging, bed in a box mattress.</p>

  <title>Coalesce - Revelation first, then Agency</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/coalesce-revelation-first-then-agency.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Some believe in pre-destiny. That their life is predetermined.</p>
<p>Some believe there is no God and they have to do the best they can with what they’ve got, because that’s all they’ve got.</p>
<p>The truth lies somewhere in between. There <em>is</em> a God, <em>and</em> He wants us to be agents (<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.28.html">Doctrine and Covenants 58.28</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-plan-a-and-b.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Life is filled with choices and many actions to perform"> In data science, there’s a concept called “coalesce”. In English it means to come together and make one whole. In software, it means to fill in missing data with a default value.</p>
<p>Forgive the nerd talk, but bear with me here: So if you have an empty spreadsheet, and you do the operation <code>coalesce(spreadsheet, 5)</code> it would return the spreadsheet’s value if you had data in the spreadsheet but the number 5 if you had a missing cell. So if you have 10 rows of data in Excel but 3 missing rows, the output would be the 7 original values with 3 cells now with 5 in them. It’s a way of handling missing data, because missing data creates problems.</p>
<p>What is the missing data in our personal lives? It’s “what do we do?” What do we do today? Tomorrow? Next year? What do we do today and tomorrow to prepare for the thing we may want to do next year?</p>
<p>I’ve realized the healthy way to have a relationship with personal revelation is to operate under the constraints of a coalesce. To be whole and one with the Lord, our goal should be to coalesce.</p>
<p>Some rely too much on the spirit. Hoping God will make a choice for us. But he gave us agency. He lost 1/3 of his children because he didn’t want to give up agency. And, by that right, he’s willing to lose you and me too if we’re not willing to exercise our agency. We just choose. This is life. And we must choose Him.</p>
<p>In many things, there is a commandment we can rely on. Don’t kill. Don’t steal. Be honest. Pay tithing.</p>
<p>That’s the priority.</p>
<p>Then there’s the gray area stuff: love our neighbor.</p>
<p>That’s the agency.</p>
<p>Then there’s the really gray area: have joy. Among this is “provide for a family” and “raise them the best way you can”.</p>
<p>So, use a coalesce. Your default value is what <em>you</em> want to do. That’s what you fill in.</p>
<p>Our life should be <code>coalesce(personal revelation, our agency)</code>.</p>
<p>Where there’s a commandment or personal revelation from the Lord, do it. Don’t wait. Do it. Follow the prompting. Otherwise, if you have no prompting or commandment to follow, make a choice! Learn. Experience. Enjoy.</p>
<p>I believe the Lord will support us when we follow a pattern of putting Him first, and then defaulting to doing many good things of our own free will and choice when He hasn’t given us instruction.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean he doesn’t care what we do. He cares deeply. It’s just more like <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23.html">Ether 2.23</a> where he wants us to come up with some good ideas.</p>

Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.35">2 Nephi 4.35</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the limitations we can put on the Lord? Here are a few that get me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord wants me to struggle on this one</li>
<li>I don’t want to ask too much</li>
<li>This isn’t that big of a deal. I should pray about more important things instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these are easily contradicted by scriptures. He <em>does</em> want us to struggle but struggle <em>with</em> him and overcome (<a href="../scriptures/1-corinthians-10.13">1 Corinthians 10.13</a>). The Lord wants us to ask for all the blessings He’s capable of giving us (<a href="../scriptures/malachi-3.10">Malachi 3.10</a>), and pour out endless blessings.<sup>1</sup> And lastly, the Lord works by small and simple means (<a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps instead those three things should be exactly what we pray for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can we struggle on together? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30.html">Matthew 11.28–30</a>)</li>
<li>What’s the gift that thou art willing to bless me with? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-6.8.html">Matthew 6.8</a> )</li>
<li>What’s the smallest piece of help I could possibly ask for? (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23">Ether 2.23</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase “ask not amiss” isn’t some indication that a secret code needs to be enacted. That to unlock the heavens, the prayer needs to be offered in the right way at the right time by the right person.</p>
<p>How can you ask amiss? The scriptures teach us. If we’re selfish, seek our own, are puffed up, are easily provoked, want revenge, are greedy, etc. then we’re asking amiss.</p>
<p>But if we’re trying to do our best to be good people and dealing with the challenging responsibilities of being a father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, neighbor, coworker, manager, etc. then we’re just dealing with life.</p>
<p>What is life without these titles? Who doesn’t work? Who doesn’t have someone to care for?</p>
<p>It’s precisely <em>these</em> things that are worthy of our prayers and divine supplication.</p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a> is a theme I’ve tried this year. I’ve grown deeply in finding healing by making sure I can have a private place to pray.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen how prayers have been answered in ways I didn’t expect. That something comes unexpectedly and it turns out to be really good. But it wasn’t in the plans.</p>
<p>This is kind of like a personal manna. God delivers. Not expected. But welcomed.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Chicken Sliders</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/chicken-sliders.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I sit down for lunch with a friend. The seat is leather. The booth is warm. The table is glossy with that restaurant-style gloss. And the paper in front of me invites me into a world of tasteful possibilities. The most appealing one is that of the chicken biscuit slider.</p>
<p>Moments later a plate of sliders appears next to a side of truffle fries. The aioli sauce invites a potato’s partnership. The crispy crunch of the fried chicken echos within the cavern of my bite. Eyes close. Satisfaction is earned.</p>

  <title>War Tech</title>

<p>Obviously war profits defense contractors. This isn’t anything new.</p>
<p>And putting aside beliefs about the war itself, I see the angle here as somewhat inauthentic. It assumes tech is somehow awful.</p>
<p>Arms dealers will always be in the race for selling more arms, whether in peace or in war. But providing services at a discounted rate to defend an invaded ally seems reasonable.</p>
<p>My point: I wish we had more positive tech news. Tech is how we won WWII and almost how we lost it. That same awful WWII tech is how we now power homes with cleaner energy across the world. Some argue it’s how we’ve avoided a WWIII so far because it’s a nuclear war is an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>Tech cannot control the hearts of the men and women who wield it. It can only enable them. May we all strive for wars of words and code not wars of people or weapons, and I actually think tech helps enable that. And hopefully, we can use tech to facilitate misunderstandings and bring people to better diplomacy, ending the need for war. But that’s up to the leaders. Desires for war rage within hearts long before those desires rage within bullets.</p>
<p>As for the main stream media, I’d hope for more nuanced discussions around the uses of tech. Perhaps that’s what it’s alluding to - that war mongers are being fueled by this war.</p>
<p>But then let’s get more diplomatic leaders into office that can manage peace talks. It’s a people problem. Our government shouldn’t be run by the war machine, but by the people. And tech will always enable the people to do what they do best: be human.</p>

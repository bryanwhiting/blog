  <title>I’m Grateful for Skimboarding</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/skimboarding.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Skimboarding is one of those oddly satisfying sports that isn’t exactly thrilling but just delightful enough that you can’t get enough. It’s like popcorn. Always delicious, but you want just one more.</p>
<p>The perfect setting is a beach with a long shore, so the tide comes in and slowly ripples out. This is when you can really glide.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Consecration</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-consecration.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Lehi, now in America after a long journey, sits his son, Jacob, down for a chat. He told him all his hard times would be rewarded:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall <strong>consecrate</strong> thine afflictions for thy gain. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.2">2 Nephi 2.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will <strong>consecrate</strong> thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9.html">2-nephi-32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To consecrate is to “make or declare something sacred” (Oxford), or “to devote or dedicate exclusively to a purpose”.</p>
<p>From this lens, Jacob’s trials (like all his brothers and sisters) could be declared sacred (for the purposes of the Lord) and dedicated to the Lord’s purposes and cause.</p>
<p>Likewise, through prayer we can consecrate all of our acts. We can make them sacred devotions. What would your life be like if every day you dedicated it to the Lord? Where you did everything with a sacred purpose and cause?</p>
<p>And what if He made all those things consecrated for your spiritual gain?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-consecration-gift-to-cloud.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Consecration feels fuzzy, but it’s just giving yourself to something greater. It’s a mindset"> # Meaning</p>
<p>I can find more ways to consecrate my day and actions. To give myself with greater purpose.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Long Runs</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/long-runs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2020 my friend invited me to train for a marathon. Against better judgment, I accepted. I started training in Jan of 2021, prepping for a June marathon.</p>
<p>I said yes because I needed an excuse to work out and I like listening to audio content. Also, I began running a lot in college, which was good times. The best part is getting to the top of a mountain, running a mountain trail, or discovering a new route. It all seems so natural and human. Just you and the land.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-long-runs-wilderness.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">I actually did enjoy some beautiful scenery not too dissimilar to this while training.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There’s something enlivening about a long run. There’s an endorphin kick that boosts your mental state. Then while running, you keep finding ways to make the same route a little bit longer. Or make it exactly 5 miles.</p>
<p>I often would push my kids in the stroller. I’m not sure how they survived, but they did. There was a great long lath that was a perfect 5 mile there and back, with hardly any interruption.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why this memory came back to me, because I’m pretty sure I never want to train for a marathon again. It’s horrible. It takes so much time. And then I got injured so I couldn’t even compete. But deep down there’s still a longing for a long run.</p>

  <title>Protobufs - Everything I don’t know</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/protobufs-everything-i-dont-know.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>If you want a guide on Protobufs this isn’t it. These are my notes. Just stumbled on this tonight after having seen these all over the place at Google and I wanted to learn something.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffers Documentation</a> and ChatGPT. <a href="../tech/pkl-for-configuration-management.html">Pkl for Configuration Management</a> made me think of this. # The point of a Protobuf</p>
<ul>
<li>write one file</li>
<li>This file defines data structure, but not the data itself</li>
<li>Compile it to different languages (like Python)</li>
<li>A file in Python will be have a class defined with the properties in it</li>
<li>When you serialize data (send via JSON or something over an API) the other service knows how to read that data file immediately (if you built it and gave it the proto)
<ul>
<li>This makes sense to me why Google used this everywhere. They have one service in Python and another in Java and another in Go. To get them talking to each other they need a common data structure to read from.</li>
<li>The setters and getters help with the parsing a JSON blob for example.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Like first you define the protobuf</p>

  <title>Pkl for Configuration Management</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/pkl-for-configuration-management.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://pkl-lang.org/blog/introducing-pkl.html">Pkl</a> is the new kid on the block.</p>
<p>Have you ever built a config for a modeling pipeline? Surely, if you’ve built a pipeline to do experiments you’ve wondered how you can quickly iterate through a bunch of different settings to see which model is the best for your use case.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to generate a list of hypothesis to test, and then compare and contrast them.</p>
<p>Like any good data scientist you’ve created a system to loop over some settings.</p>
<p>It’s the big challenge of data science: how do I configure something? Should I build this function to do one thing or should I build a development environment where I can explore a thousand things? If I build a development environment how do I know if all the things I’ve configured aren’t going to be moot in a few weeks or months?</p>
<p>I don’t have the answer to those questions. But perhaps how we design our configs can affect those design decisions.</p>
<p>Pkl is cool because it lets you do a for loop to output configs.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic config file per their docs:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-pkl-configs.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Config</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And here’s that config looped and rendered:</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Rendered</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="application-to-ds" class="level1">
<h1>Application to DS</h1>
<p>I’m not 100% sure that this is any easier for a Python developer than just using ChatGPT to loop some parameters and spit out a bunch of yaml files. Because YAML does have some validation to it. And YAML has been around a long time.</p>
<p>Anything’s better than Python’s ConfigParser…yuck.</p>
<p>Reminds me of <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffers Documentation</a> but honestly I don’t know much about this stuff. See <a href="../tech/protobufs-everything-i-dont-know.html">Protobufs - Everything I don’t know</a></p>
<p>But it’s nice to see people are thinking about configs…</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Shake off the Chains</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-shake-off-the-chains.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Keeping the commandments brings blessings:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.20">2 Nephi 1.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it. Keeping the commandments means being honest, being kind, being respectful, finding a way to help others. Not being lazy. Being productive.</p>
<p>Literally, nobody can prosper without keeping some commandment. Without finding a way to meet someone’s need.</p>
<p>I also like this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.23">2 Nephi 1.23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a rallying cry we can all relate to. We are all bound with chains in life. But we don’t have to be. The call to “rise up” is a call to shake the chains to hold you bound. Arise from the dust!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-breaking-free-from-the-chains.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Break free from the chains"> # Meaning</p>
<p>It makes me wonder: what are the chains that hold me bound? Perhaps there are limiting beliefs.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New York</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-york.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Since I was a kid, going to the city was a quarterly event. Whether going to the Bronx Zoo or the Met for a class field trip or a Yankees game, the city was always an adventure. As I grew up, it’d be the place to go to shows and concerts and visit family members who lived there.</p>
<p>Then when I was 22, I spent a summer as an intern there. Living in the city taught me what it means to be in the city.</p>
<p>From a guy who’d come up to help me with something on the Subway, to the lady who gave me some of her loose change to take the cross town bus, I was humbled by how people there look after each other. It’s hard to notice when the people are tough on the surface. But deep down they care for each other.</p>
<p>I’ve been to LA, and lived near SF, and DC and nothing compares to “city”.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/">Galileo AI</a>. It lets you mock up UI interfaces. Great story in their blog: <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/blog/seed">Galileo AI - Feb 6 Launch Announcement</a></p>
<p>It doesn’t export the code itself, but for a fee it’ll export to Figma for you. The cool thing is they trained or fine tuned an LLM specifically on design components. This is a cool use case of how people with specialized skill sets will create custom LLMs to compete in areas ChatGPT won’t be able to.</p>
<p>This is also showing the emergence in new software: don’t build a rules engine, train an LLM to solve the problem.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Obtaining a Promised Land</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-land-of-promise.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures-a-land-of-promise" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures: A Land of Promise</h1>
<p>I thought about the phrase “land of promise” in <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-2-receiving-a-promised-land.html">1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land</a> and there’s the verse in <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5.html">1 Nephi 5.5</a> where Lehi says “I have obtained a land of promise”. He says that years before arriving in the promised land.</p>
<p>But now, years later, he testifies:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>notwithstanding our afflictions, <strong>we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands</strong>; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.5">2 Nephi 1.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long did it take for them to receive that land? Many years. And many hardships. Lehi complained and was chastised at some point (1 Nephi 16). So the journey isn’t without its struggles.</p>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>The Lord is with us. Even if we complain and struggle, He wants to help us get to a better place, our promised lands.</p>
<p>We can be like Lehi and seek to obtain that personal vision. And receive a personal covenant of how the Lord wants to bless us in our lives.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Kindness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/kindness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been the recipient of a lot of kindness in my life. I know anyone reading this has too. Kindness is a wonderful gift to give someone. It doesn’t cost anything to be kind.</p>
<p>Ways people have been kind to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone called me when they knew I was making a big decision to listen to me.</li>
<li>Parents who showed me how to be kind to each other.</li>
<li>A friend who complemented me.</li>
<li>My wife who goes on dates with me and hangs out with me.</li>
<li>A child who wants to give dad a hug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindness does need to be <em>received</em>, I’ve learned. Kindness can be received when things are going well, as well as when life is tricky, though kindness is probably most poignantly felt and appreciated during hard times. I think that’s a gift: to receive kindness. It’s also a gift to give. Who do you know that could use some kindness today?</p>

  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/how-to-share-an-html-file-like-a-quarto-output-in-github.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Let’s assume you have a raw HTML file on GitHub, such as a <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-html/">Jupyter notebook you rendered to HTML</a> or a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html">Quarto</a> doc you rendered via <code>quarto render</code>.</p>
<p>If you try to share the link from GitHub directly, GitHub will just show the raw HTML file.</p>
<p>Use this link to convert it to your dashboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/">GitHub &amp; BitBucket HTML Preview</a></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>GitHub File: https://github.com/bryanwhiting/blog/blob/gh-pages/index.html</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Alternative Endings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-alternative-endings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Lehi and his family were prompted to leave Jerusalem before King Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed it in 586 BCE.</p>
<p>There must be that lingering doubt, when following the Lord, as in “what would life have been like otherwise?”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have seen a vision, in which I know that Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have perished. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.4">2 Nephi 1.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lehi knew the answer: had they stayed they would have perished.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-paradise-vs-destruction.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">What if the alternative to the choices you made was actually a much worse life?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>We hardly ever get to know how it would otherwise have ended. What if you took job A over B? What if I hadn’t broken my wrist? What if I had moved into X house vs.&nbsp;Y - who would I have met?</p>
<p>I’m not sure we’re supposed to know how it could otherwise have turned out. I’m not sure it matters much, either. Because I’m sure there were a lot of good people who weren’t prompted like Lehi to leave. (Consider how Abinadi had to stay.)</p>
<p>So I take this as “that’s interesting.” In this case, Lehi got to know the alternative ending to the story. He got to learn that he had avoided destruction in Jerusalem and could instead finish his days peacefully in his promised land.</p>
<p>We also often compare our lives to how perhaps it could have been better (thanks social media). Do you ever wonder if it could have been worse had you not made that good choice in your life?</p>

  <title>World’s Longest Drive</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There’s a fun $75,000 purse for the winner of the World’s Longest Drive.</p>
<p>These guys are averaging 400y in contest, which is an attempt to drive straight. This guy wins (ofc) but his first round is the best. 432.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gv3YACYV648?si=jXXsfxfHxpmcpHFZ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Apparently the record is 515 set in 1974 by Mike Austin, a 64 year old.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s kind of crazy that since 1974 the record for longest drive hasn’t been broken.</li>
<li>Tech helps, but old school can sometimes be the way. Form over gear all day.</li>
</ol>
<p>But Berkshire broke that record per his Instagram account. Here’s the full scoop:</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Avocados</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/avocados.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“Aguacate, verduras!” It’s a common refrain you hear on the streets of <a href="../concepts/Honduras.html">Honduras</a>.</p>
<p>I first remember being woken up by this loud bark as a vendor walked the street inviting the entire town to enjoy his “avocados, vegetables!!”</p>
<p>I don’t blame him. I, too, want people to enjoy the things I like. And if this guy was selling avocados then I wanted to be buying.</p>
<p>It’s rare that I don’t want avocados on anything. Tonight, I enjoyed them on a hot dog, a classic dish called a “completo” in Chile. Put it on a burger. Put it on a hot dog. It’s like green eggs and ham, I’d eat it on a train, with a fox in a box. Here, there, anywhere.</p>

  <title>Embedding audio in Quarto</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/embedding-audio-in-quarto.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I want to embed just a plain audio file in my blog post.</p>
<p>Check out the post <a href="../creative/guitar-clouds.html">Guitar: Clouds</a>, where I embed some audio using the quarto video short link: <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html">Quarto – Videos</a>.</p>
<p>My process:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a voice recording with my voice notes on iOS.</li>
<li>Save to files, I did audio/ folder (<a href="../posts/quarto-from-phone/index.html">How to blog from your phone using quarto (or hugo/jekyll/etc) using Working Copy and Obsidian</a>)</li>
<li>Then if I link using a standard markdown link it’ll create an audio recording in a new browser. If I use the video shortcode then quarto will embed it as a video right in the post (doesn’t open a new browser). You can adjust the height so it’s not a massive black screen.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
Song snippet today: [2024-02-05-guitar-clouds](../audio/2024-02-05-guitar-clouds.m4a) 3rd capo, G, Em, C, G with some pinky action. 


&lt;-- This works on safari, not chrome desktop for some reason --&gt; 

![2024-02-05-guitar-clouds](../audio/2024-02-05-guitar-clouds.m4a)


</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>
<p>Note, the second way (<code>the ![]</code>) approach didn’t work on Chrome Desktop, but works on Safari desktop, safari mobile, and chrome mobile:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-quarto-audio-chrome-web.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Chrome doesn’t pick up the audio player</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If I inspect the HTML I can see the audio tag is created in Chrome, it’s just not showing a player or anything.</p>
<p>But the mobile audio player is picked up:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-quarto-audio-safari.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>

</figure>
</div>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chrome-mobile-quarto-audio.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Mobile chrome</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="obsidian" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Obsidian</h1>
<p>I like using this markdown syntax in Obsidian because that’s where I write my notes.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-audio-quarto-not-rendered.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The markdown syntax</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Because it appears like an audio player in app. The <code></code> syntax is a <code>quarto</code> thing and renders nicely. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag is supposed to work but doesn’t in my vault. In my app it looks like this;</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-audio-obsidian-rendered.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Rendered in quarto</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So yes, the markdown link is the most usable, works on most browsers, and works in Obsidian. Just doesn’t work on Chrome Web…(at least not on my version).</p>
<p>Seems also that using the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag breaks my quarto:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-audio-tag-breaks-the-file.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Broken file</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="in-summary" class="level1">
<h1>In Summary</h1>
<p>I’ve found two ways of showing audio in quarto. 1) using the image syntax in markdown and 2) using a video shortcode. The markdown syntax works great locally on my iPhone and on most browsers, but the video shortcode seems to work on all browsers.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 22 - His Covenants will be the key of the Gathering of Israel</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-22-gathered-by-his-covenants.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>There is so much doctrine packed in here. Nephi is talking about the Lord doing a “marvelous work”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it [the marvelous work] shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, <strong>unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham</strong>, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, <strong>in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel</strong>. Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they <strong>shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-22.9-12">1 Nephi 22.9–12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will restore His covenants. It doesn’t explicitly say “baptism, the sacrament, the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the endowment, and the sealing ordinance”, but that’s what Nephi is referring to.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-image-wheat-into-a-silo.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The Lord will gather us into His silo. This is His work, not ours.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Why doesn’t the Book of Mormon mention the sealing ordinance? The Melchizedek priesthood (the name of it)? The endowment? I’m not sure. But it’s fascinating how Joseph Smith translated this book but also received revelations to help finalize the structure of the church. # Meaning</p>
<p>This teaches me that…</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord cares about people who reject him. He will do His work among them. He won’t leave me even if I leave Him. That’s a powerful concept.</li>
<li>The covenants are the most important thing to focus on in the scriptures. Everything else is just context about how to best live them.</li>
<li>I am gathered when I keep my covenants. They are the thing that help me understand and connect with the Lord.</li>
</ul>

<h1>There is Divine Discontent in the Consumer Appetite</h1>
<p>Jeff Bezos alluded to the “divinely discontent” customer in a 2017 shareholder letter (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/">Elements of Amazon’s Day 1 Culture | AWS Executive Insights</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly becomes today’s ‘ordinary’. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/Amazon_Shareholder_Letter.pdf">2017 Amazon_Shareholder_Letter.pdf</a></p>

<p>More googling shows the phrase was also used by Neal A Maxwell in 1976 (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng">Notwithstanding My Weakness</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What can we do to manage these vexing feelings of inadequacy? Here are but a few suggestions: (1) We can distinguish more clearly between <strong>divine discontent</strong> and the devil’s dissonance, between dissatisfaction with self and disdain for self. We need the first and must shun the second, remembering that when conscience calls to us from the next ridge, it is not solely to scold but also to beckon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Just dropping that in case Bezos gets all the credit for the term 😉.)</p>

<section id="llm-discontent" class="level1">
<h1>LLM Discontent</h1>
<p>People grappling with building LLMs are facing this discontent at an alarming rate. The <a href="../tech/llm-chatbot-arena-leaderboard.html">LLM Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a> is a testament to how quickly appetites will change. Many AI tool providers refrain from vendor lock in and try to build LLM agnostic tooling.</p>
<p>How do you compete? Well, most of us aren’t building these foundational models. How do they compete with each other? None of us care. We just want a good one.</p>
<p>But ask yourself, would you rather have Bard from today or nothing from 2022?</p>
<p>These leaderboards are fascinating because in 14 months since ChatGPT emerged we’ve become so reliant on these tools but yet they’re not even old enough to walk or talk by human standards. Yet we now have Bard, ChatGPT, LLaMA, Mistral, Claude, and whatever’s cooking at Amazon/Apple/Microsoft (behind the scenes as a contingency plan I’m sure) and the Chinese/Indian companies that don’t want to rely on the U.S.</p>
<p>It’s the early days of search: Yahoo, AOL, Ask Jeeves, etc. One will emerge as your favorite perhaps, like how we all use Google even though Bing probably isn’t that bad anymore (I wouldn’t know…).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Point is: it’s a race to the bottom, the customer is fickle. They know this, which is why they keep releasing new stuff every 6 months.</p>
<p>Point is: as you build your LLM application, your customer will be divinely discontent with <em>you</em>. This is nothing knew, it’s just the age of software development.</p>
<p>Expectations of what software can do are rising. Those expectations are becoming indiscernible from the magic that software is becoming.</p>

<p>I just came across the <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/">Chatbot Arena</a>, a place where you can put up a prompt and vote on which LLM has the best output. The leaderboard is here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSys Chatbot Arena Leaderboard - a Hugging Face Space by lmsys</a></p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for bowling</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bowling.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The car is put into park in the dark parking lot of the bowling alley. Rain descends, prompting hurried feet. The building door opens and we walk inside. <em>It’s bowling time.</em></p>
<p>Friends congregate, treats are consumed, and heavyweight spheroids enjoy the frictionless motion governed by Newtonian laws. The gutters are greedier than the pins, but regardless of where the ball ends up the hurler offers up a dance to the bowling gods, a laugh of disappointment, or a thrill of surprise. This has been the states of bowling regardless of the bowler’s age, across all known ages of my life.</p>
<p>The conversations, the dancing, the music, the flashing lights, the cheap food, the magic of self-returning balls - it is its own realm of simple enjoyment. Bowling won’t sell out stadiums, it’s rather boring compared to action sports. But that doesn’t stop anyone from enjoying it, and that’s why it’s a gift to humanity.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Home Depot Saturday Morning Crafts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/home-depot-saturday-morning-crafts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Home Depot gives out little assembly kits for kids on the first Saturday of every month. A few screws. A few pieces of wood. A simple design.</p>
<p>The chatter between children increases the closer they get to the supplier: a Home Depot working handing out presents to eager children.</p>
<p>Impatience grows the closer to the bag’s opening they become. They see other kids nearly finished around them. They can’t wait.</p>
<p>And so repeat the experience every first Saturday of every new month.</p>

  <title>Don’t trust a cloud provider</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/dont-trust-a-cloud-provider.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Never trust a cloud provider to do compute for you, like AmazonForecast. (Or LLM tuning?)</p>
<p>Amazon will charge $1440, take 4.1 hours, and have an accuracy 3x worse than using an open source Nixtla, which cost $1.20, took 15 minutes and had an accuracy metric 1/3 the Amazon service offered (lower accuracy is good in this case.)</p>
<p>Where else are cloud providers ripping you off?</p>

  <title>Chicken Nugget A B testing</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/chicken-nugget-a-b-testing.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Why cutting chicken nuggets for my 2y old is an optimization problem, and how social media companies use these principles:</p>
<p>Objective: maximize my 2 year olds caloric intake</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inputs: chicken nugget size.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut two nuggets four ways: 8 pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut two nuggets two ways: 4 pieces.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Will the kid eat 5 small pieces or 3 big ones?</p>
<p>On one hand, he eats 62.5% of nuggets. On the other, 75%. But maybe he only eats two halves - that drops him to 50% consumption.</p>
<hr>
<p>What gets you watching one more YouTube, one more Spotify song, one more TikTok? One more LinkedIn post?</p>
<p>Do people sign off after 5 posts? One post? If we slide a video into the fifth spot after the first four posts, do they engage? If they engage with the video do they come back tomorrow or in a week?</p>
<p>Everything’s an optimization. Even cutting nuggets. Your mind just does this subconsciously.</p>

  <title>Scientific method</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/scientific-method.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I use these seven steps to the scientific method every single day:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What’s the problem?</li>
<li>Hypothesis: What’s the believed answer?</li>
<li>Metrics: how do I measure with data?</li>
<li>Methods: how do I test the belief?</li>
<li>Findings: what are the unemotional facts?</li>
<li>Discussion: what are my opinions about the findings? (These are usually more hypotheses.)</li>
<li>Next steps: self explanatory 🤣</li>
</ol>
<p>It helps me think more clearly when diving into data! Hope it helps.</p>

  <title>This is an A/B test</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Dude. You’re being experimented on. Aren’t you a little bit curious how it works?</p>
<p>Bruh, they’re experimenting on you. Yes you. Now. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p>Im A/B testing out some clickbait, let’s see if it works 👇👇</p>
<p>This post is not AI generated. I wrote it. But I’m testing an idea: what if I write and publish two posts at the exact same time but with different clickbait hooks? Same content (what I’m writing here.)</p>
<p>Hypothesis: I’m guessing LinkedIn will naturally favor one post over the other. Hard to know which.</p>
<p>A/B testing is all about this every day. Newspapers play with their bylines. Search engines play with their titles. Ad copy is all one massive experiment to see what clicks the most.</p>
<p>So drop a like if you like A/B tests. And keep an eye out for my other identical post, launched at 10am on Tuesday PST. Let’s see which gets the more impressions on LinkedIn!</p>
<p>Here are the two intros:</p>

  <title>Data science structure</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/data-science-structure.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Over my career I’ve thought a lot about “where should a data scientist sit in an org?” 👇 5 lessons from what I’ve learned after working in 6 very different companies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>DS under an MBA: maybe okay, probably bound for failure.</li>
<li>DS under the PM: def bound for failure.</li>
<li>DS under the DS: good for the junior in the short term.</li>
<li>DS under Eng: good.</li>
<li>DS under a people manager, but works closely integrated team with a DS-experiences tech lead: best.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interdisciplinary teams do the best work. It maximizes labor efficiency to have engineers, PMs, and DS’s working on the same problem but doing different things.</p>
<p>When you federate DS, they don’t care as much about what they’re working on. The incentives are off.</p>
<p>When a DS works for a PM the PM will make wild assumptions about what they should do. PMs oversimplify problems and DS find that unsatisfying.</p>
<p>DS reporting to DS means you throw stuff over the fence and the Eng do the real work. And the Eng don’t capture all the nuance the DS would like to implement.</p>
<p>DS reporting to business types is unfulfilling because DS love technical stuff.</p>
<p>best scenario? Have a DS work in a pod with experienced tech leads. DS reports (HR purposes) to someone outside of the team who can give them guidance but is incapable of micromanaging them.</p>

  <title>Forget Pythonic. Write code that works</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/forget-pythonic-write-code-that-works.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For the Python nerds: I’ve seen data scientists bashing notebooks for years. I was one of them.</p>
<p>Then I learned yesterday about nbdev and how Jeremy Howard and folks at Nixtla are building production grade software using…notebooks.</p>
<p>I was taken aback by Jeremy’s YouTube “I don’t write code like most Python programmers, but I have a reason for how I write it”.</p>
<p>I was also shocked how easy it was to read Nixtla’s documentation and source code. Shouldn’t that be the goal??</p>
<p>Unit tests at the bottom of the Python files where the functions are defined. Wait…that makes a ton of sense.</p>
<p>Wirh nbdev there’s no major emphasis on pep8. No black formatting. No like wrap at 80 characters.</p>
<p>And I realized: we put so much emphasis on convention and doing what others are doing.</p>
<p>I’m not saying pep8 or black are wrong. I like them. But Python is just a language. Don’t get sucked into “being pythonic”. If the code works, and it creates value, it serves its purpose.</p>
<p>I come from R where there are so many “dialects”. Compare base R vs the tidyverse. Worlds apart in how they build and test their code.</p>
<p>So…make your own dialect. Just don’t waste time trying to keep up with all the formatters and linters out there. Because who cares? It’s your code.</p>
<p>It’s okay to have you or your team have your own style.</p>

  <title>10 steps to optimize anything</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/10-steps-to-optimize-anything.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I love-hate goal setting. Here are 10 steps I often fail at in how I try to breakdown and achieve goals, but hey, this is LinkedIn so I’ll share…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Objective: Define your “where you are going” and your “why”.</li>
<li>Principles: Decide what’s worth it in how you pursue your where/why.</li>
<li>Key Result: Measure the goal numerically 1-3 ways. Too many is too confusing.</li>
<li>KR-Drivers: Identify the key drivers that affect the goal.</li>
<li>Hypothesize: Use data/intuition to guess what will drive increases in KR-drivers.</li>
<li>Experiment: Try 2 approaches, manipulate the drivers in big or minor ways.</li>
<li>Track: Measure/track/Log what’s needed to measure if your hypothesis was valid or rejected.</li>
<li>Analyze: make minor tweaks in the drivers and measure statistically significant changes.</li>
<li>Conclude: Which direction will increase your KR. Consider alternate paths if the experiment didn’t yield good results.</li>
<li>Periodic Evaluation: At a pre-determined cadence (1 wk, 6 wk, quarter), choose if your KR is helping you achieve your objective.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>A few lessons learned as a professional experimenter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking is not the key result. Don’t confuse them. Too many people&nbsp;&nbsp;track habits for no reason (I’m guilty of this 100%)</li>
<li>KR’s have no purpose if you don’t have an objective. You want 100k ffollowers? 100k revenue? They don’t mean anything until you know what you’re going to do with it. More fame/money doesn’t equal more life satisfaction. Lots of unhappy/depressed rich/famous people.</li>
<li>“Experimentation” early into defining a product should be massive swings. Find the “lowest hanging fruit”, make the biggest changes.</li>
<li>Have principles to guide your KR’s. If you don’t</li>
<li>Have Anti-KR’s - things you won’t do. This is the hardest. If you have 10 KR’s, perhaps KR’s 2-10 should be all anti-KR’s. Otherwise, you’ll get distracted on 2 despite you knowing 1 is most important.</li>
<li>A rising tide lifts all ships: By improving one KR, you may be sacrificing improving another. But more likely you’ll actually improve all KR’s, because they’re usually correlated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy Example: “I want to be healthier”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Objective: I want more energy to be able to devote it to my kids.</p></li>
<li><p>Principles:&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>I will not hurt my body by doing unnecessary XYZ</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not going to kill myself. I’m going to keep this simple.</p></li>
<li><p>KR:&nbsp;&nbsp;(Write down 10, pick the one that will obviate the rest)</p></li>
<li><p>Gain 10 lbs of muscle</p></li>
<li><p>Eat 100g of protein a day</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep 8 hours a day</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate 20 minutes a day</p></li>
<li><p>KR-drivers for gaining 10 lbs of muscle:</p></li>
<li><p>Lift weights</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on quads</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on upper body</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesize: If I go to the gym for 10 minutes for 28 days and do 30 exercises a day, I’ll gain muscle.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment: I’ll keep my diet the same - including the popcorn. I’ll focus my mental energy on clearing my calendar and getting out the door to the gym. The “control” experiment is what I’ve done the last 28 days…not worked out 🤣</p></li>
<li><p>Track:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Day 1: I’ll weight myself, write a journal about how I feel. Perhaps ask myself some questions.</li>
<li>Did I go to the gym for 10 minutes? I’ll keep a piece of paper and a pen taped to my mirror or on my nightstand. Checkbox. Don’t track anything else. This is my one focus right now.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Analyze: on day 28, I’ll weigh myself again.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Conclude: Did this 28-day challenge change how I felt? Be honest: it might not. Perhaps I can get on my bike, or hike, or do pushups every day instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodic evaluation: every 2 months I’ll investigate how my energy is.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>your goal isn’t to gain/lose weight. Your goal is to feel better about your health. Your key result is a number on a scale going up/down.</p>

<p>#SundayThoughts Six weeks ago I stopped listening to podcasts in the morning and started listening to The Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Perhaps this book doesn’t do it for you. If so, there are other scriptures or ancient philosophy texts that teach good principles. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is a good one.</p>
<p>Listening to this timeless, ancient book every day has helped center me. It’s reminded me of God’s timetable. Of God’s intervention in the course of human nature. And of God’s unending love for us as His children.</p>
<p>How do I listen? I picked a theme: Revelation. I took notes every day on what the 10-30 minutes taught me about that theme. Now I’m working on the theme of “patience”.</p>
<p>Having this more-constant anchor in my life helps me remember what’s important each day. I feel a little bit more confidence and centered perspective each day I start with this practice.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Solid read: https://markmanson.net/attention-diet Over the last year I had read a few things similar to the points here and went on an “low information” diet (Tim Ferriss quote?).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I don’t miss the global news. It only got me angry.</p></li>
<li><p>The point of learning something is to take action and create positive change in the world. If I learn about things I don’t plan to take action on,</p></li>
<li><p>if that sounds uneducated, another reason to learn something is to gain empathy and change my perspective. However, the global news is generally biased by the wars for subscriptions between a handful of editors.</p></li>
<li><p>Niche news is far more educative. I’ve subscribed to blogs, to specific influencers in my field, etc. I’ve learned things from these people that I can apply that day in my job. I’m subscribing to things that feed my career.</p></li>
<li><p>long form content is far better way to understand current events. If you want to understand the state of the world, read a book on it. Most major geopolitical events are insanely complicated and cannot be surmised in 126 characters. Read a few books on the things you care about.</p></li>
<li><p>there’s so much thought put into even a low quality book. Think about it: most books get reviewed by editors in the very least. They probably get read once or twice at least by the original authors. So what would be a better time for your energy - a low quality book or a set of posts on LinkedIn likely generated by ChatGPT or Jasper.ai? If a low quality book &gt; than a tweet, surely 30 min a day of a high quality book (easy to find) is worth more than most low quality content.</p></li>
<li><p>I broke my iPhone in 2020 and waited 45 days for a replacement. But it wasn’t fully broken - the screen was hopelessly shattered on the bottom half where typing is required. So I kept it in my drawer and only used it when I needed to. The risk of using it? Getting a shard of glass stuck in my finger. I wish I still had that to some degree because it forced me to be focused. I realized very few people texted me anything urgent that couldn’t wait a few days. I could still call people with Siri, but nobody called. We’re optimized to be addicted. That’s literally the goal of these phones and the apps on them. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just not in our best interest.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried using a junk $40 replacement phone I found in my closet while waiting those 45 days to get my iPhone replacement. The phone was from 2015 when I got married - it was a teaser phone from the cell company. It probably downloaded at 2 mbp/s. Any time I clicked a link I had to wait 15-20 seconds for the page to load.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I was amazed. I was shocked this piece of junk actually could take notes. Could email. Could browse the internet. But I also learned not to click on things unless it was worth 30 seconds of my time.</p>
<p>How do I spend my time now? Not wisely enough. A lot of things should be done on a computer. Most things should be planned. Few things are urgent. Fewer are essential.</p>

<p>2024-05-29</p>
<ul>
<li>storytelling: I really like how <a href="../book-review/shift.html">Shift</a> does the psychological aspect of perishing. Last moments, last thoughts. I think Tolkien could have enhanced some of the fighting scenes by documenting the last moments.</li>
<li>It’s interesting how in the movie the destruction is the big climax, but in the book Isengard is already destroyed before they get there. I like the suspense of not knowing what’s going to happen.</li>
<li>But the nature of LOtR is that it’s a story told by people. A story within stories. The council of Elrond was very well written. Stories within stories. Each person telling their own story.</li>
<li>I like how Tolkien has so much back context. That’s what makes it so interesting. It’s not just Frodo’s story. But Frodo is context amidst a great history of many people.</li>
<li>It makes sense why LOTR is really just one book. That’s how it’s written. One massive epic.</li>

- Joseph was only one to receive revelation. → if you interpret this scripture out of context, you might think no other prophet is worthy to lead the church. But that was a point in time revelation. → like the book of revelation: don't add to this. 
- Don't covet thy own property → the Lord gives. He may recall for His purposes. 
- Land of promise to the saints → riches. Seek with all heart. many lands of promise. Missouri? Utah? 
- Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming. → why didn't the Lord send the word immediately? He wanted to prepare people. He's a fisher of men. A farmer of men. A lord of the vineyard. 

> “Where is your faith? Where is your confidence in God?” she demanded. “If you will all of you raise your desires to heaven, that the ice may be broken up and we be set at liberty, as sure as the Lord lives, it will be done.”

- "Attend to it" - Joseph Senior supported Joseph. The Angel wanted Joseph to know this. 
- David's field being ploughed overnight - a few items were left for David - the Lord did just enough. Also, the Lord honored the man's request and didn't disrespect him. The man got what he wanted, David did some more work, and the unnecessary part was finished by whomever. 
- Didn't know that Jerusalem had a wall. [1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament](../christianity/1-nephi-20-baptism-in-the-old-testament.md)
- Joseph's trouble was being heavily persecuted physically. Like the Israelites. Now, physical persecution has mostly stopped and instead it's just verbal assaults at "the church" from press and random voices on social media. The challenge of our day is to remain faithful.

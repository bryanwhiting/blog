The story is one of Brett and her influence on a group of men. Jake, whom she doesn't want to be with because of an injury, Robert Cohn, who wanted to treat her well, then Mike who is a count, bankrupt, and a Lord with access to money, and Bill, who doesn't interact with Brett much. 

Then Brett runs away with Pedro. 

She can't help herself. She ends up back in Jake's arms, asking him for help when she could have asked Mike. She settles on Mike. 

She lives without morals - floating with the sea. Jake is an observer. 



Personal impact:

- the dialogue is captivating. Calming in a sense. Meditative. Simple. 
- On its surface all that happens is chats at bars, a bull fight, and a lot of drinking. 
- They all want something more, and end up fighting each other for it. None 
- All the characters are predictable. Their arcs hardly evolve. They just meander. And perhaps that's the point. It's the lost generation.

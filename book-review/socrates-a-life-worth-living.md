![Socrates, a Life Worth Living](../img/book-socrates.jpeg){.preview-image}

Notes:
- socrates had a voice he felt was from Gods. Daimonion
- Memorization. Lots of it. 
- Humanism - treated sacrifices to the gods as transactional. This meant they relied on themselves rather than gods to teach them. 
- Odd relationships (pedophelia)
- function: intended purpose. Virtue: quality of function.

- the book is a review of battles in incredible detail. Lots of details on maneuvers. But also shows the desperation. Of the situation. 
- things that impacted me:
	- The way they react to bullets and artillery. Sometimes laughing. Then crying. 
	- The war breaks some people. They go crazy. 
	- Some shot their own hands to avoid the war
	- Million dollar 
	- Cover fire.
	- Looting. Lent up energy. 60+ days no showering. Digging own fox holes deep. Friendly fire and shooting or bayoneting own people. Miracle of a stray bullet not killing you.
	- Polish with guns behind their back (from Germany) so they'd fight.

- they want to be with the best rather than the common infantry unit. Their chances of survival are higher.

- Rat brains → if you introduce intermittent reward, rats can push the button 1,000 times. 
	- Slot machines: help win every 5-10. Then progressively slow it down over time until the person is empty. It's manipulation 
- Habit: cue, routine, reward. [The Power of Habit](the-power-of-habit.md). Keep the cue and reward equivalent, change the routine. Practice in your mind 
- Every victory is a mix of work and luck. Seek truth. 
	- Self-serving bias: they messed up, I did great. I would have won every tournament if it weren't for luck 
- we're more likely to reshape our perspective of the situation to have it conform to our own beliefs rather than accept the truth. #LossAversion [Thinking, Fast and Slow](thinking-fast-and-slow.md)
- Wanna bet on it? → forces you to think. If I say "I'm 60% confident citizen Kane won best picture", it forces you to think why 60%. What's 6/10? Perhaps - 6 times out of ten my gut gets such a thing right.

- reactive vs deliberative brain. 
- Losses feels 2x as bad as wins. Losses are not costs. 
- I'm not sure → if there's a 24% chance then that's one of the 24/100 possible outcomes. And it happened. 
- Scale: 0 to 500. → really bad scale. 
- Life is more like poker than chess. Poker: you can do the best thing but there are so many things out of your control. Novices can win. Luck. 
	- → Ecclesiaates.

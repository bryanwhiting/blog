Danny: 

- remove someone's "gut" and they give better predictions
- Ask not what is true, but what it's true of. 
- Simple algorithms > judgment on average. 
- Don't focus on the recruits, but on the interviewers - remove their biases. 
- If mueller lyar lines can deceive us in something so simple, how can we comprehend the complex?
	- [Thinking, Fast and Slow](thinking-fast-and-slow.md) → if you can recognize it you can avoid being deceived. 
	- → data science. "Oh nice result!" → nope it's just an illusion. Learn to recognize. 
	- → experts can recognize. ⇋

Amos:

- it's the little decisions that are the most revealing because the big ones are mostly luck. The systematic decisions. The consistent ones. 
- the nice thing about urgent things is if you wait long enough they're no longer urgent.

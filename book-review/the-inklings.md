I was reading the wrong book. I read [The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle](the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.md) when my friends recommended *this* one instead. 

I already like this one better. It lays things out better i feel. More chronological. But perhaps it's because he has more time to write it.

Knowing CS was in the war and had some relationship with Moore is fascinating.

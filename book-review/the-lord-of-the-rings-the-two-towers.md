- storytelling: I really like how [Shift](shift.md) does the psychological aspect of perishing. Last moments, last thoughts. I think Tolkien could have enhanced some of the fighting scenes by documenting the last moments. 
- It's interesting how in the movie the destruction is the big climax, but in the book Isengard is already destroyed before they get there. I like the suspense of not knowing what's going to happen. 
- But the nature of LOtR is that it's a story told by people. A story within stories. The council of Elrond was very well written. Stories within stories. Each person telling their own story. 
- I like how Tolkien has so much back context. That's what makes it so interesting. It's not just Frodo's story. But Frodo is context amidst a great history of many people. 
- It makes sense why LOTR is really just one book. That's how it's written. One massive epic.

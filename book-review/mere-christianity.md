- Cs Lewis didn't listen to his friends. He wrote anyway. And I'm grateful that he did. It's a shame anyone feels like they shouldn't write because they don't believe they have the authority to. 
- I'm impressed by his rigor. His thoughtfulness. It's thought provoking. The reasoning is well laid out.

- there is a part of God within us. 
- The Lord is working on all people, to bring Christianity even into their own religions. 
- Pride is the worst sin. 
- the way is easy but it's hard to give in to let Him lead. The lazy person fights letting Him lead. 
- Rats hiding from the light.

- the love of something quickly phases and the lasting thing is the true love. Then that type of person is more likely to find more surprise, compared to the person always chasing the fleeting immediately love. 
- Pride: having more than another 
- A someone with hatred in their heart but a desire to wish well on someone will start feeling charity for that person. Practice it, and you'll feel it. So long as your intent is pure. 
- The desire within us is reflective of something more. Desire to eat can only be satisfied by food. Desire for purpose can only be satisfied by Him. 
- We become like him as a line becomes a shape and a shape becomes a polyhedron. 
- The instrument needs to be clean. A man who keeps himself clean and bright will be able to receive God. Same frequency. 
- Christianity provides the true purpose for life. 
- Three dimensions: Godnspeaks to me, god is within me, and Christ is of God praying for me, giving me the words to pray for 
	- [The Prophet](the-prophet.md) â†’ you can only pray the words given to you (god only listens to the words he gives to you )

- Good people know about good and evil, the way a sober person clearly understands a drunk. 
- Giving charitably. Give more than you can, sacrificing some things for it. 
- I love the theology he thinks through, such as repentance and such. But he also delves specifically into doctrines like saying whether sexual perversion is worse or better than being a nice person to someone else. Perhaps this is the content Tolkien wished he had left to clergy people. [The Inklings](the-inklings.md)

- I wrote [My Testimony](../christianity/2024-03-03-my-testimony.md) today without having read this book - cool to see we both had the same logic on "math" and "law of nature". 
- I love his "unseen hand" or "to compare something as moral or immoral you must do it against some standard "
- When speaking you can use inflection. When writing, you shouldn't use italics because there are better ways of emphasizing the point. Ways you might not be able to employ with just writing.

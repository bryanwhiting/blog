- I wrote [My Testimony](../christianity/2024-03-03-my-testimony.md) today without having read this book - cool to see we both had the same logic on "math" and "law of nature". 
- I love his "unseen hand" or "to compare something as moral or immoral you must do it against some standard "
- When speaking you can use inflection. When writing, you shouldn't use italics because there are better ways of emphasizing the point. Ways you might not be able to employ with just writing.

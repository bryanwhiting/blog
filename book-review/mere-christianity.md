- Cs Lewis didn't listen to his friends

- Good people know about good and evil, the way a sober person clearly understands a drunk. 
- Giving charitably. Give more than you can, sacrificing some things for it. 
- I love the theology he thinks through, such as repentance and such. But he also delves specifically into doctrines like saying whether sexual perversion is worse or better than being a nice person to someone else. Perhaps this is the content Tolkien wished he had left to clergy people. [The Inklings](the-inklings.md)

- I wrote [My Testimony](../christianity/2024-03-03-my-testimony.md) today without having read this book - cool to see we both had the same logic on "math" and "law of nature". 
- I love his "unseen hand" or "to compare something as moral or immoral you must do it against some standard "
- When speaking you can use inflection. When writing, you shouldn't use italics because there are better ways of emphasizing the point. Ways you might not be able to employ with just writing.

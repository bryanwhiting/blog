What did I take away from this?

- No all groups are teams
- Teams are 5-12
- Too many means advocacy overrules inquiry in decision making
- Leaders want to rule their tribes, but they need to recognize they're part of the leadership team. 
- Teams have an objective. 
- Sometimes cutting one person out can immediately improve the team, but often most people need to be challenged or coached. Most will rise to the occasion. This is a long-held personal principle: don't fire. Focus on where that person can thrive. Try three places. Then if it's not working out or they're resisting, then fire. 
- Be vulnerable, not too much
- Team bonding isn't socializing. Team cohesion is doing the hardest work possible: grappling with honesty, candidness, and coming out on top.

1. Absence of trust 
2. Fear of conflict
3. Lack of commitment
4. Avoidance of accountability 
5. Inattention to results 

- we often attribute a leader's dysfunctions to a xharacter flaw (internal) but attribute our own dysfunctions to situstional things (external) and attribute someone's success to external (luck) but our own success to internal (good at something) 
- [Daring Greatly](daring-greatly.md) and [Dare to Lead](dare-to-lead.md) both talk about the power of vulnerability. This guy talks about how vulnerability breeds trust.

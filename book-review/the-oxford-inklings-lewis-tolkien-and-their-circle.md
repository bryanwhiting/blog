	- creativity is grounded, not whimsical, thinking. Even scientists would agree as they become creative in the process of making new discoveries. If you need a creative mind to get to a new way of thinking (new theory that becomes truth), isn't the creative thinking truth itself? (Or rather it's not just whimsical).

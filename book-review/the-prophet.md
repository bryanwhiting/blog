- the weathervane: told the wind to stop bothering it. You're messing me up. 
	- The whole point of the weathervane is to give direction to the wind. 
	- Do I question the thing that gives me employment? Gives me work?
- The four poets: sometimes we all love to talk about something but don't actually enjoy it
- The four frogs: one of us wants to be right. We get angry with someone who tells us we're all right, as well as someone who doesn't want to challenge us - who won't play in our game. They're the enemy because They didn't stoop to our level and caught us in our vice. (There was a person I didn't like once but I now realize it's because they didn't stoop to my level )
- The stolen horse: we all accuse the victim. Why don't we focus on the stealer of a horse? We blame those who come to us for advice sometime.

- Don't see their role in your problems. 
- don't tell you about stuff. 
- Self referential vs self reflective 
- Expressing feelings wasn't condoned or supported. 
- Crying stops when given emotional support. "I'll give you something to cry about" 
- Focuses on facts and dive deep in intellectual topics but not emotions
- Overemphasize physical health â†’ we can feel as children a bond to those who took physical care of us but not emotional.

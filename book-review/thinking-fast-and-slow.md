- Interesting paper on "loss aversion". Golfers perceive putting for birdie as a foregone gain, but putting for par as something they cannot lose. So for the same distance, you're slightly more likely to sink the par than you are the birdie. https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Notes-This-figure-depicts-the-fraction-of-successful-par-and-birdie-putts-by-distance-to_fig2_229050997 
- endowment effect:
	- Losses are about 2x more painful than gains. 
	- utility for exchange vs use. You're likely to buy tickets at $500 and not be willing to sell them (if they're your favorite band) for $1500. Professor won't sell wine for cheaper than $100 than that he bought for 35
	- Benefits of buying something cheap vs negative emotion of 
	- Poor people are always losing. They're choosing between two losses. 
- Negative information overwhelms positives 5 to 1. Survival instincts. Loss aversion.

- planning fallacy and irrational perseverance. You know it's not going to happen but you continue anyway thinking you can beat it. → system 1 thinking. 
	- "We gave up rationality rather than giving up the enterprise"
- Inside view vs outside view. 
	- How long would it take to write a book? 2 years 
	- how did it take others? Are we better than them? What's the base rate?

Better planning:
- how long do you think it'll take?
- Why?
- What's a similar project in the past you've done?
- How long did it take you?

Bad planning:
- overestimate benefits, underestimate costs. Overestimate abilities, underestimate time it takes 

Validity: how predictable is the environment? How much time does the person have in the environment? What's the feedback loop? Anesthetist vs radiologist.

- confidence is a function of how coherent the story is in somebody's mind
- Simple formula 
- Recruit using 6 dimensions, with a 1-5 scale. Take the one with the highest score. 
- Intuition is recognition
- #BlogTopic: most of the advice we receive is from people just telling us how they did it, despite the fact there are hundreds of ways of doing it. 

Application:
- Why do I believe X model is good? Am I at risk of substitution: when you swap one piece of information for another

- Hindsight bias: makes you avoid thinking about the process of a decision and instead just keep guessing [How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices](how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.md) focuses on this

How to unbias an intuitive prediction allowing for regression to the mean 

Reading she and college grade. Reading age = 

1. Start with an estimate of average GPA (base rate)
2. Determine the GPA that matches your impression of the evidence (conjuctive average)
4. Estimate the correlation between your evidence and GPA (correlation between base rate and evidence's impact on base rate)
5. If your correlation is .30, move 30% of the distance between the average to the matching GPA (move from base rate to conjunctive base rate )

- regression to the mean: anyone who has outstanding performance will get highlighted. Then they'll do worse the next time period by nature. 
	- All data regresses to the mean. 
	- Some places spike with randomness. 
	- The overall trend

- anchoring. Also discussed in [Influence The Psychology of Persuasion](influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.md) and [Never Split the Difference](never-split-the-difference.md) - Ackerman method. 
	- Everyone is susceptible to this, judged of 15 years rolling a dice. 
	- First mover advantage in a negotiation. Don't allow the other person to set the anchor too extreme. 
- Normality. Recent crash of a plane will make you more skeptical to fly. 
	- If you see two accidents in one place, that's the "accident place"
- Availability bias: everyone thinks they do more than they actually do. → every team member wants a promotion. 
- "I do X a lot" → observation. We're bad at this observing point due to so many inherent biases. But the emotional thing of "I am good because I do that a lot" is a separate issue.

- positive emotions create cognitive ease, letting down the system 2 thinking. Happiness and creativity are linked. 
- Have your guard up if you're too much system 2. Try to get into the right system for the task. 
- Coherence: because there's a big event, it must have consequences. Because of consequences, there must be a causal effect. 
	- Saddam Housein captured. Stocks fall. Papers declare the link. 
- Priming. 
- Normality: what's normal? Things we see often. Even if they're rare.

- ego depletion. Cognitive tasks deain. 
- Default to easiest when hungry. 
- Familiarity. You're likely to believe something that's familiar. → benefit of reading books. You anchor to the familiar. 
- Reciprocal link. 
- Priming. It's a real thing. 
- Glucose raises with cognitive strain. → people do better on tests with poor font.

- substitution. Instead of "is ford a good stock" we ask "do I like ford?"
- People are not intuitive statisticians. They ignore the common biases. 
- Heuristics and biases are good shortcuts. 
- Illusion of the lines → you can't see them differently. But you can recognize the rules. This is true for statistical thinking → recognize the systems. 
- Attention blindness → when focused you can't see or hear around you. 
- Pupil shows the attention of the mind.

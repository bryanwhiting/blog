- I feel this could have been written today. 
- Safetyism. Words are harmful. 
- Screens > 2 hours a day increase risk of suicide. 
- Kids are being coddled. Over worked. Over engineered for top tier schools. But who says those schools produce successful people? What's the goal of getting into a top tier university? Will you really be better off in life? Most of the kids aren't able to handle life and enjoy it. 
- College has become a country club. Pay $100k/year. 
- Kids 
- Essentially, his theory is that universities are getting more fragile kids who are playing less, on social media more. They pursue safetyism. They give up liberties such as 
- Let your kid walk where is safe for them to do so. Avoid overprotection. 
	- Prepare kids. 
	- Free from adult guidance. 
	- Productive disagreement. Teach kids to argue productively. 
- "Talk with strangers, just never go off with them"

Adam grant on good conflict:

- Frame it as a debate rather than a conflict
- Argue as if you're right but listen as if you're wrong and be willing to change your mind 
- Give the most respectful interpretation of the other person's perspective
- Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you've learned from them. 

Your own thoughts unguarded.

- us vs them thinking 
- Labeling. 
- cognitive distortions. 
- Illogical gaps. 
- Tribalism. It's within us all. 
- The rhetoric in the world affects us all. We can overcome by paying heed. But the people who probably need to read this book don't. Same with any book: it's never received by the people who need it most, perhaps. 
- anti-fragility: don't want you to be safe. Want you to be strong. Armor. Don't want you to run. Want you to have the strength to overcome. 
- concept creep. 
- Don't defend the attacked. 
- "rallies are sometimes in the belief in a God, but always in the belief of a devil"

CBT: Emotional Reasoning, catastrophizing, labeling, Overgeneralising, black|white, mind reading, negative filtering, discounting positives, blaming

1. Emotional reasoning. Confusing feelings with thoughts or reality is a cognitive distortion.
3. Catastrophizing imagines a sequence of events. But it's seldom true. 
4. Overgeneralising. 
5. Dichotomous thinking. All or nothing thinking.
6. Mind reading
7. Labelling. Because someone belongs to a category doesn't mean they embody all the traits of that category.
8. Negative filtering. Amplifying negative signals, so it overwhelms the positive.
9. Discounting positives. Rationalising away positive evidence as if it doesn't count.
10. Blaming.

- tribalism. 
- CARE framework for responding to challenges. 
- Theory: we grow through being challenged, not the opposite. We are not our feelings. 
- Principle of charity: assume the best intent (not the worst)
- prepare the kid for the road, not the road for the kid. Life is the road. 
- People are afraid to speak up For fear of being cancelled.

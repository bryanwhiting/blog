Q: What is a HiPPO?  
A: HiPPO stands for "Highest Paid Person's Opinion."

Jim Barksdale, CEO of Netscape, famously said what could be summarized as [Data or HiPPO](https://twitter.com/ronnyk/status/732032265069330432), when he [said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/655987-if-we-have-data-let-s-look-at-data-if-all) "If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine."

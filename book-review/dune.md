## Great book

Love the storytelling. Herbert has a way of revealing things he narrates, observations, but holds the conclusions and insights to the individuals.

Makes you feel like you have superpowers as you read it. Am I a Fremen? An Atreities? It's fun to read and consider.

Thought provoking. Concepts of politics, religion, science, and diplomacy. War, worms, and wonder. Great read.

![Dune](../img/book-dune.jpeg){.preview-image}

- shield your son too much and he'll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny
- deprogram after the machines. Let the machines do too much thinking.
- humans must never submit to animals
- "how did the woman seal my tongue?" Paul can't tell his father he's going to die. Why? Sometimes our tongues are bound to speak that which can't be changed
- "the mind commands the body and it obeys. It commands itself and it rebels"

Connections:
- Alan Pinkerton [killers](../killers-of-the-flower-moonyfg%20if.md) "secrets break the character of the criminal till they give it out". Dr Yueh cries when his scripture is given out.  

Notes:
- if I made him do it it wouldn't be his doing.
- storytelling: why tell us 100% of everything up front? The movie hides the secrets about Yueh.
- storytelling: the hindsight narrator


When God has appointed a man to die, he guides his wants to desire that place


- you're remembered for what you fear
- Focusing too much on sight dulls the other senses
- We became weak on caladan
- Why beat yourself up after an emotional experience? What does it take to relevel yiur head.
- "Their minds rejected what they could not comprehend or encompass"
- Taking and giving force. a man loves the taking force, but he can't get into the giving force without being changed.
- Power changed Muaddib to not care about lost people. Why is that?

Storytelling
- How he explains their thoughts after subtle observations. He explains things through humanity, not through narration alone. This makes those points more salient. It's as if the dialogue is the content and the narration are the footnotes and context.

- Stilgar becoming a worshipper.
- Having lived billions upon billions of lives. Known cruelty.
- Trying to prevent the jihad, does he inevitably create it?

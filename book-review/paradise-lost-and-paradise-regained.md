- Satan delights in giving war, regardless if he can't win. 
- Satan delights in having raised war, feeling he is proud and strong for resisting good. Being courageous to walk out. But his courage only warranted misery. 
- "The mind is powerful. Can make heaven of hell or hell of heaven."
- Why would Satan want to walk away, knowing he was giving up godhood? What motivated him more than happiness?

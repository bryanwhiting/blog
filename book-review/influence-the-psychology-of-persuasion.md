Notes:

- complements go a long way. Spread good rumors. 
- Find similarities. 
- You gain back more than what you give. So give more.

- Rejection and retreat principle. Larger than smaller offers. 
- Contrast principle. 
- Reciprocity - people give more than they get out of a sense of burden. 
- Reciprocity - your good works are not lost if they're felt sincere. 

Liking:

- "it's impossible to change someone's belief with reasoning when they didn't use reasoning and logic to come to that belief in the first place"
- "You cannot reason a person out a position he did not reason himself into in the first place" - Jonathan Swift #quotes
- Liking: finding genuine similarities between you and the other. 
- In group vs out group
- Assigning labels, such as mascots or alter names

- Ackerman method from [Never Split the Difference](never-split-the-difference.md) applies to the concept of anchoring. Better to anchor at $2 then tell them $200 off than play a joke at $10000 but only offer $200. 
- Reciprocity - the small things compound over time. Give more than you expect to get. 
- "Because". Giving reasons is persuasive, that word is a trigger.

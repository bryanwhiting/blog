- thank goodness they're not as intelligent as those who kill them, though they're more noble and able
- Let him believe I am more man than I AM and I will be so
- "The thousand times he had proved it didn't matter now. He needs to prove it again anew that he's a man"
- Boy: "I have so much to learn from you" - after the boy has just gotten "lucky". 

Storytelling

- I love how he speaks a thought, then follows up with reality. Like "come on, catch the hook" "but the hook did not catch"
- Repetitive words used in new ways evoke new meaning
- Keep it simple. [Mark Cuban Mogul Support](../posts/mark-cuban-mogul-support.md) - don't use a big word when a simpler one will do. He evokes strong emotion without much fanciful language. 
- Your mind fills in the blanks. He encodes the intuition of 50 years of fishing in plain words. "I've got enough line..." is not a calculation. [Wool](wool.md) and [Dune](dune.md) are much more

- first you borrow. Then you beg. 
- "This too was a fiction"
- "Relics of his wife" - he waits to reveal his wife. 
- I was born for this. 
- He could think of nothing except endure

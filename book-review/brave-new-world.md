2024-04-04 summary

- This and [1984](1984.md) are two books everyone should read. This book was written 93 years ago and it's eerily prescient of what's happening in society. The pursuits of happiness and the role of the state and technology to those ends are evergreen topics. The pains that John felt entering a society but choosing true happiness over contrived ones. 
- Parallels today: people escaping to social media and TikTok like soma
- People wanting government to solve all their problems → the 20,000 alphas who wanted the government to step in
- People feeling adrift without an internal purpose and happy to just accept what comes their way or what society conditions them to believe → independent thinkers banished to islands
- Over optimization of Silicon Valley trying to optimize everything in their life 
- Linda and John's fates as they enter a world they don't belong to. Adrift. 
- Society gawking at the savage like we gawk at social media. 
- The whole thing just captures human behavior so brilliantly.

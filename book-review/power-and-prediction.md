- the between time. Lightbulb took 20 years before 50% of houses had it. 
	- ChatGPT 
- Point solutions 
	- lower cost of power. No change to factory system 
	- Can improve a single procedure without changing the system which embeds it. 
- Application 
	- Individual electric drives on each machine. Swappable. If one stops it doesn't stop the others. Modularity the factory but still keep it the same layout. 
	- Can enable a single thing to do more things. 
	- Enables a new procedure without changing the system in which it's embedded. 
- System solutions → change how the system is designed → steam vs electricity. Exploit by decoupling power source from factory element. → layout the machine how it's supposed to and get the power to where it is. 
	- Enables new procedures or changes existing procedures by changing dependent procedures. 


Ai point solution:
- improves a single decision without affecting other decisions 
AI Application solution 
- Enables new decision or changes how a decision is made without affecting other solutions 
AI system solution 
- Improves or enables new decisions only if changes to how decisions are made is implemented 

Chapter 3

- prediction: concert information you have to information you need 
- Ripe for adoption (business and customers are already familiar with risky decisions.) system shift: needs to change how people do things to be more efficient.

- what's at stake
	- Loss aversion. 
	- Create vulnerability
	- Specific call to action to resolve the risk.
- Transitional call to action: give something away for free. → establish yourself as a leader. Reciprocity. Give more away for free. They'll want to buy your workshop. [Influence The Psychology of Persuasion](influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.md)
- Three story endings
	- Win power or possession
	- Be unified with someone or something that makes them whole
	- experience Some self realization that makes them whole
- give them an **aspirational identity** and help them step into it. Identity transformation. 
	- The guide helps them identify their transformation. Help them set themselves apart. 
	- Identity transformation: from X to Y. 
- The only point of the site is to convert. 
- In machine learning, who is the hero? Is it the model? Who is the guide? Me? My boss is the hero. The model is the guide?
	- I think the model is the hero. I'm the guide to help it achieve its potential. Aspirational identity. 
- 5 marketing
	- Create a one line
	- Create a lead generator. Collect emails. Free pdf. Big. Video series. 
	- automated email drip campaign
	- Collect and tell stories about transformation 
	- Create a system to generate referrals

- customers don't care about your brand. They're the hero. Similar to [How to Win Friends and Influence People](how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.md) - "you?!? what about *me* you inconsiderate donkey"
- Clarity. We crave clarity. 
- Audience needs to know:
	- Who is the hero
	- what the hero wants
	- who/What the hero has to defeat to get what they want
	- What horrible thing will happen if they don't win, and what wonderful thing will happen if they do win. 
- Marketing
	- What does our customer want?
	- What problem we're helping them solve
	- What life will look like after they engage our product and services
- If you confuse, you lose. J
- 7 points
	- A character who wants something
	- encounters a problem before they can get it
	- At the peak of their despair, 
	- a guide enters their life and gives them a plan and 
	- calls them to action
	- That action helps them avoid failure and end in success
- Survival need
	- Create a story gap
	- Where will this brand take you
- The villain - dastardly
	- villain is a root source. Not a feeling. The thing that caused the villain. 
	- Villain is relatable 
	- Singular. One villain is enough. 
	- Villain is real. 
	- What product does your defeat?
- External problem
	- The frustrations in their life. What external problem do you solve that resolves a 
	- Apple: we solve customer frustration and intimidation
	- External: we paint your home. 
	- Internal: I have an ugly home
- External, internal, and philosophical problem
	- Luke needs to blow up Death Star (external) because he doesn't feel like he's good enough (internal) and he needs to defeat the evil empire (philosophical)
- Process plan: how they use your product 
- Agreement plan. 
- Call to action: ask them. 
	- Buy now. 
	- Chat with Bryan
	- Do you believe in your product? Brands need to offer solutions, not charity. 


Silvermine AI: 

- Thrive with AI
- "I was confused about AI... until I wasn't"
- confusion seeks for clarity. Get clarity. 
- villain: your competitor getting ahead because you don't use AI. 
	- Your wasted time. 
- External problem: they don't use AI
- Internal problem: they feel stupid and don't know how to use it right
- Philosophical: they want to have the best company
- Transformation: hapless → empowered with AI 


#### AI is your headache
AI is (or will shortly be) causing problems for you
"Hey, do you guys use AI?" No...why would we? → wrong answer. Quickest way to become a fossil. 

- How do I use it? Which tool?
- What's it doing? Risks?
- your customers are asking if you use it, and you don't have an answer

until it's your salve

Leave your industry in the dust.

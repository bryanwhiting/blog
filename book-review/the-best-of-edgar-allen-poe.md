# Raw Notes

The Tell-Tale Heart:

- you think me mad. Nah, I'm cool. But the man grows increasingly mad.
- guilt follows the commission, before then the guilt is only in the hesrt. After it consumes.  
 
The Cask of Amontillado:

- watch your pride. Don't let it trick you into walking into catacombs
   
The Masque of the Red Death:

- fruitless to avoid it
- allegory of phases of life
- Prince Prospero tries to fight death, but dies in the process
  
The Raven

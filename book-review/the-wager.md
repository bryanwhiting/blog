- Cape horn! Crazy. 

> The Scottish man you're referring to is Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean, now known as Robinson Crusoe Island, part of the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands off the coast of Chile. Selkirk lived alone on the island from 1704 to 1709. His story is believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe's novel "Robinson Crusoe." Selkirk was a skilled navigator and sailor, and his survival skills, including hunting, gathering, and shelter building, allowed him to survive until he was eventually rescued by an English ship. His experience highlights the human capacity for adaptation and survival in extreme conditions.

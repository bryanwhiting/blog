List of reasons why I write this blog and principles I aspire to. They evolve over time, and I like to keep track.

- Write every day (Seth Godin style). Many posts will be bad. But higher repetitions means better writing. 
- Learn by writing. Synthesis only happens when sharing. 
- Write first, edit later. 
- Use writing to actively digest world news. Doomscrolling is futile and anxiety inducing. Writing and synthesizing helps me comparmentalize the world and where I fit into it. 
- Develop an opinion. Strong opinions, weakly held. A ship is better heading in any direction than none at all. An opinion is a direction. 
- Every post is a story. If it's not a story, it's not worth reading. 
- I am me. I write what's on my mind. I hope it's interesting to different people in different ways. 
- Write each post for one real person in my life, based on one real discussion. 
- Gratitude is healing, produces optimism, and reveals a new way. Give thanks daily. I give thanks, therefore I have.

- All blogs are wrong, but some are useful (riff on George Box's quote that all models are wrong)

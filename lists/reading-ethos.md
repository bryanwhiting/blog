- [The Power of a Good Book](../posts/the-power-of-a-good-book.md) - read a lot find the stuff worth reading.

- Give the book one hour. if it's not great, then move on.
	- Aim to finish 30% of all books started? (Debating this.) 
	- There are a million books and a million recommendations. 
	- Not all books are worth the time though. Perhaps I've already learned that lesson. Perhaps it's just not enjoyable, or I don't like the author's style. In these moments I wonder: what does this book being popular tell me about society? (There's always something to be learned.)
- The good *stuff* sticks. 
	- Note taking is interesting. 
- Fiction is more powerful for philosophy than anything
	- putting philosophy next to characters living it is better than just listening to ["Socrates A Life Worth Living" by Devra Lehman](../book-review/socrates-a-life-worth-living.md) and hearing back and forth arguments. 
- Read things I'm not interested in 
	- the best book on cooking. The best book on nascar, etc. I don't need to be an expert in everything, but to pick a random field and get the best book in that field can open my mind up.

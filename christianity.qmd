I'm a Christian, which means I believe in a Savior and Messiah who was born miraculously, lived perfectly, gave His life selflessly, and resurrected divinely so that there's hope in a world beyond for all of us. He was the perfect example of how to treat everyone with kindness, respect, and decency.  From a leadership perspective, he taught how to think deeply, lead unconventionally, and challenge individuals to live life with selfless purpose. His life is filled with a richness worth studying. These are some ideas I have while trying to understand who He is.

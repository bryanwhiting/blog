# Scriptures

Isaiah is describing how people can be so selfish that they "rob the fatherless" and make the "widows their prey"

> And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?  4 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
> [2 Nephi 20.3â€“4](../scriptures/2-nephi-20.3-4)

# Meaning

One who is mercury is one who is willing to help those whom he has deemed lost. 

Christ is merciful. We are all lost in many ways, meaning we're all works in progress. "His hands are outstretched still".

  <title>1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/receiving-a-promised-land.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>While Lehi wandered in the wilderness, Nephi recounted he left the “land of his inheritance”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.4">1 Nephi 2.4</a></p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Leaving the promised land</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Yet by the end of the Chapter, Nephi is promised a land of inheritance:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.20">1 Nephi 2.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing how they lose one thing but gain another. Also amazing is how they had prophets warning them of Jerusalem’s destruction - why didn’t the Lord make <em>those</em> prophets leave?</p>
<p>He has a plan for us individually.</p>
<p>CS Lewis remarked something along the lines of “We don’t chase God, God chases us”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Both Malcolm Muggeridge and C.S. Lewis attest to this. Muggeridge wrote, “I had a notion that somehow, besides questing, I was being pursued.” Lewis said that, “…night after night…I sensed the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. Finally, I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed…” (<a href="https://www.stettlerindependent.com/community/man-can-not-sidestep-thinking-about-god-faith-and-reflection-6606319">link</a>, also discussed in <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a>)</p>

<p>Kid screaming? why?</p>
<p>Milk on the floor? why is that a funny thing?</p>
<p>Poop on the ground? (<a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a>) It won’t last. it’s endearing.</p>
<p>No, this isn’t just fanciful thinking - this is a choice. You’ve chosen to be angry at that spilled milk, lost your cool when bro slapped sis, and walked out of the room when you heard that last cry for “more breakfast!!”.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> did you get overwhelmed? Stressed about all there is to do, and now there’s one more thing? Stressed about “am i a good parent”? Stressed about raising your kids right and you have to instruct them on everything they do wrong in order to do that?</p>
<p>My new philosophy: Kids are kids. They’re optimizers. Anyone in tech knows that an optimizer is a thing trying to find the optimal point of another thing. It’s like battleships - you keep guessing until you find. Then you guess around until you get all the points, until you know where to look.</p>
<p>Kids do this all day. They say something crazy trying to get a reaction. They say a not-funny joke 100 times until it’s funny again. Humans do that too.</p>
<p>So they’re optimizing. Exploring. Exploiting. That’s all their doing - exploring the space, exploiting the emotional signal.</p>
<p>Knowing that, find the fun in the moment. They won’t always be like this. And when it’s gone, you’ll wish it wasn’t. <a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a></p>

  <title>He prepares us to teach us</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/he-prepares-us-to-teach-us.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Consider this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen. And being <strong>thus</strong> overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.7-8">1 Nephi 1.7–8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cause and effect. First: he was overcome by the spirit. Second, he had a vision.</p>
<p>But that’s not how the vision came. First, it began with prayer.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.5-6">1 Nephi 1.5–6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here’s the order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lehi listens to prophets that Jerusalem will be destroyed (4)</li>
<li>Lehi prays for his people, hoping they won’t be (5)</li>
<li>Lehi sees a pillar of fire, sees many things (6)</li>
<li>Lehi returns home (assumes he’s not home), and is overcome with what he saw (7)</li>
<li>Lehi then has another, more pronounced vision (8)</li>
</ol>
<p>What a way to start off the Book of Mormon: this is a book about personal revelation, written by people who had revelations, and it teaches us the pattern. In this case, we care about others. When we do, the heavens open as we pray.</p>
<p>We prob won’t have visions, but we <em>will</em> have the spirit.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for <strong>unto him that receiveth I will give more</strong> <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-28.30">2 Nephi 28.30</a></p>

  <title>Praying for Other People</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This scripture stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.5">1 Nephi 1.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many verses like this, such as Enos praying for his people, or Christ saying “Oh Jerusalem”, or Enoch.</p>
<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> right now and considered just how influenced these authors were by their surroundings. WWI, the rise of machines, etc.</p>
<p>Aren’t we all influenced by the people around us? What role do those people play in our lives? What role do the loved ones play in our lives? What role do we play in theirs?</p>

  <title>Scriptures within Scriptures</title>

<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-white-fruit-delicious-zoom-in.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The Scriptures are precious and worth our time</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Nephi recounts how they had obtained some scriptures:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And <strong>we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us</strong>, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.21">1 Nephi 5.21</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few things that stand out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>He thought about his children. In <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-25.26">2 Nephi 25.26</a> it’s mentioned “that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.”</li>
<li>They had the scriptures because they accomplished the task laid before them, “I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-3.7.html">1 Nephi 3.7</a></li>
<li>These scriptures were “desirable”. Know what else is desirable? The fruit of the tree of life:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-8.10">1 Nephi 8.10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, are precious to help our families know of Christ, have been obtained and written by those obedient to Christ, and are desirable and great to consume.</p>
<p>In <a href="../tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.html">A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media</a>, I talk about how tech workers talk of social media as “snackable content”. Frequently the word “consumption” is used to describe how app “users” “consume” content.</p>
<p>It’s mostly not the stuff worth consuming in great quantities. Don’t settle for snacks. Enjoy a feast:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, do not spend <strong>money</strong> for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and <strong>feast upon that which perisheth not</strong>, neither can be corrupted, and <strong>let your soul delight in fatness.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-9.51">2 Nephi 9.51</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Replace “money” with “time”.</em></p>

  <title>My testimony: Moving across the Country</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/my-testimony-2024-01-07.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>Today is fast Sunday, a day when testimonies are shared in church. Here’s my testimony I shared today. Someone had just spoken about moving to a new place and seeing God in their lives, even if it was far away from where they had thought they needed to be. They had moved away from family.</em></p>
<p>I was reminded today of why I live where I do. Without going into personal details, as a family we decided it was time to leave the east coast and move west. As I wondered how it might be possible, I was encouraged by my wife to reach out to an old contact on a random spreadsheet I had kept seven years prior when I was first looking for jobs. The guy had since changed jobs from when he had interviewed me, but he referred me to his new company.</p>
<p>Well, this company was otherwise impossible to get noticed at, even with referrals. Turns out this guy was a lot higher than I had known. It was enough to get me the first interview. Four years later we’re still on the west coast. It’s definitely a better situation for our family in many ways.</p>

<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-u-haul-moving.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Moving because when we had a desire, the Lord opened the door for us</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And in terms of family, I grew up living far away from cousins. My church congregation became my family. My parents friends became my Sunday school teachers and mentors. My friends at church became my closest confidants and kept me company in living the principles I believed in.</p>
<p>Recently, this church family helped us with meals, gifts, and emotional warmth. I don’t know what I’d do without belonging to a group of people who care for one another (I know many communities are like this, but I think it’s extra special in a Christian context where everyone wants to help and strengthen each other in kindness. We all try their best.)</p>
<p>Christ’s design that we have a church is inspired:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is <strong>one body, and one Spirit</strong>, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. <a href="../scriptures/ephesians-4.4-6">Ephesians 4.4–6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And are we not all family? The spiritual children of Christ and sons and daughters of Heavenly Father.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made <strong>ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters;</strong> for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters. … therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ… <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-5.7-8">Mosiah 5.7–8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I testify the <a href="../concepts/hand-of-god.html">Hand of God</a> is real. He leads and guides people to where they need to be gathered. And when we gather together as one body, miracles happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>I also love this scripture, how Lehi was guided to a “land of promise”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>behold, I <strong>have obtained</strong> a land of promise <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5">1 Nephi 5.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He wrote “have obtained” while he was struggling for food and water in the desert. He saw ahead to when he’d eventually live in a near rain forest paradise.</p>

  <title>What does it mean to preside?</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/what-does-it-mean-to-preside.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The responsibility of a Father is to preside:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By divine design, <strong>fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness</strong> and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. <a href="../scriptures/the-family-proclamation">The Family Proclamation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve long wondered what this meant. Earlier in my marriage I wondered: does this mean a father leads all family gatherings, has the first or last word, or delegates who says the prayer? That’s probably because the word “preside” is used synonymously with lead with respect to church callings and such:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Verily, I say unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts, there must needs be presiding elders to <strong>preside</strong> over those who are of the office of an elder; And also priests to <strong>preside</strong> over those who are of the office of a priest; 62 And also teachers to preside <strong>over</strong> those who are of the office of a teacher, in like manner, and also the deacons <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-107.60-62">Doctrine and Covenants 107.60–62</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never really wondered if this was “who calls the shots”, or “who runs the show” - that never felt like a thing because my father is a gentle, servant leader. But I know some wonder what the details of this phrase mean. And what does it mean for single moms?</p>
<p>Well, I recently learned what <em>I</em> think it means. I started getting slightly more-than-average stressed with being sleep deprived after having a newborn.</p>
<p>I noticed, by consequence, my kids appeared more agitated. I remembered my <a href="../posts/your-mood-is-contagious.html">Mood is Contagious</a>.</p>
<p>Once I got more sleep, I realized the kids model my behavior as a father than follow my words. The way I talk to them is how they talk to each other - for better or worse.</p>
<p>Every parent knows this.</p>
<p>So while “preside” technically means to lead a meeting, it also means to lead a gathering. Is a family not a gathering?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>…how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you. And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, <a href="../scriptures/3-nephi-10.4-5">3 Nephi 10.4–5</a></p>

<p>Every chapel I’ve been in has a vaulted, high ceiling. This is common across many church architectures.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the stable where he was born. It reminds me of above, how he came down. It reminds me that there’s space for everyone. Even if it’s crowded on the ground, there’s a ton of space Above. This is why he came: to make space for all of us.</p>

  <title>How I use the Book of Mormon</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/how-to-use-the-book-of-mormon.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Book of Mormon is the most powerful book I’ve read.</p>
<p>This is how I get the most out of the book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye <strong>must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father</strong> in the name of Christ, that <strong>he will consecrate thy performance unto thee</strong>, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9">2 Nephi 32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve read a lot of self help books. It’s not like that. This is a book that inspires personal revelation and a relationship with Christ and Heavenly Father. I get the most out of it when I have a true desire in my heart:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a <strong>sincere heart, with real intent,</strong> having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. <a href="../scriptures/moroni-10.4">Moroni 10.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I read it in a rush, I don’t get much out of it. When I don’t pray before hand, or if I’m not sincere, I don’t really get anything substantive.</p>
<p>It’s like texting vs calling a friend. If you’re in a rush, you give a half thought text. But if you’re on a long drive and want to build a relationship, you give the friend a call.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-plant-a-seed-and-grow.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">If you plant a seed, you need to nourish it</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The best insight doesn’t come from the Book of Mormon. It comes from the Holy Ghost. So I can read the book as a literary critique and not see its divinity. But as I read it trying to build a relationship with Heavenly Father, then I feel that relationship grow.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be <strong>planted in your heart</strong>, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it <strong>beginneth to be delicious to me.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/alma-32.28">Alma 32.28</a></p>

  <title>When a Person Changes their Perspective on Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/a-change-in-witness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Book of Mormon had 12 witnesses of its divinity - the three spiritual testimonies by the Three Witnesses, the Eight Witnesses with a physical witness, and Joseph Smith, the one who translated it as prophet, seer, and revelator. Powerfully, all Three Witnesses left the church years later (1937/38) nearly 8-9 years after writing their testimony (1829), but never left their testimonies:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Despite differences with Joseph Smith that led each of the Three Witnesses to part ways individually with the Church (Cowdery and Harris later returned), they continued to affirm their testimony as witnesses throughout their lives. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/witnesses-of-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng&amp;id=html">Witnesses of the Book of Mormon</a></p>
</blockquote>
<section id="when-a-loved-one-leaves-their-testimony" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>When a loved one leaves their testimony</h1>
<p>Let’s consider the world where these three denied their testimonies. (It’s easy to see that they “never doubted their own witness, therefore it must be true”.) But I think this is a sandy foundation because a thing should be true regardless of what three individuals say about it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-three-witnesses-one-missing.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">What if one had forsaken their testimony - would you still believe he saw it?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Those who believe in Christ hold strong beliefs in Him, and it must be a belief because they cannot see Him. They rely on the faith built on personal witness and also built by the testimony of others. But what do you do when a loved one abandons their testimony, or becomes an <a href="../book-review/unbelievable.html">unbeliever</a>? Do you doubt everything you learned from them? Perhaps.</p>
<p>Who do you trust - the “them” now that un-believes, or the “them” <em>then</em> that once believed?</p>
<p>Consider a hard-and-fast alternative: what if someone began doubting the existence of gravity? What if they were once your physics professor? Easy: you just go to the apple tree and demonstrate the principle by dropping an apple. “No, that’s magnetism”, the professor now claims.</p>
<p>You’re kind of stuck: well, if you think it’s magnetism, there’s not much I can do - this concept is called gravity. Similarly, people leave God’s path and believe the Hand of God that acts in their live is now, and always has been, just coincidence, luck, etc. what else could it be?</p>
<p>But what is coincidence? Luck? (I ponder these things often as a statistician. For another time…)</p>
</section>
<section id="putting-a-name-on-a-concept" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Putting a name on a Concept</h1>
<p>There’s precedence for this - when Ammon appeared to the Lamanites, they thought he acted by the Great Spirit. Instead of telling them they were wrong, he instead clarified, “that great spirit <em>is</em> God”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>26 And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great Spirit? 27 And he said, Yea. 28 And Ammon said: This is God. And Ammon said unto him again: Believest thou that this Great Spirit, who is God, created all things which are in heaven and in the earth?<br>
<a href="../scriptures/alma-18.26-28">Alma 18.26–28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, when unbelievers doubt the Hand of God, or re-cast their old ways according to a <em>new</em> belief framework, perhaps they’re just labeling a concept in a different way. (It’s also really hard to know what someone once considered “God” vs not in their life, so take this point with a grain of salt.)</p>
<p>After all, when people leave God some claim they were under <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/unbelievable/ch4.html">confirmation bias</a>, the concept that you favor the evidence that supports your belief. Hyndman argues confirmation bias can go both ways, for believers and unbelievers, but <em>does</em> claim that evidence favors the skeptics because there should be evidence. I’d argue he relies solely on <em>physical</em> evidence. There is <em>spiritual</em> evidence to be considered. <em>Spiritual</em> evidence is what we believe in. It’s what the Three Witnesses relied on. It’s unprovable to anyone else, and only receivable by the Holy Ghost. If God exists, let Him reveal himself. Let Him prevail:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But whom say ye that I am? 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for <strong>flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</strong><br>
<a href="../scriptures/matthew-16.15-17">Matthew 16.15–17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most powerful thing about being a Christian is that <em>it cannot be proven</em> Christ <em>didn’t</em> exist or walk the earth. Even if you falsify the entire bible, erase history, or discover that “Mary” was an invented concept by some creed or counsel bound to oppress us - there’s still a question: did the Man exist? We can debate it. Pharisees debated if He was That Messiah. Nobody now can know, except God reveals it to them.</p>
<p>Why? Because to claim God doesn’t exist, or the plates weren’t real, you’d also have to have evidence. Counter-evidence <em>isn’t</em> evidence. Lack of evidence likewise. Don’t we continually find new fossils? New animals in the wild? Lack of evidence doesn’t mean they don’t exist.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The other side may say (as Hyndman) does), I might as well believe in the Tooth Fairy, or Santa, because I don’t have evidence they don’t exist. Fair. Then belief is a choice, and must follow the principle of “by their fruits ye shall know them”. Did Baal call down Fire? No, only Elijah’s God. “Was that story of the Bible invented?” Perhaps. If so, explain why living Christ’s gospel brings me joy? “Because they’re good principles”, well, what is good, if not God? “Well then why not Zeus, or Baal to be your God?”, because I believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - not the God of Baal. I believe the scriptures because they teach good things. “What about the misogyny, racism, war and killing in the Bible etc etc etc”, well, perhaps some was commanded by God for reasons and context we don’t have. Perhaps some of the Bible isn’t truely written. “If some isn’t true it’s all not true because parts of it say it’s all true”. Well, what’s true is true, what’s not isn’t. “Who’s to say what God inspired?” Well, who’s to say what’s not inspired? Only God. “We’re not getting anywhere”. Ahh, but we are. Because I believe in God, and after believing Him I exercised faith in His son to pray on His name and open myself to trying to follow His ways. I’m far from perfect, but once I did this, I received spiritual knowledge, and having seen more of the Hand of God in my life, I can say there are miracles of events I can’t explain by chance or delusion alone. Miracles only a loving God could produce. This is my knowledge, which follows faith. <a href="../scriptures/alma-32.34-36">Alma 32.34–36</a> And we also have the Book of Mormon, which is a powerful second witness of Christ that brought reality to the truth in the Bible, and continually helps me feel the fruits of the Spirit, which is the Holy Ghost telling me it’s true.</p></li><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;my whole life until 21 I had no idea Joseph Smith had so many (up to 42) wives. “Some say he was a womanizer, pimp, etc”. Perhaps. But perhaps he was a prophet commanded to do so. Were we there? God at one point commanded Abraham to raise seed and have many wives. “Maybe Abraham was a philanderer too.” Okay, but does that definition of chastity and virtue not depend on the very construction of marriage as ordained by God who married Adam and Eve as husband and wife? If it’s from God, it’s His law, and He chose the rules. “But Joseph altered the rules and made stuff up so he could get with women and teenagers.” Perhaps. That assumes we know him, he told us that, and he believed it to be true. So we’ll leave it as an opinion. In my opinion he followed a commandment from an Angel, despite me not understanding it entirely or being comfortable with the idea. Let the man speak for himself.</p></li></div><p>To prove the Abrahamic God doesn’t exist people just say “well I found all this stuff about the bible, about church leaders, etc” was wrong or misconstrued. So? First, we have to make sure the “new stuff” learned is actually true (could be a lie), but if it is true (that something you once believed is a lie or misunderstanding) we must find out how this fits into Christ’s bigger picture.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>You can’t claim that Joseph Smith <em>didn’t</em> see God and that the <em>Three Witnesses</em> <em>didn’t</em> see the plates at some point. Because you weren’t there in 1829. Even if they <em>had</em> later denied, from reading <a href="../book-review/killers-of-the-flower-moon.html">Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI</a>, it’s quite clear how people can be manipulated in the courts of law, influenced by money, influenced by their own delusions, etc. Since delusions go both ways, relying on people at all isn’t how we learn the existence of a Divine. Peter learned of Christ’s divinity the way we all must (quote above). Show me the evidence, says the scientist in me: the <em>spiritual</em> evidence. # Flip Floppers on Both Sides</p>
<p>Floppers flip both ways. The quote above said another way: who’s witness do you trust - the <em>you</em> of today, the <em>you</em> of yesterday, or the <em>you</em> of tomorrow? We can all come and go with our testimonies. This is life. We must have an unalterable way to learn truth, one independent of our path.</p>
<p>We’ve got the Paul’s of the world who were once Christian persecutors who flip to believers, and we’ve got those who claimed Joseph Smith was a fallen prophet after being in vision with him.</p>
<p>We’re all more like Laman and Lemuel than we realize. We see things that make us believe, we come to God, and then we forget and wonder if they never happened.</p>
<p>We’re all flip floppers. Let us not seek truth alone from others, or even rely solely on the Prophet. Our testimonies must be on Christ, and learning truth by the Holy Ghost, who will then guide us to understand the words of prophets and imperfect leaders. It’s good science.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives">“Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m glad the Three Witnesses never denied their testimonies, but I’m glad there’s a way to know the Book of Mormon is true without them. After all, those dudes didn’t answer my prayer about the book’s truth. Heavenly Father did.</p>

  <title>Love Thy Neighbor, But Have Friends</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/love-thy-neighbor-but-have-friends.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Christ invited us to love our neighbors:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord. <a href="../scriptures/leviticus-19.18">Leviticus 19.18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But He himself had his friends: his disciples. He didn’t try hanging out with the Pharisees or the Romans. He spent time at dinner with his apostles and followers.</p>
<p>He had four brothers. Did he call them to apostleship? No.&nbsp;Did he <em>not</em> love them? No, he loved them.</p>
<p>He loved the Roman as much as he loved John the Beloved: enough to die for them and prepare the way for them to rejoin him in heaven.</p>
<p>But he also spent time with those he loved. What does this teach us about love?</p>

  <title>Share your testimony</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>At least a dozen people claimed to have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>There were the “Three Witnesses”, the “Eight Witnesses”, Emma Smith, Joseph Smith, and perhaps a few others.</p>
<p>What’s powerful to me is this testimony that the Eight shared:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it. <a href="../scriptures/testimony-of-eight-witnesses">Testimony of Eight Witnesses</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admire any who live with such conviction. It calls to mind the John Hancock’s of the world.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: <a href="../scriptures/testimony-of-eight-witnesses">Testimony of Eight Witnesses</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re invited to “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in,” (<a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.9">Mosiah 18.9</a>), to share what we’ve seen.</p>
<p>May we stand boldly, which doesn’t mean confrontational, contentiously, or loudly. It just means unequivocally. Sincerely.</p>

<p>I’ve been a member of this church, also known as the Mormon church, my whole life. I’ve studied it, learned its history, and have come to believe that it provides a marvelous sense of purpose and guidance. I believe it teaches the most truth about Jesus Christ and His plan of happiness for us, and I believe it’s people (including my own) have a lot to learn from those teachings.</p>

  <title>The Miracles of Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/the-miracles-of-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m reading the Book of Mormon this year with the Come Follow Me (by <a href="../christianity/the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.html">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>) curriculum. I hope you enjoy as I write something I learn each day.</p>
<p>I’ll tag things “scripture of the day” for any one-scripture thoughts. If it’s related to the Come Follow Me theme, l’ll add a tag.</p>
<section id="miracles-of-christ" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Miracles of Christ</h1>
<p>This scripture caught me eye:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, <strong>working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-3.5">Mosiah 3.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-christ-healing-clay.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Christ healing all who come unto him</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I have seen miracles in my life. I’ve also seen collateral-miracles, which is the miracle that happens when you’re expecting one thing but another thing happens instead.</p>
<p>I’ve seen someone healed from a Priesthood blessing. I’ve seen someone healed from depression. I’ve seen someone healed from doubt and disbelief. I’ve felt the power of the Holy Ghost in my life.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen people not healed, left to the struggles we all face, and yet miracles abound.</p>
<p>So what is a miracle? Is it an outcome? No.&nbsp;It’s the process of seeing how an event can be changed by God for the benefit of an individual. Occasionally, there are supernatural changes in the natural course of things.</p>
<p>If any of these things sounds fanciful to those not of my Church, it’s actually a lot more simple and plain than it sounds. Because “the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a <strong>still small voice</strong>.” (<a href="../scriptures/1-kings-19.11-12">1 Kings 19.11–12</a>) For me, seeing a miracle of Christ is perceiving the hand by how he operates.</p>
<p>Some have a hard time reading the Old Testament because how can a God who brought fire from heaven, parted the seas, gave manna from heaven also be a God who doesn’t do those things today?</p>
<p>I’d argue the miracles of Christ have risen to the point where he works according to our knowledge and insight. I believe in a Christ who is the source of all truth, and who teaches truth (even scientific) to everyone, regardless of their belief system. <a href="../scriptures/matthew-5.45">Matthew 5.45</a></p>
<p>And so, the miracles of God today are happening within science. Within tech. He doesn’t have to heal us by God’s power if he gave us medicine to do the same.</p>
<p>He also doesn’t show his miracles the same way. The people of the Old Testament were simple. They needed signs. But signs aren’t faith, and I believe these days before His second coming are days of greater faith. Days where we’ll have fewer signs.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Therefore, <strong>blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble</strong>; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe. Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe. 18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it. <a href="../scriptures/alma-32.16-18">Alma 32.16–18</a></p>

<li>Why would Christ use these words? They’re Greek. Why not Hebrew?</li>

<p>This teaches me that Christ speaks the language of those whom he’s speaking to.</p>

<p>This post speaks to how I manage spiritual doubts, such as whether God exists. It got me thinking after reading a few religious posts by <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/unbelievable/ch1.html">Rob Hybdman</a>, someone whose professional (data science) work I greatly admire.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of some points I try to make here:</p>
<ul>
<li>He doesn’t try to convince us to believe Him without a doubt, He asks us to follow him</li>
<li>People who saw Christ didn’t even recognize Him as the Savior</li>
<li>Christianity is hard to grasp and won’t make total sense when you think deeply about it.</li>
<li>Our job is to keep learning, and ask Him to teach us about His nature</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I think too many people grow up thinking of God in black/white terms and when one, linking piece of the puzzle doesn’t fit or is missing, some throw Him out all together. Here’s my take on why people misrepresent God, and how this can lead to personal doubts of faith in Him and His Son.</p>

<section id="an-unknown-god" class="level1">
<h1>An unknown God</h1>
<p>A certain philosopher named Korihor once reasoned that people should stop paying tithing or following restrictive religious commandments because they’re wasting their time. Here’s his thinking:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, ==by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions== and their ==pretended mysteries==, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, ==offend some unknown being, who they say is God==—a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be. - <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?id=p28&amp;lang=eng#p28">Alma 30:28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this because the argument of whether God exists or if Christ was the Savior is nothing new. (And many people I highly regard and esteem are tackling this “new” issue head on, as many in the world are questioning their faith.) But a lot of the same arguments that have existed continue to exist: why believe?</p>
<p>…It’s not like anyone’s ever seen God anyway.</p>
<p>Let’s assume for a minute that they have seen God. They saw His Son, His mortal example, walk the earth (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/5?id=p19&amp;lang=eng#p19">John 5:19</a>).</p>
<p>While with His disciples, Christ himself took a moment to reflect on who people thought he was, and whether people actually recognized Him for who He is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When Jesus came into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, ==Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?== And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16?id=p13-p14&amp;lang=eng#p13">Matthews 16:13-14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People had no idea who Christ was even though I’d bet either He or His disciples them His name many times while He was healing them.</p>
<p>People are funny like that.</p>
<p>Consider your own life. Have you ever misinterpreted a situation, even as it’s being explained to you?</p>
<p>Let’s consider a magician who does a magic trick for you. She doesn’t show you how it’s done, but she does explain it to you with only words. Since you don’t specifically see how the magic trick is done, perhaps your mind wanders and you doubt what really happened.</p>
<p>Do you trust the Magician? When He tells you who He is, after healing you, do you believe Him? When an unexplainable coincidence happens in your life, what do you chalk it up to?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Nah, that’s so highly improbable it must just be <em>luck</em>”… (whatever <em>luck</em> is…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t imagine how it must have felt for people around Christ to be healed by rubbing mud on their eyes or washing in a river a few times or, or, … I can only honestly believe these people felt absolute wonder to the point of mental disassociation. How else do you mentally cope with being a paralytic your whole life and then you’re able to walk?</p>
<p>It’s entirely reasonable, then, that they just figured He must be like the other miracle workers they knew - Elias, John the Baptist, etc. They try to frame Him in their believable mental reference, i.e., “luck”.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-strange-god" class="level1">
<h1>A strange God</h1>
<p>Perhaps though we can relate to when Paul, a lifelong Non-Christian <em>and</em> Christian persecuter, preached to his fellow Gentiles:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. 17 Therefore ==disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews==, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. 18 ==Then certain philosophers== of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, ==What will this babbler say?== other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/17?id=p16&amp;lang=eng#p16">Acts 17:16-18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul got them. He was once like them: a gentile. An unbeliever. A <em>disbeliever</em>. But he eventually was converted to knowing Christ, and, as such, appeared to seem like a babbler when trying to talk to people who once were like him. They considered him and his teachings strange:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, ==May we know what this new doctrine==, whereof thou speakest, is? 20 For ==thou bringest certain strange things to our ears==: we would know therefore what these things mean. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/17?id=p19&amp;lang=eng#p19">Acts 16:19-20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meeting Christ can be strange.</p>
<p>Understanding him, so too.</p>
</section>
<section id="putting-a-box-on-god" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Putting a box on God</h1>
<p>Consider the question, “why does God let good people suffer?”</p>
<p>(Other important questions like, “why did God encourage Abraham/Isaac/Israel to be polygamists but Adam not?”, or “why did God restrict the <em>entire</em> earth from receiving his Gospel until <em>after</em> Christ died, commanding His <em>people</em> not to marry or mingle with <em>them</em> but then change his tone ~33 AD?”, are worth similar consideration.)</p>
<p>It’s a false dichotomy: if God exists and loves us, He surely wouldn’t let us suffer. If suffering exists, especially of <em>good</em><sup>1</sup> people, God must not then exist.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;What is Good without God?</p></li><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The world is filled with unjust, seemingly unnecessary suffering. Consider innocent children starving across the world, being bombed in Gaza/raped in Israel, bombed in Ukraine, Yemen, gassed in Germany in the Holocaust, starved in Stalin’s camps, nuked by the United States in Japan, etc, etc, etc. (I sincerely don’t write this easily, nor to make light of the suffering.) all of the suffering is horrible. But it doesn’t for a moment mean God doesn’t exist. It actually affirms His existence, because if evil exists the opposite of evil must too.</p></li><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I don’t mean that in the Marxist political sense, because who’s to declare who’s suffering at any given moment? Is an affluent child born with cancer not a sufferer despite them not being poor?</p></li></div><p>Consider all the suffering of innocent children<sup>2</sup>. The reality of human nature is sufferers vs non sufferers<sup>3</sup>. Any suffering is painful to bear, and nobody better understands this than Christ himself (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19?id=p16-p19&amp;lang=eng#p16">D&amp;C 19:16-19</a>).</p>
<p>The point is, we can falsely equivocate that because God loves us and He had the power to stop suffering, He should stop it.</p>
<p>Do you do this with any other relationship? Consider the hypothetical:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Father Joe loves his children. But Joe let his son Bob get hit with a toy by little sister Susie. Joe let Susie suffer. Therefore, Joe acted in an evil and therefore does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This line of thinking is absurd to anyone with a brain, let alone to anyone who is a parent. They understand that sufferig is part of life, can be good for teaching, and that it doesn’t mean the parent doesn’t exist. <em>Yet sometimes we wonder if God exists because we’re suffering.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="consider-alternative-viewpoints" class="level1">
<h1>Consider alternative viewpoints</h1>
<p>To be comfortable with unanswered questions from a yet unknown God, we should consider how the question is already answered.</p>
<p>For example, did God stop Christ from suffering? No.&nbsp;Did Christ stop himself from suffering on the cross when He had the power to turn water to wine for the thirsty, heal the suffering swordsman’s ear, or even raise Himself from the dead?</p>
<p>I’m trying to rally around the point: we set up for ourselves false philosophical arguments about who or what God is and should be like when there’s a lot of nuance to be considered.</p>
<p>In my view, He’s more of a Magician who “explains but doesn’t show” than one who tries “to convince us about every little thing”. Because it’s quite human to be like “oh, yea that magic trick isn’t cool anymore” once you understand it. And His goal is to invite us to <em>believe</em> His son so that we’ll <em>follow</em> Him. His goal isn’t for us to know <em>everything</em>, though he <em>is</em> willing to teach us a lot. Remember: “ask and ye <em>shall</em> receive”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit…and let us reason together, ==that ye may understand;== <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50?id=p10&amp;lang=eng#p10">D&amp;C 50:10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He just didn’t say <em>when</em> He’d tell us.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-he-explains-but-doesnt-try-to-convince" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Why he explains but doesn’t try to convince</h1>
<p>Why do I believe that He likes to explain but not convince? A few ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He taught people they would get to heaven by eating His flesh (sacrament), and people misunderstood and thought this was a “hard” teaching. They walked no more with him (John 6), but he didn’t run them down to try to bring them back. <em>Why</em> <em>didn’t he</em>?<sup>4</sup></li>
<li>He was chained by the Romans, spat on, crowned with thorns, and whipped. But instead of showing them signs and wonders He let them abuse Him. Then He forgave them after they nailed Him to the cross multiple times and speared Him in His side and gave Him vinegar to drink (Psalm 69, John 19).</li>
<li>He knew He couldn’t convince them. He once healed a withered man’s hands and the Pharisees wanted to destroy Him because he did so on the sabbath (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/12?id=p10-p15&amp;lang=eng#p10">Matthew 12:9-14</a>)<sup>5</sup>. How too are we like the Pharisees where we say “God shouldn’t be like X!!!” Shouldn’t we instead let God reveal Himself?</li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Consider this in a humorous way: Why didn’t He say “oh sorry!! Please come back! I’ve got a quota of disciples to reach and if I don’t have you with me…””</p></li><li id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I love how instead of engaging with the Pharisees, He “withdrew” from them and “healed them all”, kind of as a divine rebel just saying, “you’re mad about me healing one guy on the Sabbath? Fine, I’ll heal everyone.”</p></li></div><p>These three clues, among many others, give me perspective on why He’s okay being misunderstood by us.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-god-of-purpose-children-of-purpose-and-promise" class="level1">
<h1>A God of purpose, children of purpose and promise</h1>
<p>Why does He want us to live by faith? Lots of reasons. But there’s only one I’ll speak to: He’s a God of purpose:</p>

<p>37 And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. 38 And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words. 39 For behold, ==this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man==. - <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?id=p37-p39&amp;lang=eng#p37">Moses 1:37-39</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His goal is to prepare an environment to teach and challenge us. Our goal should be to learn who, how and why.</p>
<p>Our purpose should not be to put God in a box or imagine Him black and white. It should be to learn who He is, so He’a no longer an unknown God.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. - <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17?id=p3&amp;lang=eng#p3">John 17:3</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>Post Christmas blues? Remember the empty tombs</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/christmas-empty-tomb.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="an-empty-spot-in-the-room" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>An empty spot in the room</h1>
<p>Just cleaned up the Christmas tree and all its ornaments and needles. The glittering, shimmering, and sparkling lights that have warmed us for the last month are officially gone. Packed up. Shipped out. Sent home.</p>
<p>My child remarked, “it feels so empty without the tree!” I couldn’t help but agree.</p>
<p>The thought dawned on me, perhaps this is what the disciples felt once His light left the earth. Some accounts declare there was thundering and lightning and three days of darkness that covered the earth after He gave His life.</p>

</section>
<section id="an-empty-room-an-empty-tomb" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>An empty room, an empty tomb</h1>
<p>But just as His easily preventable departure left friends and parents weeping (because they didn’t fully understand what He was dying for, (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16?id=p21-p23&amp;lang=eng#p21">Matthew 16:21-23</a>), perhaps we can remember a little of that sadness that they felt as we clean up the tree. The child was born. He was born to break the bonds of death. He died, some describing He died on a tree. And now, my pine tree representing Christ(mas) is also dead.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. (1 Peter 2:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it’s also symbolic we cut down the tree to put it in our homes. It has an expiration date, just like Christ’s life. He knew it was time (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?id=p26-p27&amp;lang=eng#p26">John 13:26-27</a>), even if nobody else could comprehend.</p>
<p>But remember what happened after? He resurrected. He brought His light back to His friends.</p>
<p>Perhaps New Year’s lights can remind us of His return. And perhaps a New Year’s resolution can remind us that He invited His disciples to change their ways and go and preach to the gentiles (people previously not allowed to have His gospel and His gift of baptism and the Holy Ghost), to share the gift of Christ(mas) with everyone.</p>
<p>The death of Christ marked the fulfillment of prophecy and the fulfillment of the Law of Moses, which meant that the Jews and the house of Israel were no longer the only ones chosen by God but now everybody could receive the gospel (Galatians 3:29).</p>
<p>Let’s take this new year to remember all are loved. All are remembered. All are invited to happiness and peace through Christ.</p>

  <title>His is the light that we should share</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/let-your-light-so-shine.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When Christ was teaching his disciples, he invited them to share their light to the world. But then he elaborated in an interesting way:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?id=p24&amp;lang=eng#p24">3rd Nephi 18:24</a> Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up—that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord is their light. He is our light. He is the light we hold up to the world and let shine. He is our light that we let shine.</p>
<p>The pronouns here are impactful by their implication:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He assumes we have light</li>
<li>He assumes we have Him as our light</li>
<li>He invites us to share the light we possess</li>
<li>The light we possess is His light</li>
<li>But it is ours. And it is his. Our light is His light. His light is our light.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works…”. Read in this new way: obtain the Lord as your light. Then shine His light before men.</p>

  <title>The Christ Child</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/the-christ-child.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The story of the Savior’s birth brings many wonderful concepts to memory and can teach us a lot about what will bring us true joy and happiness in this life.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">The Christ Child</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is my favorite video of the Christmas story. The most powerful part is the moment when Mary sings a lullaby to Jesus. I remember reading somewhere that this moment was completely impromptu by the actress, and it speaks volumes to the sacredness of the moment where Mary first laid eyes on her beloved son.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXWoKi5x3lw?si=JogPuTvWW1X-aD-S" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>So what does this story give me perspective on at this time of year?</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ was the rightful, bloodline heir to King David’s throne. He was the King of the Jews. But he never sought authority. He never sought a throne. He instead taught <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22?id=p17-p21&amp;lang=eng#p17">“Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s”</a>. He didn’t engage in turf battles. In rebellion. In insurrection. He just wanted people to find happiness in their circumstances by living with lovingkindness in their hearts for their God, their neighbor, and themselves.</li>
<li>In his role as a Savior and Judge of the world, he sought to not condemn the sinner trapped in the act of sin. Instead he came to liberate. To forgive. To support.</li>
<li>If you believe Christ was the Creator and Savior of the world, consider how He chose to come into the world. He was born in a stable, mucked with animal feces and rotting food scraps, covered with the stench of…a stable. He was rejected of a room in the inn. He was laid in a manger, perhaps a feeding trough. Maybe Mary had help giving birth, maybe she didn’t. He was born generally alone. I wonder if He chose to do his birth this way because nobody can say he had it easy. He didn’t have the special treatment of a King’s birth. No, he was born to an exhausted, weary traveler, likely on the cold hard floor of a dirty barn.</li>
<li>If we think about the Savior being the architect of this birth, think about how he planned for angels to show up to shepherds. Not King Herod. The shepherds. He would be the prophesied sacrificial Lamb. He would be the Good Shepherd. Yet these people were perhaps the minimum wage, forgotten ones outside the city gate. Yet these are those who had the privilege to see Him first. And He invited them to come and see. His whole life was an invitation.</li>
<li>He also invited the rich wise men. All are invited. He wanted all to see, and he wanted the world to know that He was for everyone regardless their circumstances. And that all of us, whether destitute or traveling with caravans, can bring the gifts of our heart to Him. We don’t need to bring gold. He just wants a <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?id=p20&amp;lang=eng#p20">“broken heart and contrite spirit.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>How can we apply these things to our life, today?</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek out the forgotten. The people in our life that seem forgotten. The servants in our life (person on the other end of the customer support line, the checkout person, your supervisor) but even, your <a href="https://youtu.be/tX8TgVR33KM?si=Jdwq-B9W0dhWYhLA">best friend who seems to be doing great…</a></li>
<li>Seek not riches or wealth. Harod sought these things. Christ sought relationships and truth.</li>
<li>Don’t seek for power. Christ deserved it. Christ had it. He turned water to wine, cursed a tree, and made a host of <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/18?id=p4-p6&amp;lang=eng#p4">men fall over at the sound of his voice</a>. Yet he didn’t touch the Romans.</li>
<li>Seek to invite. To share. To uplift. Christ made shepherds feel important. He invited them to his crib side. And ” his hand is stretched out still.” (Isaiah 9:12)</li>
</ul>
<p>He came like all of us, as a child. But he came to show us how a God would live. And he did.</p>

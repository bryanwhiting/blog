<p>2024-01-21 - “Attend to it” - Joseph Senior supported Joseph. The Angel wanted Joseph to know this. - David’s field being ploughed overnight - a few items were left for David - the Lord did just enough. Also, the Lord honored the man’s request and didn’t disrespect him. The man got what he wanted, David did some more work, and the unnecessary part was finished by whomever. - Joseph’s trouble was being heavily persecuted physically. Like the Israelites. Now, physical persecution has mostly stopped and instead it’s just verbal assaults at “the church” from press and random voices on social media. The challenge of our day is to remain faithful.</p>

<p>2024-01-22 - father poem. Father forgets. - bate the hook to please the fish - Tell them what they want - And how to get it - Lavish with praise. This is greater incentive than any criticism - What do they want? (Not what do I want?) “smoking will keep you from making the bball team” - Ford: put yourself in their position. Consider it. And consider your own - Consider how they’ll receive your email. They have a ton of problems. They’re overwhelmed. Don’t sell them. Teach them the benefits they’ll get. - Flattery vs appreciation - flattery is lip service. If you’re trying to convince someone to do something and you’re using flattery, then thats manipulation. And you’re prone to get angry if they don’t want to do it (kids). But if you’re sincere, you’ll find a solution - Arouse in others an eager want - Don’t tell someone an idea. Plant the seed and make them think it’s their own.</p>
<p>2024-01-20 - 85% of success is in non-technical skills. Communication. - We grow far faster by rewarding good behavior than punishing bad behavior - Kids. - Futility of criticism - Ask questions. “Does your hard hat not fit properly? It will save you.” - Don’t kick a beehive if you want honey - “I don’t see how I could have done any better” - Criticism - Abraham Lincoln never sent the letter -</p>

<p>I was reading the wrong book. I read <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> when my friends recommended <em>this</em> one instead.</p>
<p>I already like this one better. It lays things out better i feel. More chronological. But perhaps it’s because he has more time to write it.</p>

<li>creativity is grounded, not whimsical, thinking. Even scientists would agree as they become creative in the process of making new discoveries.

<p>Takeaway - their creative ideas took decades to form. Or went years without being published. - Surround yourself with people who challenge you - They created a new syllabus. - power is to those who hold it. Everyone else adapts.</p>
<p>Blog ideas: - don’t mistake challenge with truth. Someone who is on mistrurh side can convince you</p>

<li>coool ending. The blind guy sees out of his kids eyes.</li>
<li>Refuses Chaney reincarnation.</li>
<li>Duncan Idaho returns.</li>
<li>Twins: Star Wars copies. And padme. And all that.</li>
<li>More political than the first. Focusing on the torment of a leader who has it all. What must it be like to have everything? The thought experiment is worth the read.</li>
<li>People try to kill him. Want his blood. His children. But he can’t have his wife, and sacrifices her and himself for the Dunes. May he enjoy his rest.</li>

<p>Notes: - socrates had a voice he felt was from Gods. Daimonion - Memorization. Lots of it. - Humanism - treated sacrifices to the gods as transactional. This meant they relied on themselves rather than gods to teach them. - Odd relationships (pedophelia) - function: intended purpose. Virtue: quality of function.</p>

  <title>How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</title>

</figure>
</div>
<p>What is my best decision? Worst?</p>
<ul>
<li>resulting: focusing on outcomes, rather than expected values and doing the best</li>
<li>to improve decision making: focus on what the process was for decision making. Information gathering. Question asking.</li>
<li>Remember choosing to leave Novi, wondering if someone was going to be a millionaire in my absence. Couldn’t help but feel I was leaving money on the table by leaving. But I decided to leave to pursue what I was passionate about, and regardless that Novi went under I felt that was the right call as I finished my masters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions: - make a knowledge tracker. Details on decisions. Info known before/after. Make this going forward</p>
<p>Decision process: - where do you want to go? - What are all the ways to get there? - By taking X choice, what are other ways it could go? What’s the probability?</p>

<p>Love the storytelling. Herbert has a way of revealing things he narrates, observations, but holds the conclusions and insights to the individuals.</p>
<p>Makes you feel like you have superpowers as you read it. Am I a Fremen? An Atreities? It’s fun to read and consider.</p>
<p>Thought provoking. Concepts of politics, religion, science, and diplomacy. War, worms, and wonder. Great read.</p>

<ul>
<li>shield your son too much and he’ll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny</li>
<li>deprogram after the machines. Let the machines do too much thinking.</li>
<li>humans must never submit to animals</li>
<li>“how did the woman seal my tongue?” Paul can’t tell his father he’s going to die. Why? Sometimes our tongues are bound to speak that which can’t be changed</li>
<li>“the mind commands the body and it obeys. It commands itself and it rebels”</li>
</ul>
<p>Connections: - Alan Pinkerton <a href="../killers-of-the-flower-moonyfg if.md">killers</a> “secrets break the character of the criminal till they give it out”. Dr Yueh cries when his scripture is given out.</p>
<p>Notes: - if I made him do it it wouldn’t be his doing. - storytelling: why tell us 100% of everything up front? The movie hides the secrets about Yueh. - storytelling: the hindsight narrator</p>
<p>When God has appointed a man to die, he guides his wants to desire that place</p>
<ul>
<li>you’re remembered for what you fear</li>
<li>Focusing too much on sight dulls the other senses</li>
<li>We became weak on caladan</li>
<li>Why beat yourself up after an emotional experience? What does it take to relevel yiur head.</li>
<li>“Their minds rejected what they could not comprehend or encompass”</li>
<li>Taking and giving force. a man loves the taking force, but he can’t get into the giving force without being changed.</li>
<li>Power changed Muaddib to not care about lost people. Why is that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Storytelling - How he explains their thoughts after subtle observations. He explains things through humanity, not through narration alone. This makes those points more salient. It’s as if the dialogue is the content and the narration are the footnotes and context.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stilgar becoming a worshipper.</li>
<li>Having lived billions upon billions of lives. Known cruelty.</li>
<li>Trying to prevent the jihad, does he inevitably create it?</li>
</ul>

  <title>Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI</title>

TL;DR

</div>

<ul>
<li>Hale: self made man. Cowboy. Learned the trade. Got one cow. Then many. Then had 25,000 acres.</li>
<li>Ally. Used his position as a white guy to advocate on behalf of the Osage.<br>
</li>
<li>Cherokee nation parceled and “first come first serve” over 42,000 acres. Brawl.</li>
<li>“my people will only be happy once the money is gone”</li>
<li>Wild West: private eye 1921 &gt; than local sheriff</li>
<li>1850 Alan Pinkerton - private eye.</li>
<li>guardians - Osage couldn’t spend their own money without approval</li>
<li>criminal’s secret eats away at him</li>
<li>judicial execution is a challenge of taming the evils within even those on the “right side of the law” calling for justice. Do we really need to execute someone? What if they’re actually innocent?</li>
</ul>
<p>Earnest Burkheart’s confession: - similar to <a href="../the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.md">The Tell Tale heart</a>. Someone feels better letting go of lying and coming clean. He was a happy man, even living in prison the rest of his life. - Why doesn’t Hale feel this way?</p>
<p>They were the happiest people because they didn’t own anything and nobody owned them.</p>
<p>Storytelling: - Zoom out of the big picture, get to some conclusion of Earnest’s story, then get back to the main plot. Wrap up the branches, perhaps with some summary or quip. - focused on one storyline, but revealed other side stories and off shoots. - the mystery is in the known details, unknown at the tkme</p>
<p>Takeaways: - Different types of people. Earnest - has somewhat of a conscience to tell the truth. - FBI agents died destitute. No glory. Hoover took it all</p>
<p>Tom White is incredible. Was shot and left for dead but forgave his captors.</p>
<p>Questions: - how many descendants today with money stolen from the Osage? - how many crimes like this continue to happen today?</p>

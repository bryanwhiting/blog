<p>Notes: - socrates had a voice he felt was from Gods. Daimonion - Memorization. Lots of it. - Humanism - treated sacrifices to the gods as transactional. This meant they relied on themselves rather than gods to teach them. - Odd relationships (pedophelia) - function: intended purpose. Virtue: quality of function.</p>

  <title>How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</title>

</figure>
</div>
<p>What is my best decision? Worst?</p>
<ul>
<li>resulting: focusing on outcomes, rather than expected values and doing the best</li>
<li>to improve decision making: focus on what the process was for decision making. Information gathering. Question asking.</li>
<li>Remember choosing to leave Novi, wondering if someone was going to be a millionaire in my absence. Couldn’t help but feel I was leaving money on the table by leaving. But I decided to leave to pursue what I was passionate about, and regardless that Novi went under I felt that was the right call as I finished my masters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions: - make a knowledge tracker. Details on decisions. Info known before/after. Make this going forward</p>
<p>Decision process: - where do you want to go? - What are all the ways to get there? - By taking X choice, what are other ways it could go? What’s the probability?</p>

  <title>Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI</title>

<ul>
<li>Hale: self made man. Cowboy. Learned the trade. Got one cow. Then many. Then had 25,000 acres.</li>
<li>Ally. Used his position as a white guy to advocate on behalf of the Osage.<br>
</li>
<li>Cherokee nation parceled and “first come first serve” over 42,000 acres. Brawl.</li>
<li>“my people will only be happy once the money is gone”</li>
<li>Wild West: private eye 1921 &gt; than local sheriff</li>
<li>1850 Alan Pinkerton - private eye.</li>
<li>guardians - Osage couldn’t spend their own money without approval</li>
<li>criminal’s secret eats away at him</li>
<li>judicial execution is a challenge of taming the evils within even those on the “right side of the law” calling for justice. Do we really need to execute someone? What if they’re actually innocent?</li>
</ul>
<p>Earnest Burkheart’s confession: - similar to <a href="../the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.md">The Tell Tale heart</a>. Someone feels better letting go of lying and coming clean. He was a happy man, even living in prison the rest of his life. - Why doesn’t Hale feel this way?</p>
<p>They were the happiest people because they didn’t own anything and nobody owned them.</p>
<p>Storytelling: - Zoom out of the big picture, get to some conclusion of Earnest’s story, then get back to the main plot. Wrap up the branches, perhaps with some summary or quip. - focused on one storyline, but revealed other side stories and off shoots. - the mystery is in the known details, unknown at the tkme</p>
<p>Takeaways: - Different types of people. Earnest - has somewhat of a conscience to tell the truth. - FBI agents died destitute. No glory. Hoover took it all</p>
<p>Tom White is incredible. Was shot and left for dead but forgave his captors.</p>
<p>Questions: - how many descendants today with money stolen from the Osage? - how many crimes like this continue to happen today?</p>

<p>Scientists are hampered by the peer review process. The notion that some tolerate the process so they can get their grants approved and get tenure, and others eventually accept the process because that’s how they got tenure, is a sad outcome of human incentives.</p>
<p>Interestingly, inventions have always happened regardless of peer review. Edison didn’t need someone to review his invention to tell him whether or not it’s a valid invention. Either the light bulb illuminates or it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Yet that’s exactly how things go now. So what’s the result?</p>
<p>People write to please the peer reviewer. Social conformity. Group think.</p>
<p>People are incentivized to game the system: write a grant that gets them funding so they can get tenure and support their families.</p>
<p>The incentive to be innovative is small, though intellectual curiosity powers through for some. The incentive to stay in line and do what’s necessary to get approved is strong.</p>
<p>We’ve also learned as a consequence of 2020-2022 that a lot of scientists can indeed be wrong. Today science is becoming less about discovering truth and more about people owning their truth…people love their politics.</p>
<p>What makes a scientist anyway? Am I a scientist because I’m a data scientist? Because I studied statistics? I’ve never published an academic article in a journal, so is that the threshold?</p>
<p>I think someone who pursues truth through repeatable experimentation is a scientist. Back in Plato’s day they were just called philosophers.</p>
</section>
<section id="todays-incentives" class="level1">
<h1>Today’s Incentives</h1>
<p>There’s a reason really smart people now work at Apple to invent the iPhone, Facebook to work on LLMs, and SpaceX to build rockets. The freedom they feel at these companies is empowering. Per “Scientific Freedom”, if the trends continue then people like Max Plank would never have been able to get the funding needed to invent what he did. Where’s the money? Social media. Advertising. And now, AI.</p>
<p>People will always be inventive. But it’s by removing the social barriers that they become so.</p>

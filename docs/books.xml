<p>I was reading the wrong book. I read <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> when my friends recommended <em>this</em> one instead.</p>
<p>I already like this one better. It lays things out better i feel. More chronological. But perhaps it’s because he has more time to write it.</p>

<p>Knowing CS was in the war and had some relationship with Moore is fascinating.</p>

<li>Satan delights in giving war, regardless if he can’t win.</li>
<li>Satan delights in having raised war, feeling he is proud and strong for resisting good. Being courageous to walk out. But his courage only warranted misery.</li>
<li>“The mind is powerful. Can make heaven of hell or hell of heaven.”</li>
<li>Why would Satan want to walk away, knowing he was giving up godhood? What motivated him more than happiness?</li>

</div>
<p>2024-01-16 - critique. Harsh critique. Safe space. - Get together. Review. Discuss ideas. Listen. - Freely gathered friends. Not assigned. Friends. This was important. Innovation. - Creating worlds is hard. So Tolkien told many stories within the lotr world. Same with Lewis and</p>
<p>2024-01-10</p>
<ul>
<li>long walks. Lewis would walk with Tolkien. Tolkien then wrote about a super long walk in the hobit and lotr</li>
<li>Language is the invention of objevts or ideas. Myth is the invention about truth. #post-ideas. Get this quote
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-01-09 Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tolkien build one language and derived it for two elvish languages.
<ul>
<li>Saw beauty in languages</li>
<li>Word at Oxford dictionary</li>
<li>Places like the shire were inspired by his experiences</li>
<li>Orcs represent machinists and wizards the old world.</li>
<li>Fellowship: his friends died in the war. The Tea Club. TCBS.</li>
<li>My grandma had the “double S” club.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>“Well read” - makes you more of what you already are?</p>
<p>Lewis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dymer: narrative poem
<ul>
<li>Plato’s republic</li>
<li>Dante.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>friendship is to disagree. To argue the other side just</li>
</ul>
<p>owen Barfield</p>
<ul>
<li>anyhroposophical</li>
<li>Evolution of consciousness
<ul>
<li>creativity is grounded, not whimsical, thinking. Even scientists would agree as they become creative in the process of making new discoveries. If you need a creative mind to get to a new way of thinking (new theory that becomes truth), isn’t the creative thinking truth itself? (Or rather it’s not just whimsical).</li>
<li>Imaginative thinking is crucial for both artistic creation and scientific discovery
<ul>
<li><a href="http://owenbarfield.org/BARFIELD/encyclopedia_barfieldiana/Ideas_Concepts/Science.html">Owenbarfield blog</a></li>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Takeaway - their creative ideas took decades to form. Or went years without being published. - Surround yourself with people who challenge you - They created a new syllabus. - power is to those who hold it. Everyone else adapts.</p>
<p>Blog ideas: - don’t mistake challenge with truth. Someone who is on mistrurh side can convince you</p>

<li>More political than the first. Focusing on the torment of a leader who has it all. What must it be like to have everything? The thought experiment is worth the read.</li>

<p>Notes: - socrates had a voice he felt was from Gods. Daimonion - Memorization. Lots of it. - Humanism - treated sacrifices to the gods as transactional. This meant they relied on themselves rather than gods to teach them. - Odd relationships (pedophelia) - function: intended purpose. Virtue: quality of function.</p>

</div>
<p>What is my best decision? Worst?</p>
<ul>
<li>resulting: focusing on outcomes, rather than expected values and doing the best</li>
<li>to improve decision making: focus on what the process was for decision making. Information gathering. Question asking.</li>
<li>Remember choosing to leave Novi, wondering if someone was going to be a millionaire in my absence. Couldn’t help but feel I was leaving money on the table by leaving. But I decided to leave to pursue what I was passionate about, and regardless that Novi went under I felt that was the right call as I finished my masters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions: - make a knowledge tracker. Details on decisions. Info known before/after. Make this going forward</p>
<p>Decision process: - where do you want to go? - What are all the ways to get there? - By taking X choice, what are other ways it could go? What’s the probability?</p>

<p>Love the storytelling. Herbert has a way of revealing things he narrates, observations, but holds the conclusions and insights to the individuals.</p>
<p>Makes you feel like you have superpowers as you read it. Am I a Fremen? An Atreities? It’s fun to read and consider.</p>
<p>Thought provoking. Concepts of politics, religion, science, and diplomacy. War, worms, and wonder. Great read.</p>

<ul>
<li>shield your son too much and he’ll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny</li>
<li>deprogram after the machines. Let the machines do too much thinking.</li>
<li>humans must never submit to animals</li>
<li>“how did the woman seal my tongue?” Paul can’t tell his father he’s going to die. Why? Sometimes our tongues are bound to speak that which can’t be changed</li>
<li>“the mind commands the body and it obeys. It commands itself and it rebels”</li>
</ul>
<p>Connections: - Alan Pinkerton <a href="../killers-of-the-flower-moonyfg if.md">killers</a> “secrets break the character of the criminal till they give it out”. Dr Yueh cries when his scripture is given out.</p>
<p>Notes: - if I made him do it it wouldn’t be his doing. - storytelling: why tell us 100% of everything up front? The movie hides the secrets about Yueh. - storytelling: the hindsight narrator</p>
<p>When God has appointed a man to die, he guides his wants to desire that place</p>
<ul>
<li>you’re remembered for what you fear</li>
<li>Focusing too much on sight dulls the other senses</li>
<li>We became weak on caladan</li>
<li>Why beat yourself up after an emotional experience? What does it take to relevel yiur head.</li>
<li>“Their minds rejected what they could not comprehend or encompass”</li>
<li>Taking and giving force. a man loves the taking force, but he can’t get into the giving force without being changed.</li>
<li>Power changed Muaddib to not care about lost people. Why is that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Storytelling - How he explains their thoughts after subtle observations. He explains things through humanity, not through narration alone. This makes those points more salient. It’s as if the dialogue is the content and the narration are the footnotes and context.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stilgar becoming a worshipper.</li>
<li>Having lived billions upon billions of lives. Known cruelty.</li>
<li>Trying to prevent the jihad, does he inevitably create it?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Hale: self made man. Cowboy. Learned the trade. Got one cow. Then many. Then had 25,000 acres.</li>
<li>Ally. Used his position as a white guy to advocate on behalf of the Osage.<br>
</li>
<li>Cherokee nation parceled and “first come first serve” over 42,000 acres. Brawl.</li>
<li>“my people will only be happy once the money is gone”</li>
<li>Wild West: private eye 1921 &gt; than local sheriff</li>
<li>1850 Alan Pinkerton - private eye.</li>
<li>guardians - Osage couldn’t spend their own money without approval</li>
<li>criminal’s secret eats away at him</li>
<li>judicial execution is a challenge of taming the evils within even those on the “right side of the law” calling for justice. Do we really need to execute someone? What if they’re actually innocent?</li>
</ul>
<p>Earnest Burkheart’s confession: - similar to <a href="../the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.md">The Tell Tale heart</a>. Someone feels better letting go of lying and coming clean. He was a happy man, even living in prison the rest of his life. - Why doesn’t Hale feel this way?</p>
<p>They were the happiest people because they didn’t own anything and nobody owned them.</p>
<p>Storytelling: - Zoom out of the big picture, get to some conclusion of Earnest’s story, then get back to the main plot. Wrap up the branches, perhaps with some summary or quip. - focused on one storyline, but revealed other side stories and off shoots. - the mystery is in the known details, unknown at the tkme</p>
<p>Takeaways: - Different types of people. Earnest - has somewhat of a conscience to tell the truth. - FBI agents died destitute. No glory. Hoover took it all</p>
<p>Tom White is incredible. Was shot and left for dead but forgave his captors.</p>
<p>Questions: - how many descendants today with money stolen from the Osage? - how many crimes like this continue to happen today?</p>

<p>This is a classic. First time reading it and I love it.</p>
<p>What I love about the storytelling:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Declare something as unavoidably true, even if ridiculous, and build all content off of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nobody cares that the infinity probability drive is absurdly improbable. But once the reader just accepts this as fact the rest of the story make sense.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>get into the mind of the reader</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>sperm whale? I love when he’s detailing the whales first and last thoughts. Just so random, but hilarious.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>be spontaneous, but connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I recently watched the second season of Loki and couldn’t stand it. It was all over the place. Random here, random there. But this is great because the spontaneity flows within the confines of the story.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>logic, with social proof, can invert the mind</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arthur dent is flabbergasted by mice being the most intelligent species. Well the logic is sound: they were just fooling us and running experiments on us the whole time so we wouldn’t think anything of it. This flip on expectation, backed by “isn’t it obvious?!” gets the reader wondering for a second before they snap back to reality: no, mice aren’t running the universe.</li>

TL;DR: A scientist isn’t a title, but a philosophy
</div>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">

</div>
</div>
<p>Scientists are hampered by the peer review process. The notion that some tolerate the process so they can get their grants approved and get tenure, and others eventually accept the process because that’s how they got tenure, is a sad outcome of human incentives.</p>
<p>Interestingly, inventions have always happened regardless of peer review. Edison didn’t need someone to review his invention to tell him whether or not it’s a valid invention. Either the light bulb illuminates or it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Yet that’s exactly how things go now. So what’s the result?</p>
<p>People write to please the peer reviewer. Social conformity. Group think.</p>
<p>People are incentivized to game the system: write a grant that gets them funding so they can get tenure and support their families.</p>
<p>The incentive to be innovative is small, though intellectual curiosity powers through for some. The incentive to stay in line and do what’s necessary to get approved is strong.</p>
<p>We’ve also learned as a consequence of 2020-2022 that a lot of scientists can indeed be wrong. Today science is becoming less about discovering truth and more about people owning their truth…people love their politics.</p>
<p>What makes a scientist anyway? Am I a scientist because I’m a data scientist? Because I studied statistics? I’ve never published an academic article in a journal, so is that the threshold?</p>
<p>I think someone who pursues truth through repeatable experimentation is a scientist. Back in Plato’s day they were just called philosophers.</p>
</section>
<section id="todays-incentives" class="level1">
<h1>Today’s Incentives</h1>
<p>There’s a reason really smart people now work at Apple to invent the iPhone, Facebook to work on LLMs, and SpaceX to build rockets. The freedom they feel at these companies is empowering. Per “Scientific Freedom”, if the trends continue then people like Max Plank would never have been able to get the funding needed to invent what he did. Where’s the money? Social media. Advertising. And now, AI.</p>
<p>People will always be inventive. But it’s by removing the social barriers that they become so.</p>

  <title>Getting Things Done</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/getting-things-done.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/book-gtd.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<section id="principles-and-core-insights" class="level1">
<h1>Principles and Core Insights</h1>
<p>After 21% my takeaways are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“My mind is weighed down by all of the ideas of things I can do.” I waste my time on todos that are just “go to doctor”, but should be “schedule appointment to go to doctor”. Anything that only takes 2 min should be done immediately. Anything longer later. But I love that clarity - I’ve often written lots of todos but not from the “next action to take” perspective.</li>
<li>“Visions can be built from the ground up rather than just top down.” I’ve tried writing down big visions for my 10 year future and it never works for me. I’ve got anxiety when I try to think where I want to be in 10 years. I mean, I know I want to be happy, be best friends with my wife and kids and have meaningful relationships but whether I’m still a data scientist or a farmer by then is anyones guess. (I wanna keep my options open.) But as I look at the things on my todo list and “eventual” to do list, a different picture emerges. I know I want to be a writer (hence this blog), I know I want to travel to XYZ location, to be involved in giving back, etc. TLDR: I know things I want to experience in life. I don’t have to craft value statements and invent ideas of what to do (seems forced). Instead I can reflect on what’s currently exciting and important to me and categorize those things into high levels values/missions. This will help me when I need to prioritize so not every whim of an idea gets my attention.</li>
<li>GTD book just lays out what a todo is. It breaks down the problem of doing things (big and small) into what they are (time sensitive, someday, etc). Whether I’ll follow the system is up for debate, but I love the ideas so far. It very much fits my naturally organized mind, but may not work for more spontaneous folks that don’t like as much structure and list keeping.</li>
<li>Most of my “todos” have been “intended outcomes”, but not “next actions”. For example, I see I have “change car battery” on my list right now and “plan yosemite trip”. But these aren’t todos. I can’t organize and prioritize outcomes. I can only organize and prioritize actions, he says. Changing these to “call mechanic to book oil and battery change and identify an hour in your calendar”. And “open recreation.gov when walking around the house and find a campsite.”</li>
<li>Organize tasks around where you’ll do them. This is in line with Atomic habits which states to be hyper specific about where and when you’ll do something. “Call grandma when I get into my car tomorrow morning to go to work.” Or “take a moment at my desk during lunchtime to find a mechanic by opening Google Maps and plan an oil change. Find 1 open hour on the calendar.”</li>
</ol>

<h1>Putting it into practice</h1>
<p>I’ve been using TickTick for my task manager, which has Lists (folders) where I can put my tasks and tags so I can label and categorize each task. Here’s my organization strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>When jotting ideas write intended outcome and next action as my todo.</li>
<li>Tag with where I’ll do it and provide day or time it’s due (if applicable)<br>
</li>
<li>Move each item to a respective list:
<ul>
<li>ASAP - there’s a useful urgency to this task (begin memo)</li>
<li>Eventually - there’s no urgency but I know I’ll want to do this</li>
<li>Someday maybe - no urgency and no commitment, but it’s an idea of something I want to do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tagging system: tag each item with either Work or Personal. Then within that, some meaningful themes:
<ul>
<li>ProjectName (work deliverable or personal project like “ImproveMyHealth”, “BuildApp”)<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Location (where I’ll do it). Around the house. At desk. In car. While cleaning the house, etc. this is habit stacking. Most work stuff is done at my desk.</li>
<li>when I’ll do it. Stack with other activities. Examples: Before lunch.</li>
<li>Duration (how long it takes: 1, 2, 4 hours, 5, 30min). This might be useful for planning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>List system. Move from inbox to list when properly categorized. I like “Work” and “Personal” lists. I think since you can use unlimited tags, and tags can be nested in TickTick, there’s no substantive differ ne between list and tag. Not sure yet how to use the TickTick lists when tags are so useful. Lists of work and personal.</li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Deciding Vision</strong>: As I write this, choosing a project might be a good place to insert a goal (intended outcome) as a project name. Instead of Exercise, the intended outcome is improving health. The goal is being able to run a 5k. So perhaps goal/objective is “ImproveHealth” and KR is “run 5k”. These goals can be identified by asking the 5 whys. If I have an idea if “go running” as my task, a good grounds-up vision exercise would be to ask “why do I want to run a mile tomorrow? Is it to accomplish something or to relax my mind? Why is relaxing my mind important to me? Why is my mental health important? Etc. I think subconsciously ideas come of what to do next all the time “I should work out” but rarely do I take the time to ask “why do I see the need to work out? What’s the greater vision here for this task?” Understanding that vision can help prioritize and build a desire to accomplish the task. If the idea “learn a new language” comes up, asking why can help me realize “oh, this is just for fun and won’t be for anything meatier than having fun! No pressure on this task and maybe I’ll never do it.” The nag to run a mile might help me realize “I need to take care of my health, and this can’t wait.”</p></li></div><p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea/task comes.</li>
<li>Document in inbox.</li>
<li>Clarify the intended outcome and the next action.</li>
<li>Organize: tag. Set up reminder. Move out of inbox to list.</li>
<li>Review and Prioritize: understand where these ideas will take you and choose your adventure.</li>
<li>Do!</li>
</ul>

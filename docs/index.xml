  <title>Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/turn-to-god-not-your-idols.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I wrote <a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a> in the mindset of having intentional prayers. Today, I experienced another one.</p>
<section id="a-typical-day" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>A Typical Day</h1>
<p>I felt overwhelmed by a few things (just day to day life, parenting, working, making sure I get that insurance policy and that bill figured out, etc, etc, etc.)</p>
<p>I decided to see if prayer could help me get out of my funk.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-angels-in-the-crop-fields.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Pray for help in all things, and watch the Hand of the Lord reveal itself</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>During my prayer, I felt something happen. I decided I would pray until I felt a change. And I did. I felt a change. More hope entered in. (“It’s all gonna be fine!”) I felt more grateful for the help I failed to fully appreciate just moments ago.</p>
<p>We get into moods. And bad moods are hard to get out of. But this is life. Life is full of bad moods.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-do-you-do-to-fix-your-bad-mood" class="level1">
<h1>What do you do to fix your bad mood?</h1>
<p>This quote came to mind while I was praying:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As you think celestial, you will find yourself avoiding anything that robs you of your agency. Any addiction—be it gaming, gambling, debt, drugs, alcohol, anger, pornography, sex, or even food﻿—offends God. Why? <strong>Because your obsession becomes your god. You look to it rather than to Him for solace.</strong><br>
<a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-think-celestial">“Think Celestial!”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t need an addiction to appreciate the sentiment here: where do you turn when you’re struggling?</p>
<p>Do you turn to social media? Phone calls? News? The internet? TV? Anger? Food?</p>
<p>I’ve tried all those things. They’re all wonderful (except anger lol), especially calling a friend. But am I doing that before taking the issue to the Lord?</p>
<p>He has invited us to take all things to Him. Every thought even:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Look unto me in <strong><em>every</em></strong> thought; doubt not, fear not.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-6.36">Doctrine and Covenants 6.36</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we take all things to Him so He can consecrate them to us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ye must <strong>not perform any thing</strong> unto the Lord <strong>save in the first place ye shall pray</strong> unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9">2 Nephi 32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Lord blesses us even when we don’t pray. But the promise is in the prayer: pray in all things. Pray in every thought. Do all things for Good reasons.</p>
<p>And he didn’t qualify what “labor” means here:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Come unto me, <strong>all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</strong> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30">Matthew 11.28–30</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps He wants us to decide what our labor is, bring it to Him, and consecrate it and ask His help. This seems aligned with Him wanting us to be agents:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.28">Doctrine and Covenants 58.28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This comes after “Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;” <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.27">Doctrine and Covenants 58.27</a>)</p>
</section>
<section id="let-god-prevail" class="level1">
<h1>Let God Prevail</h1>
<p>So: get an idea of some good cause to be engaged in (parenting, providing for family, etc), pray for support in it, ask Him to consecrate it, watch for miracles.</p>
<p>I think we find reasons for why we <em>shouldn’t</em> pray.<sup>1</sup> Because we think we need to do it on our own. There’s a constant balance between “how much do I rely on God and how much should I just get up and do it myself”. I think the balance is rather not a balance at all. Just pick a plan, ask for help, then go and do what’s in your power. The scriptures are full of examples of people who did this.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>He loves us. He wants us to succeed. He cares about our daily labor, whether that’s in a field or in the barn that a home turns into. If you’re still wondering, <a href="https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/the-simple-miracle-that-helped-the-whitmers-further-the-book-of-mormon">Read this cool story on David Whitmer and how the Lord helped him with his crops</a> and how the Lord is aware of all our needs, temporal and spiritual.</p>
<p>I got up from my prayer feeling “I can do this!” And the impression came “<em>we</em> can do this”.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 11 - Angel shows signs to Nephi</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-11-seeing-signs-of-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Nephi saw a vision because he desired knowledge. Consider the Angel’s instruction:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>7 And behold this thing <strong>shall be given unto thee for a sign</strong>, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-11.7">1 Nephi 11.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we know that the Lord rebuked the Pharisees for seeking signs:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but <strong>can ye not discern the signs of the times?</strong> A <strong>wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign</strong>; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. <a href="../scriptures/matthew-16.1-4">Matthew 16.1–4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But signs themselves are good. Moses lead by signs: the seven miracles. Baal was trumped by a sign: fire from heaven. Manna in the wilderness. Water from the rock. The fall of the city from trumpets. Oil in the vial.</p>
<p>Any miracle is a sign. A sign that God exists. That He has all power. That Christ is His son.</p>
<p>But today we don’t need to seek for <em>new</em> signs but instead do as the Lord said and “discern the signs of the times”.</p>
<p>By seeking to see His hand, we find the signs.</p>
<p>It’s wicked to seek for a sign, because wicked means “unrepentant”. An unrepentant soul, one who is not going to Heavenly Father and seeking His love, doesn’t see the Hand of God in their life. As a result, they are without his signs (<a href="../concepts/gratus-sum-ergo-habeo.html">Gratus sum, ergo habeo</a>).</p>
<p>So to see signs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Repent (desire a connection with Heavenly Father and His son)</li>
<li>Look for them (discern)</li>
</ol>
<p>Presto poof.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Early Morning Workouts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/early-morning-workouts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I played football when in middle and high school. Part of the high school routine was early morning summer workouts.</p>
<p>6:30 am is brutal for a 16 year old kid. But getting up, going to the school to run some sprints, get a lift in, and get home by 8 to shower and go back to sleep was always a great feeling.</p>
<p>I’m grateful that to this day I still value exercise. I know the benefits it gives me. I also know how to lift properly so I don’t hurt myself. I also have muscle/ligament memory where it’s easier to pick up after 6months of not exercising compared to someone starting from scratch. (Maybe that’s not a scientific thing, but I feel like it is 😂).</p>
<p>I’m slightly less grateful that my 16 year old self could bench more than I’ll ever again be able to bench, and run more than I’ll ever again have time to run, but perhaps I’m grateful I can challenge myself to surpass my teenage years.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>These chapters teach me:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to overcome adversity (prayer)</li>
<li>Some people never change (Laman and Lemuel)</li>
<li>People who don’t like the message usually reject it and denounce it (Laman and Lemuel)</li>
<li>The love of God is accessible to all</li>
<li>The Lord invites all, even if He knows they won’t listen</li>
<li>Those who come can fully appreciate the beauty of the Lord’s love</li>
<li>If you take your eyes off the Savior, and care what people think instead, you can feel shame which can drive you to leave Him</li>
<li>The scriptures are written with a specific purpose: they don’t know. They’re doing what the Lord wants them to do.</li>
<li>The Lord will teach those about the Tree of Life who want to know about it. Nephi wasn’t any more special than anyone else. He just wanted to know.</li>
<li>The Lord works through prophets. Through the priesthood.</li>
<li>Perhaps Lehi could have been more gentle with Laman and Lemuel. But Nephi <em>did</em> mention the “tender feelings” that Lehi had for them, so maybe Laman and Lemuel just didn’t get it</li>
<li>There’s a little bit of Laman and Lemuel and Nephi and Sam and Lehi and Sariah in all of us.</li>
<li>Over time, the prophecies are revealed and fulfilled.</li>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Similarities</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/similarities.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything truly unique about any one individual? At the very least, any two people probably have eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose. They probably have brain and a heart. Probably have fingers and toes.</p>
<p>Probably have feelings. Experience love. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Resentment. Joy. Elation. Fear. Anxiety. Doubt. Faith. Fulfillment. Hope.</p>
<p>The reason why they feel these things will certainly be unique to them, but likely follow the themes of family, friends, food, shelter, fulfillment, etc.</p>
<p>I learned after being in Honduras for 6 weeks just how different I was from people across the world.</p>
<p>6 months later I learned (over time) just how deeply similar they are.</p>
<p>After 2 years I came home and deeply missed Honduras. I felt alone and lost in this American world.</p>
<p>Now I’m somewhere in between. But the point is: I’m grateful that humans can connect at a deeply human level no matter who they are or where they’re from.</p>

<p>2024-01-21 - “Attend to it” - Joseph Senior supported Joseph. The Angel wanted Joseph to know this. - David’s field being ploughed overnight - a few items were left for David - the Lord did just enough. Also, the Lord honored the man’s request and didn’t disrespect him. The man got what he wanted, David did some more work, and the unnecessary part was finished by whomever. - Joseph’s trouble was being heavily persecuted physically. Like the Israelites. Now, physical persecution has mostly stopped and instead it’s just verbal assaults at “the church” from press and random voices on social media. The challenge of our day is to remain faithful.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 8 - Press Forward Continually</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/choosing-to-press-forward.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Obtaining the love of Christ is not easy:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-8.24">1 Nephi 8.24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, He loves us unconditionally. But it is up to us to come to Him.</p>
<p>He constantly invites us to come to Him, and because He gives us agency (<a href="../christianity/stop-trying-to-change-people.html">Stop trying to change people. Stop it.</a>), we have to choose to follow Him.</p>
<p>This choice isn’t an easy one. It’s a difficult one. Some of us get tired and let go. Or we get distracted by all there is around us. Whatever the case - God’s love for us is constant. It’s there. It’s available. It’s at the tree. It’s felt through meaningful prayer (<a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a>). It’s felt through studying His words. It’s by building a relationship that we come to Him. It’s hard work, but it’s the way we experience the delicious fruit.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Social Gatherings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/social-gatherings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week I went to a tiny venue concert. The person who invited me said, “Can you believe that just two years ago we were forbidden to gather like this?”</p>
<p>We were listening to a Honky Tonk/Rockability Banjo jammer who just absolutely slayed the whole night. The energy was off the charts. Everyone was dancing and having a great time.</p>
<p>I’m glad and grateful we can get together again.</p>

<p>2024-01-22 - father poem. Father forgets. - bate the hook to please the fish - Tell them what they want - And how to get it - Lavish with praise. This is greater incentive than any criticism - What do they want? (Not what do I want?) “smoking will keep you from making the bball team” - Ford: put yourself in their position. Consider it. And consider your own - Consider how they’ll receive your email. They have a ton of problems. They’re overwhelmed. Don’t sell them. Teach them the benefits they’ll get. - Flattery vs appreciation - flattery is lip service. If you’re trying to convince someone to do something and you’re using flattery, then thats manipulation. And you’re prone to get angry if they don’t want to do it (kids). But if you’re sincere, you’ll find a solution - Arouse in others an eager want - Don’t tell someone an idea. Plant the seed and make them think it’s their own.</p>
<p>2024-01-20 - 85% of success is in non-technical skills. Communication. - We grow far faster by rewarding good behavior than punishing bad behavior - Kids. - Futility of criticism - Ask questions. “Does your hard hat not fit properly? It will save you.” - Don’t kick a beehive if you want honey - “I don’t see how I could have done any better” - Criticism - Abraham Lincoln never sent the letter -</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Baby Formula</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/baby-formula.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Baby formula is a miracle. According to the internet, without it, people would either use cows milk, goats milk, etc and mix it with water and honey.</p>
<p>The fact that people can go to the store and buy food to feed their infant is a miracle. It’s one of the things that has reduced infant mortality.</p>

<p>I already like this one better. It lays things out better i feel. More chronological. But perhaps it’s because he has more time to write it.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 10 - Rely on the Redeemer</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-10-rely-on-the-redeemer.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As people, we are consistently imperfect:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-10.6">1 Nephi 10.6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blessing of this imperfection is a constant reminder that to become who we need to, we need to rely on the Savior.</p>
<p>This isn’t a one-time thing. Perhaps it’s like walking up a slippery hill. There are grips on our knee pads, but not on our shoes.</p>
<p>Kneel in prayer to rely on the Redeemer.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 9 - Write with a Purpose</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-9-write-with-a-purpose.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Book of Mormon has a purpose:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have received a commandment of the Lord that I should make these plates, for the special purpose that there should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-9.3">1 Nephi 9.3</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/img/dalle-writing-on-gold-plates.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Write with a purpose. Journal with a purpose.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Then the other plates had a different purpose:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions of my people. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-9.4">1 Nephi 9.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What purpose does my writing have? What is the purpose of this blog?</p>
<p>When we write, it helps to have a purpose. It guides the writing. How does writing for entertainment differ from writing to try to change someone’s life by inviting them to Christ? The Book of Mormon is written for the later.</p>
<p>Let us write. Write with a purpose.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Things I Don’t Understand</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/things-i-dont-understand.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I don’t know about or understand a lot of things. Here’s a random list:</p>
<ul>
<li>molecular biology</li>
<li>brain surgery</li>
<li>Shakespeare</li>
<li>Diplomacy between nations</li>
<li>Best teaching methods for four year olds</li>
<li>How the heater in my house works</li>
<li>How Apple Silicon works</li>
<li>A lot of data science stuff despite working as a data scientist for 10 years</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing with knowledge is that the more you get of it, the more questions you have about the world. It was kind of hard even making that list above because I know enough to know that I don’t know enough about it. What about all the things I know nothing about. Or scarier, what about the things I think I know something about but really don’t.</p>
<p>All these things mean there’s something to be learned on every day, every minute. The world is full. We are all multi-faceted individuals who can do a ton of different things. Perhaps often we compare ourselves to those who know most about a subject vs the value and opportunity we bring with the unique set of knowledge each of us has accumulated.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’m usually wrong. It means there’s a better way. And if things turned out okay <em>and</em> I’m wrong, that’s even better: it means I can improve!</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’m able to learn from anyone on earth, who at least has a guaranteed different life experience and set of knowledge gained. I’m also grateful that everyone else is as imperfect as me, which means I can challenge them to figure out how they came to their knowledge and whether their knowledge is actually that or just a belief/opinion/etc.</p>
<p>All of this is fun, gives diversity to life, lets me know that there’s hope for a better world.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Music</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/music.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Music is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I’m not much of a musician, but I do love it. The first time I learned to play the guitar I felt a new form of communication.</p>
<p>I had known the piano before that, having played it in high school. But there was something about the guitar that taught me how to speak with music.</p>
<p>You speak with random noises from your mouth, surely you can speak with emotion from a musical instrument.</p>
<p>And people do. Great musicians communicate something in a way that words alone cannot express. And sometimes the music itself evokes an identity you didn’t know existed.</p>
<p>That’s the power of music. And I think it’s really cool that humans all over the world understand this power.</p>

<p>Reminds me as well of a close friend who wrote an album when a loved one passed away. Those were some of the most beautiful lyrics and music I had ever heard. Sometimes the best music comes from nobodies, including yourself.</p>

  <title>The Power of Habitual Prayer</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I want to share my experience with how prayer has turned from not very meaningful to substantively helpful in a matter of a few short weeks.</p>
<p>Consider the scene:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Children jumping on beds. Refusing to get dressed or brush their teeth or go to the bathroom. Screaming from the other room. Screaming from this room. Exhausted after a long day. I just want things to change and be different.<sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any parent comes across this more than once per day.</p>
<p>Most of last year I felt like I wasn’t getting a whole lot out of my prayers. A few comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>I try praying daily. But I found it hard to focus. Praying out loud helps with this, but I didn’t do it often.</li>
<li>even though I felt my prayers not well focused, I do believe God heard them regardless and by praying in an unfocused state I could still get <em>something</em> out of the experience. I believe God looks down on us when we’re trying, rather ineffectually, to do our best</li>
<li>I felt like my prayers were ineffective because I’d pray and mumble and think about work until I’d come back to me being in a prayer and then I’d say Amen. I’d always wondered what my experience would be like if I really felt a connection to God.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay. So that’s last year. Lots of prayers. I know God loves me regardless of how effective they are. And I know they could be better.</p>
<p>Back to the scene. There were several times last year when the kids were nuts and I needed to calm myself down. It was hard. I tried a few times to go and pray but just felt like “it’s not working!” Im praying! Why can’t I get to a better state of mind?! This prayer thing isn’t working for me and I’m doing it wrong.</p>
<p>I never felt like prayer wasn’t good or useful. Just that I couldn’t get it to do what I wanted it to do for me: fix me. I figured: maybe I need to pray differently. Or try XYZ thing.</p>
<p>Okay, so throw up a prayer and hope it sticks. Change me! I’m here.</p>
<p>Nope. Didn’t work. I’d still be struggling with patience in those circumstances.</p>
<p>Last night I had a new experience. I <em>did</em> pray the same way I’ve prayed before when stressed. No, I didn’t get fixed - God doesn’t fix us like that. Instead, while praying I remembered a mindset <a href="../christianity/find-the-fun.html">Find the Fun</a> that I had discovered last week. That’s all that came to mind. I left the prayer still agitated because a kid was about to jump on another kid while I was praying and I had to leave the prayer.</p>
<p>What happened though? I was just like 20% less stressed as I tried focusing on <a href="../christianity/find-the-fun.html">Find the Fun</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, so the night went better than it did last week. I had something in my mind to hold on to.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between the me yesterday and the me of three weeks ago? I changed my relationship with prayer.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to have just one good prayer per day. It’s a goal for this year. And a good prayer is one where I try to get some type of insight. Like meditation. Just pray until an insight. Setting a timer helps me. Doing it in my office or a place where I’m alone helps too. And when I’m done, I write down the insight.</p>
<p>Most of the time the insight isn’t like from God or anything. I don’t hear a voice. I don’t have any mental image. The insight for me usually comes from me hearing myself pray. “Oh, I didn’t realize that was on my mind” or “oh, how did I think of that?” I’ve come to learn that this is a spiritual prayer. This <em>is</em> praying by the spirit. When I desire to connect with God (get something out of my prayer), I’m elevated ever so slightly (<a href="../gratitude/small-things.html">I’m grateful for small things</a>).</p>
<p>And that’s it: I’ve been doing this for about two or weeks now and my relationship with prayer is changing. I no longer want it to fix me. I see it as a way to try to connect with heaven in a small way.</p>
<p>And that’s the realization: the power of prayer isn’t in the hail Mary’s. It’s in the consistent relationship with it.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> believe a Hail Mary is better than no Hail. So hail away.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities; <strong>nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries</strong> <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-21.15">Mosiah 21.15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord hears your cries even if you’re wicked. Pray regardless. But there is a concept of Him being slow to hear at times: feeling the effect of prayer requires consistency. But he’s happy to help any time we come to Him. He’s not vindictive. He’s not “I told you so” or “you should be coming to me more often than this”. That’s how we treat each other, with pride. God isn’t like that. Heavenly Father wants us to come to him, and he’ll hear our cries.</p>
<p>Translating this to me: i wasn’t wicked or anything. I was just a stressed out dad. But I think the principle applies: if I have a lackluster relationship with prayer then he’ll be slow to hear. Or, said another way, <em>I’ll</em> be slow to hear. Slow to see. More reactive. More knee jerky and less patient. More thinking “why doesn’t this prayer thing work for me?”</p>
<p>So that’s my insight. Make prayer meaningful and it starts to pay dividends slowly. Very slowly. But I also believe in compounding interest.</p>
<p>if your investments gain 0.1% each day of the year, do you know what your returns would be over a year? 44% increase. So if you invest $100 today, by the end of the year you’ll have $144 if you keep reinvesting your returns. Thats insanely good! But that’s math. that’s compounding interest.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>So shoot for a 0.1% prayer. That’s all it’s gotta be to get massive returns.</p>
<p>So that’s the invitation: try to make prayer meaningful (whatever that means to <em>you</em>, not me). And try to do it consistently.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness. <a href="../scriptures/alma-34.26">Alma 34.26</a></p>
</blockquote>

<li id="fn1"><p>while writing this the insight came: I’m in the state of mind of wanting them to change. This is a mindset of control (<a href="../christianity/stop-trying-to-change-people.html">Stop trying to change people. Stop it.</a>). The fallacy a mind believes is “if only they’re better I’d be at more peace”. Consider the alternative: if they were peaceful but I’m still in a mindset of control. Would I be happier? Perhaps I would feel more comfortable (less noise in my ear). But I’m going to posit that a person in a mindset of control, regardless of whether they’re being listened to and their control is being obeyed, aren’t happy and aren’t mindful. They aren’t present with what is. A healthier mindset for me might be: “anything could happen, delightful that they’re food now, but it’s okay if they misbehave. They’re kids! How can I <a href="../christianity/find-the-fun.html">Find the Fun</a> in this moment?”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The math is this: 1.001^365=1.44. Or, your daily return is 1.001. Invest $10 and you’ll have $10.01 by the end of day one. Invest $10.01 on day two and gain 0.1% and you’ll have $10.02001 by end of day two. Do this 365 times and you’ll have $10*1.001^365=$14.40↩︎</p></li>

  <title>1 Nephi 8 - Think for yourself</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-8-what-others-think.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This is an interesting scripture:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit. And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-8.27-28">1 Nephi 8.27–28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine you’re eating at a Michelin star restaurant and across the street there’s a food court at the mall with a bunch of people eating McDonalds and Burger King. And <em>they’re</em> mocking <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Reasons this relationship is so fascinating:</p>
<ul>
<li>the people in the building don’t know what the tree tastes like.</li>
<li>The people in the building are far away.</li>
<li>The people eating the fruit are able to be numbed by the perceptions of others, and aren’t focusing on their own experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>If those who became ashamed had focused instead on their own experiences it would have been delicious.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 7 - Make a Choice, Don’t go Halvsies</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-7-commitment.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="nephi-7" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>1 Nephi 7</h1>
<p>This exchange is fascinating:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them. <strong>And now, if ye have choice, go up to the land, and remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish;</strong> for thus the Spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laman and Lemuel don’t want to be in the wilderness, but when Nephi tells them they have their agency, they’re not brave enough to go back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In other words, he catches them in their rouse. “Nobody’s forcing you”, go back if you want, but if you do you’ll remember that you’re going to die there.</p>
<p>How often do we like to complain about something but not actually do anything about it? Reminds me of the quote “So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” (<a href="../scriptures/revelation-3.16">Revelation 3.16</a>)</p>
<p>If you don’t want to do anything about it, don’t complain. Vote with your feet, not your mouth. (They were voting with their feet to leave Jerusalem but voting with their mounts against it.)</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-walking-away.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">If you’re gonna walk, walk. If you’re gonna follow the prophet, follow.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>16 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to pass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they sought to take away my life, <strong>that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-7.15-16">1 Nephi 7.15–16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also interesting is how they didn’t directly want to kill Nephi (didn’t have the courage here to try), but instead just decided to leave him to die (Joseph of Egypt style).</p>
<p>This is one of those “I’m not actually sinning because I didn’t do the sin” things. Tying someone up isn’t killing them. Should they die, that’s an unfortunate derivative consequence. But <em>we</em> didn’t kill him. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Backing up to a higher point: how often do we skirt the issue and not take full accountability? They can’t go back to Jerusalem and they can’t even properly attempt murder. They’re just lazy and without conviction all around.</p>
<p>But so are we. We all have these tendencies to disassociate from accountability for our life:</p>
<ul>
<li>well X person is annoying. “Are you going to talk to them?” No…</li>
<li>Etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>Own up. # Other Verses of Interest</p>
<p>Today I liked these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write, but the things <strong>which are pleasing unto God and unto those who are not of the world.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-6.5">1 Nephi 6.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I someone who is not of this world? Fascinating question because it makes me wonder what is “the world”. What was Nephibtrying to define here? Perhaps he was summarizing in his own way that those who have their head in the spiritual clouds will love these things, while those who live by “the world” won’t. It’s also reflective of his experience trying to share the gospel that some people don’t care. They just want to enjoy the pineapples and what not. Am I distracted by money, fame, greed, envy?</p>
<hr>
<p>I also got a little ahead and listened to this scripture:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For it came to pass after <strong>I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me</strong>, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-11.1">1 Nephi 11.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My kids love to come up to my phone and say “let me see!!!” If they hear audio in another room they come sprinting.</p>
<p>Why do kids love seeing? They want to see. They’re sponges. They’re also without much experience in life so they want to see it all! Make up for lost time…</p>
<p>To become like a little child is to want to see for ourselves.</p>

  <title>The Problem with Public Opinions</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/the-problem-with-public-opinions.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>If you become a public opinion person (author, speaker, podcaster), you’re inherently inviting publicity bias.</p>
<p>A message is like a product. If it’s not well received, either through attention, clicks, or books purchased, then most people may abandon the idea. Very few (those seeking truth), are staunch advocates of an opinion not popularly received.</p>
<p>Even unpopular opinion people try out their ideas. They may rise on social media as “they want to cancel me, so trust my opinion”. That sales pitch only lasts so long as you’re a minority.</p>
<p>Point is: if your opinion gets reception, you’re less likely to change your opinion. This is a problem in politics for people who espouse something for a long time.</p>
<p>Instead we should be like Galileo: show me the data.</p>
<p>So be cautious if people like your opinion because you may be at risk of not being able to change it, either through your own evolving greed or desire for social acceptance and popularity.</p>
<p>The reception of an idea doesn’t determine its truthfulness, but the ability of the idea to stand on its own.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Look for the evidence, not the popularity</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I always try to think about this when listening to a popular author or podcaster: what about their idea has garnered popularity? Have they changed course in the face of evidence? I recall Amy Cuddy having one of the most popular Ted talks on Power Poses, only to have a Slate article come out that refused her research. She doubled down despite her research not being reproducible: the gold standard a scientist should seek.</p>
<p>Few people are like Amy Cuddy in that their ideas cannot be easily tested and so the world lazily believes them. This is the risk: when people stop thinking for themselves.</p>
<p>Things why Frank Herbert wrote <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>: to encourage people to think for themselves and not put too much trust in their leaders.</p>

<p><a href="../goals/2024-01-17.html">2024-01-17</a> update:</p>
<p>Chapter 14 of <a href="../book-review/the-quest-for-cosmic-justice.html">The Quest for Cosmic Justice</a> discusses this way better than I do here.</p>

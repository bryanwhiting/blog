  <title>Blogging with Quarto, and why I don’t use Medium anymore</title>

<section id="been-here-before-eh" class="level1">
<h1>Been here before, eh?</h1>
<p>I probably shouldn’t write this post considering I’ve also written posts “blogging with Jekyll”, “Blogdown”, and “distill” before. I’m flaky, what can I say. I’ve changed my blogging framework 7 times in 5 years (I started with blogger.com and Wordpress before Jekyll, and even used Medium for 25 posts.)</p>
<p>But it’s not my fault. There are too many static site generators and it seems that Rstudio is as flaky as me. Meaning, they built rmarkdown, created hugodown, blowdown, bookdown, and distill. Hugodown is a lightweight version of blogdown, and I never figured out why it exists. Then there’s workflowr and so many other great, random products out there.</p>
<p>Why quarto for me? It seems to have all the stuff that distill has, and then some. And given its design and collaboration with Wes McKinney (pandas guy) in building quarto, and given that Wes wrote his latest book with it, I think this will be here to stay for at least 5 years.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-do-i-avoid-medium" class="level1">
<h1>Why do I avoid Medium</h1>
<p>Why don’t I blog with Medium? I wrote 25 posts there over 9 months and loved it. It makes writing and publishing incredibly easy, which is why I did it. With distill/blogdown the limiting factor was I’d have to be at my computer to get a post in. I love writing on my phone - I have over 2000 journal entries with Day One over seven years, several of which are “draft” posts for a blog that won’t see the light of day since I don’t care about them after I’ve written it. I want to be able to blog frequently, a short little blurb to keep up my writing, and medium enabled this.</p>
<p>But 1) I didn’t get many views (not that I care) and 2) my writing is stuck on their platform (confirmed to me this week as I’ve tried several old, broken tools that attempt to export posts out of medium).</p>
<p>I got 50x the views on my blogdown site just from organic google searching. From reading other people’s <a href="https://hulry.com/medium-vs-own-blog/">posts</a> about leaving Medium, it’s seems that most traffic to Medium posts comes from outside of Medium.</p>
<p>So while I’m certainly not into blogging for the money, I wouldn’t mind getting the content to people who it can help. And if medium didn’t enable this, what is its purpose?</p>
<p>So I’m back and finally decided that I’m going to own my own platform. Seth Godin wrote a blog about this topic once. Why be on Medium, substack, Facebook, etc or any other up an coming platform? We’ll they’re all skewed toward the 1% of people who make money on the platform. Everyone else is wasting their time. So might as well own your content. And better to focus on writing than waste time catching up on every platform.</p>
<p>Also, it’s fun! There’s a fuzzy feeling to blogging.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-of-quarto" class="level1">
<h1>Future of quarto?</h1>
<p>I’m speculating here, but <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/">Quarto can be used with</a>R Studio, Jupiter or VS Code. The last editor seems excitingly suspicious.</p>
<p>Perhaps R Studio sees the writing on the wall that VS Code is taking over the IDE world and perhaps taking over the long term future of R Studio IDE. I personally don’t see why anyone would pay for R Studio when VS Code is free and has a better interface. And while R Studio has a few better integrations for R at the moment, it won’t once enough people see the light for VS Code and turn their contributions there. I’ve been using R on VSCode for two years now and it rivals R Studio in 95% of the feature set, but 100% has better window management.</p>
<p>So Quarto seems like a great opportunity for R Studio to begin monetizing on a publishing platform like R Studio connect. Platforms like Notion and Confluence are great for everyone except data scientists trying to share reproducible research. But a quarto server seems like a great way to finally bring in Python data scientists into the markdown-flavored documentation world. (Man, I personally can’t use Jupyter/Google colab notebooks when I can use R Markdown!) I’d heartedly welcome this prospect, though I have no idea what their plans for Quarto really are.</p>
<p>Till next blog post about what blogging tool I’m going to use…</p>

  <title>How to mock the value of an ML solution</title>

<p>IBM once launched a demo of speech-to-text in the early day’s of the technology. But there was a twist: it was smoke and mirrors. A typist in behind the stage was translating and typing.</p>
<p>This is a mechanical Turk.</p>
<p>In data science, we can present results or dashboards to audience members before they see anything. If you see a big reaction, you know you found a number they cared about.</p>
<p>Go ahead, write the conclusion first. Fake the chart first. Then back out the code that could produce the insights they need.</p>
<p>Sometimes, unique insights appear along the way. But most of the time you can properly gut-check whether someone will care about what you’re doing. Save time. Work backward.</p>

<p>I’ve had less meetings and more unstructured time during WFH. It can be isolating, which can slow down productivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.medium.com/6xW8fKHSfcb">Here’s a tip I read</a> today on how to be productive with unstructured time: put your to-do list directly into a calendar.</p>
<p>That way, you’ll always have time for the important things. Remove the things that take up your time and aren’t as important. I like it.</p>

  <title>Data Beats Opinions</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/2020-12-15-data-beats-opinions/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>When I co-started a company several years ago, my founders and I would canvass neighborhoods knocking doors. We’d discuss our ideas for a new product one door at a time. After each conversation, the product took a new form. Eventually, the product took shape and we had a successful kickstarter launch.</p>
<p>Since that time, I’ve thought about how valuable it was to get information straight from the source.</p>
<p>Alberto Savoia’s new book, “The Right It”, is re-teaching me this principle. Data beats opinions, he says. In another book I’m reading, “Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments”, the former CEO of Netscape is quoted saying,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If we have data, let’s go with data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine. - Jim Barksdale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data sourced from your manager, your stakeholder, or your customer are invaluable to help you know if you’re solving their problem. Too often it’s easy to get stuck in the original solution that comes to our mind.</p>
<p>Data from customers directly shape the product. Data sourced at scale from online experiments refine it.</p>
<p>Opinions from the customer shape the product. Their behavior (captured as data) speaks louder than their words. Frequently, it’s challenging to correlate the two. We’re left to guess why someone actually clicked, bought, churned. It’s a beautiful cycle.</p>

  <title>Starting with Jekyll</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Hello world.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>I wanted to start a blog. I wanted to set it up for free, use a custom URL (and not <em>something.bloggingplatform.com</em>), and be able to both blog and create tutorials. I didn’t mind it possibly being technical<sup>1</sup>. Enter Jekyll.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Specifically, I was interested in being able to use the command line for my posts. Additionally, I didn’t mind seeing or using a little bit of code.</p></li></div></div>
<p><em>If you want to get your blog in 10 minutes, skip to below.</em></p>
<section id="why-blog-with-jekyll" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Why Blog with Jekyll?</h1>
<p>Here’s why you can and should blog with Jekyll (if you’re a data scientist):</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Jekyll has beautiful, free, open-source templates.</li>
<li>GitHub will host your website for free<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li>Jekyll is <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/">static</a>.</li>
<li>Jekyll can be simple to set up<sup>3</sup>.</li>
<li>I tried Wordpress and blogger.com and got frustrated.</li>
<li>The blogging content you create is very portable (easy to take your posts from one blog site to another).</li>
<li>Creating blogs in Markdown syntax is a dream (even for non-technical folks).</li>
<li>You can manage your blog from your terminal</li>
<li>You can manage your blog from your phone (if you have a GitHub-editing app)</li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Someone has to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+it+mean+to+host+a+website&amp;oq=what+does+it+mean+to+host+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2810j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">host</a> it (i.e., store and display all the files). I started off trying to set up a WordPress blog, but you have to pay another company to <a href="http://www.webhostingbest10.com/web-hosting-reviews">host</a>. I didn’t want to bother.</p></li><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;If you try to set it up by following the instructions on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyllrb.com</a>, that’s the complicated way. That’s how I originally started, got lost for five hours, and stopped. Six months later, I found a better way.</p></li></div><p>But if you don’t like debugging occasional errors, you probably shouldn’t blog with Jekyll.</p>
<p>What is Jekyll, you ask? Jekyll is an open-source blogging platform. Anyone can write a template and post it, and anyone else can use that template. Perusing <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">Jekyllthemes.org</a>, you can pick out any template you’d like.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-did-i-get-started-with-jekyll" class="level1">
<h1>How did I get started with Jekyll?</h1>
<p>As a blogging noob, I’ve discovered there are hundreds of ways to generate a blog (e.g., WordPress, Squarespace, blogger.com, Weebly, etc.). But when my colleague <a href="http://luiarthur.github.io/">Arthur Lui</a> showed me his blog, I wanted something similar. I first tried Wordpress, then tried blogspot, then gave up and followed Arthur’s example and landed with Jekyll.</p>
</section>
<section id="set-up-a-blog-in-10-minutes" class="level1">
<h1>Set up a blog in 10 minutes!</h1>
<p>I followed this Jekyll <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">tutorial</a> to set up my first blog. I’ll simplify those steps here to get you up and running quickly:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a GitHub account. (2 min)</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">Jekyllthemes.org</a>. All of these blog themes are free. Find one you like, and Fork the repo (i.e., “repository”). (2-60 min, depending on how long you peruse)</li>
<li>In GitHub, rename the newly-forked repo from “REPO name” to “yourgithubusername.github.io”. (1 min)</li>
<li>Now go to “githubusername.github.io”. Voila, you have a blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>And if you want to start writing posts, go to your “_posts” folder. Then create new files and follow the default templates that the repository provides. (The blogs will need to be written in Markdown syntax.)</p>
<p>That was my 10 minute promise. If you feel a bit cheated or lost, go to the well-done <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">tutorial</a> and do all the steps. But the steps I listed are the essential steps to setting up a blog from scratch. So if you want to make a few blogs really quickly, after you figure out the first one the others follow nicely. For example, once I finished the tutorial, I followed those steps above to try two other themes before deciding on the <a href="https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium">Centrarium</a> theme.</p>
<p>To get Centrarium to work, I did have to change some configurations in the “_config.yml”, so there can be some minor debugging depending on the theme you choose. But with a little patience and some Googling, you’ll get it.</p>

<h1>Add to Jekyll a custom URL from GoDaddy</h1>
<p>You’ll notice I have a custom URL and not “bryanwhiting.github.io”. I used GoDaddy to get a domain. (I have no affiliation with GoDaddy.) Here’s how I linked GoDaddy with my GitHub Jekyll blog:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a domain.</li>
<li>In your Github repo, change (or create) a CNAME file in the main directory. (See my <a href="https://github.com/bryanwhiting/bryanwhiting.github.io/blob/master/CNAME">CNAME</a> file for an example). And for the CNAME file contents, just type in the new “www” that you registered through GoDaddy.</li>
<li>Then, on GoDaddy, go to the section “DNS Management”. Here’s where you tell GoDaddy how to connect your newly purchased “www” with GitHub. Create the following connections:</li>
<li>[Type, Name, Value, TTL] = [A, @, 192.30.252.153, 600 seconds]</li>
<li>[Type, Name, Value, TTL] = [A, @, 192.30.252.154, 600 seconds]</li>
<li>[Type, Name, Value, TTL] = [CNAME, ftp, yourgithubusername.github.io, 600 seconds]</li>
<li>[Type, Name, Value, TTL] = [CNAME, www, yourgithubusername.github.io, 600 seconds]</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have the CNAME file in your GitHub folder, GitHub and GoDaddy will talk and after a few minutes your custom “www” will work. You don’t technically need the two [A] steps, but those connections allow users to type “<a href="http://www.bryanwhiting.com">bryanwhiting.com</a>” instead of “www.bryanwhiting.com”. It can take up to 24 hours before these [A] connections enable, so don’t be worried if the short URL doesn’t work first try. But the full URL should work soon enough.</p>

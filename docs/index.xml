</figure>
</div>
<p>There’s no question that moods are contagious. I once asked someone at the beach to leash their dog, and they slightly rebuked me, “this is a dog friendly beach.” <em>Well, so it is,</em> I thought, grumpily. I complained to a family member about this grumpy dog owner.</p>
<p>Moods escalate. And negative moods are even more pervasive and contagious than positive ones. They say a disgruntled customer tells more friends and family than happy ones. Why is this?</p>
<p>In the “Black Cat” (<a href="../book-review/the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.html">The Best of Edgar Allen Poe</a>), Poe describes a gruesome tale man who wanted to do evil just for the sake of it. That it’s in his nature. Not because you want to do the thing, but because you want to do a forbidden thing. The same goes the other way, for sure. But I think we trend slightly pessimistic because being an optimist is more beneficial, more rewarding and therefore more difficult.</p>
<p>A leader once told me when I was managing a team, “They’ll pick up on <em>everything</em> you do or say.” Oddly, I was picking up on what he was saying.</p>
<p>So when you lead, lead carefully. Whether in home or work, lead with kindness, compassion, and restraint. Speak three kind words before a negative. Ask to understand before assuming. Lead as a servant. It takes all the effort to overcome negative vibes, and who better equipped than the leader to do it?</p>
<p>Don’t be Moriarty:</p>

<p>“Why can’t you be more hopeful for a change?”</p>

  <title>The Dream State of Software</title>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Dreaming code working is ever coders dream</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I returned from vacation yesterday and tried running my code. It didn’t work. I looked at code I had written, it had my imports correctly and all - why wasn’t it running?</p>
<p>The file it was importing didn’t exist.</p>
<p>I thought I created that. I swear I made it. My coworker remarked, “oh so you set up all the scafffolding but didn’t write the actual code?” I was in disbelief. maybe it was deleted by accident or stashed on another branch. But the <code>git log</code> shows all: the imported file never existed.</p>
<p>In <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>, Paul Atriedes has many visions and the author uses this feature to skip the book ahead three years. Paul wakes up one morning and doesn’t know what’s past or future. It’s all one in his mind.</p>
<p>So it is with software. It gets created in the mind near instantly. Coding is a burden, the journey of many failures and design choices to enable the simple vision of the mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps Gen AI can help us dream software faster. I look forward to when my dreams are realities, and not the rude awakening I still have coding to do.</p>

  <title>My Tombstone</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/my-tombstone.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>They call it a death meditation, to look back from the end of your life and reflect as if you had just died (out of body style). Here’s my tombstone:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Here lies Bryan, son of Aragon, data scientist extraordinaire who knew how to use regular expressions and properly test linear regression assumptions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seem like a good tombstone?</p>
<p>Why do we measure our lives by something nobody cares about? Consider Steve Jobs, Isaac Newton, or whomever you idolize. What are they known for? Only a few things.</p>
<p>I read <a href="../book-review/steve-jobs-biography.html">Steve Jobs (Biography)</a> a while back. And I also read <a href="../book-review/leonardo-da-vinci.html">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. First was 25 hours, second was 17 hours. And guess what - that’s less than two days combined. Two “impressive” lives summed up in a few days.</p>
<p>My grandma’s obituary was brief. Yet her life was filled with millions of unwritten sentences - many written on my life. The in between moments. The laying around moments. The relationship moments. (Maybe it’s called a relation-“ship” because it sails the waters of life continuously, despite the infrequent dock postings.)</p>
<p>Nobody’s going to remember me, except those who call me dad, husband, brother, son, and friend. And I’m okay with that. I was never that good at data science anyway 😉.</p>

  <title>The Psychology of New Software Releases and its Parallels with Fashion</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/why-we-want-new-software.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>What is it about a new release that gets people excited? Would you buy software that never changes? How about a hammer?</p>
<p>Why are we okay with buying a hammer, but not stagnant software? Our culture is addicted to new widgets. A/B testing.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Shipping software like fashion, every season</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Software releases are free, but development is not. Therefore, research and development is constant, whereas the Hammer company hasn’t needed to update its product in a couple…millennia. That’s why they call it software. It’s not hard to make.</p>
<p>Is there a way to sell software like you sell a hammer?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;Because per <a href="../book-review/innovators-dilemma.html">Innovator’s Dilemma</a>, those who can out-do you will. And software is easy to alter and improve. I’m not convinced all “updates” done in the software industry are actually improvements, but people like change. Ever see a fashion line repeat itself?</p>
<p>Software is like fashion.</p>

<p>Notes: - socrates had a voice he felt was from Gods. Daimonion - Memorization. Lots of it. - Humanism - treated sacrifices to the gods as transactional. This meant they relied on themselves rather than gods to teach them. - Odd relationships (pedophelia) - function: intended purpose. Virtue: quality of function.</p>

  <title>Replacing human work with AI</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/swapping-out-human-labor-for-ai.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/4-questions-to-ask-swapping-out-human-labor-ai">recent MIT article</a>, the author discusses how to know if you’re ready for AI adoption. It boils things down to a rather obvious four-step questioning process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How much time would I save if I used AI?</li>
<li>How expensive is the task? (How expensive is the salary of the person doing the task.)</li>
<li>How capable is the AI of completing the task successfully?</li>
<li>How easy is it to determine if the output is good/correct?</li>
</ol>
<p>I say obvious because these are actually just questions you’d ask of any task worth doing by any person at your company. In every decision in running a business, there is an ROI question at play - what does this person cost me, what’s the return?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-ai-task-vs-human.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">It’s not: “should I use AI?” It’s “how?”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="knowing-what-you-dont-know-and-how-to-know-you-know-it" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Knowing what you don’t know, and how to know you know it</h1>
<p>The author lays out the hypothetical “I asked this ChatGPT to write something in Perl and it did it well on the second try!”</p>
<p>Consider that. Do you know what Perl is? Would you know how to evaluate if the code is complete? How would you execute such code - do you know the programs to run?</p>
<p>AI cannot solve these environmental, contextual problems yet. It can’t think through all the nuance. And, if you have an expensive salary, there’s a reason: you have a lot of experience. Experience to know what Perl is. Experience to recognize the code’s flaws and poor design patterns. This makes you all the more valuable <em>with</em> AI.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a highly creative, curious person could just ask AI “what programming languages are good for this task?” Like Neo in <em>The Matrix</em> when he “downloads kung-foo” into his brain, we all can get up to speed a lot faster.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I’ve read stories of people without technical backgrounds building websites with GPT. On the surface this is cool. Now do they care to keep doing that? Is that their personality? Are they going to get bored? This is the differentiator. And the people who stick with GPT to build a website and remain curious are the ones who will get ahead. Those who give up won’t.</p></li></div></section>
<section id="how-do-i-adopt-ai-not-should" class="level1">
<h1><em>How</em> do I adopt AI? (Not “should”)</h1>
<p>To me, the question isn’t “do these four questions check the box”? Instead, I see AI as an always-on strategy with various ranges of usefulness:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do you care what the final product looks like?
<ul>
<li>Are you okay with an 80% solution?</li>
<li>Is this throwaway work?</li>
<li>Do you plan to maintain this code as part of a 10,000 line code base?</li>
<li>Do you just need ideas to get started?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the risks in firing my experts?
<ul>
<li>Who will catch the mistakes of the AI? What if it’s wrong?</li>
<li>In many aspects of your business the risk of being wrong might be a lot lower than you think.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What <em>can’t</em> it do well?
<ul>
<li>Assume AI is doing everything at your company - what would that look like?</li>
<li>Give AI the benefit of the doubt first, then work backward from what it can’t do.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>I think that AI holds great power to aid our jobs in a lot of ways. It <em>will</em> replace a lot of jobs, just as there are far fewer farmers today than a hundred years ago. Those farmers are far more effective than ever before - we get more yield for less. It will replace <em>part</em> of your job - the stuff you know how to do but would rather have someone else do it.</p>
<p>Coders <em>will</em> be highly automatable, especially those who think otherwise. Lawyers. Graphic designers. Marketers. This is a cycle as old as time: people and businesses who think they have a strong hold on the market (think: BlackBerry, <em>Innovators Dilemma</em>) are the ones who always get eclipsed. # Learn the new skillset</p>
<p>Have everyone at your company use it today. It’s the new programming language. It’s the new way of authoring. And yes, prompt engineering (how you ask it questions) widely impacts its usefulness. Therefore, we all need to learn how to prompt engineer.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is the new skillset: <strong>knowing what question to ask and how to pressure test its validity</strong>. In essence, the learning acceleration curve has skyrocketed, and one person can now actually be good at many things a lot faster. It’s the curious person who will win. It’s the visionary. The evaluator. The one who knows where they want to go, can discern if the steps they’re taking are taking them to their destination, and who have the ability to adapt and course correct when necessary.</p>
<p>For now, AI can hardly do things outside data it was trained on. In the future 10 years that may change. If so, we’ll all be on the edge of scientific discovery, pushing the bounds of creative work, and focusing on the nuance that will win/lose that legal case. AI will have a seat at the table. But so will we.</p>

<p>The book <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> is amazing in many ways, but the one that piqued my curiosity today was this: what if water was a currency?</p>
<p>The book gives great reverence to water, specifically talking about the lengths the Fremen go to to preserve their water. They even harvest it the dead, as water is life. They see people around them as water vessels. If you’re 100 kg (220lbs), they say you carry 60 kg of water weight. That’s a 60 liters. If you drink an average of 2 liters per day, that’s enough water to sustain you for 30 days. Fascinating how you would die without drinking water for a week though, right?</p>
<p>Some on this earth live with such water scarcity. Most in the US don’t. Consider what else we can focus on because we take the most life-giving substance for granted.</p>

  <title>Emotional Recovery</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Imagine you just ran a red light at 10:15pm. You were driving without music or phone distractions, you just zoned out and coasted through.</p>
<p>Your emotions run high as you consider what might have happened otherwise. But nothing happened. Something <em>could</em> have happened, but nothing did. In the end, all is well.</p>
<p>How do you calm yourself down? In <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>, someone almost dies because of Paul’s “mistake”. But nobody died.</p>
<p>Life is full of thousands of these things. Several of them we recognize and brush off “oh that was close.” But how many events go unnoticed because we were unaware we even could have done harm (no red light to be found)?</p>
<p>How we identify and recover is a skill. How do you process such experiences? How do you get over the person who cuts you off on the highway? How do you get over not realizing you cut someone off?</p>

  <title>Quarto vs. quartz for Obsidian blog</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/quarto-vs-quartz-for-obsidian.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Things I like/dislike about <code>quarto</code> are listed <a href="../posts/quarto-feature-requests/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, I love <code>quarto</code> and the main thing I don’t like about quarto is how slow it is, compared to say, <code>hugo</code>.</p>
<p>I looked heavily into <code>quartz</code>, which is explained <a href="https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/">here</a> as a way to publish your Obsidian vault on GitHub. And <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/">here’s an example</a> of a digital garden someone uses with <code>quartz</code>, it’s pretty slick. Here are the <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features">features of quartz</a>.</p>
<p>Why <code>quarto</code>? I really like the design of a blog, as I tend to think better in “post” form rather than never-ending-garden-of-thoughts. I like reading blogs because I assume the thoughts are complete. Quartz is great if you just want your own wiki. I just don’t really care about the network graphs and all and I don’t think other people reading them care either.</p>
<p>I want to focus on writing and sometimes long form writing. Quarto enables a lot, is easy to setup and customize, has great search, has a ton of markdown desires (tabs, callouts, asides, footnotes), can render code (Python/R) when I want to be adventurous, and has a blog interface for posts.</p>
<p>Largely they’re the same, and maybe I’ll use quartz at some point. But I’m happy where I am now.</p>

  <title>Blogging with Obsidian and Quarto</title>

<div class="callout callout-style-simple callout-tip no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>First half is my philosophy on the relationship between learning, notetaking, and blogging.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love to learn</li>
<li>Writing helps me learn</li>
<li>Publicly writing increases my focus</li>
</ul>
<p>Second half is how I use Obsidian and Quarto, alternatives I’ve tried, and my actually flow. I detail what tools I use, how I use them.</p>
<ul>
<li>set up relative links</li>
<li>Have one img folder</li>
<li>Use templater to manage new post templates and relative links</li>
<li>Use linter</li>
<li>Use commander for toolbar palette</li>
<li>dataview to find drafts</li>
<li>Tags to flag ideas</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I’ve had a blog since 2016. Started with Jekyll. Then blogdown. Tried medium in 2020 because it had a good mobile app and I was able to publish every day. Then I didn’t know how to get my posts out of there so I lost interest. Then I found quarto, which I was excited about because I have always loved Rmarkdown (things like tabs, executable code, etc.). Then I tried Substack, which I did for a few weeks but eventually gave up because 1) no mobile app to write and 2) how do I get my stuff off of there?</p>
<p>Seth Godin writes every day, and I love his blog and take it as an inspiration. In one post he mentions how “some say do a podcast, others say write on platform x or platform Y”. (Medium, Substack, etc.) He recommends: those tools always serve the 1%. If you’re the 1%, you make money. Otherwise you don’t. So you might as well own your own content.</p>
<p>I know two Instagram and TikTok influencers with 100k and 300k followers respectively. The 100k made $5k in 2022. The 300k TikToker still makes maybe $100/mo. They each put in 20 hours+ a week.</p>
<p>So I’m giving up the illusion I’ll ever make money off a blog or my content. I write because I always have. I write publicly now because I found a way to do so online, from my phone.</p>
<p>This is how I blog daily using quarto (for the website) and Obsidian (for the editor).</p>
<section id="own-your-platform" class="level1">
<h1>Own your platform</h1>
<p>After all the years blogging, giving up, coming back, etc, there are many things that are my personal needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile first. I can’t write at my computer. This isn’t my job.</li>
<li>Footnotes: many blogging platforms don’t allow for them or handle them well. Footnotes are essential in long content.</li>
<li>Customizable: I need to be able to add styling how I like it. This is part of the creative process.</li>
<li>Tags: having and filtering by tags is nice</li>
<li>Portable: if I stop blogging for 9 months I need to be able to move it to the next shiny object platform. I need to own my content. I also don’t like posting on LinkedIn or Facebook directly because I see my writing as my creative work. Those platforms don’t let you save or share those links later on.<br>
</li>
<li>Relative links: I need to be able to link to other posts. This is part of the mental note taking journey.</li>
<li>Subscribe button. (Substack and Medium are built for this!)</li>
<li>Comments: 99% of people don’t comment, but when people reach out it feels like I did something for the world. It also makes the blog more approachable, even if nobody every posts.</li>
<li>Hackable/automatable: I need templates. I need code. I need to be able to automate things. (At one point I figured out how to set up automations to post straight to Instagram from GitHub actions. I’m going to bring that back!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Substack does footnotes well, linking to notes poorly, doesn’t have a mobile editor for posts, and isn’t portable. It handles tags, subscribers, and distribution extremely well, and makes it easy to have multiple publications. But it’s got the vendor lock in.</p>
<p>Medium had an excellent mobile editing experience, but again - vendor lock in. And you’ve gotta kinda buy into the Medium-way-of-doing-posts.</p>
<p>All platforms have their vibe. If you want to be popular on TikTok, you gotta dance. Although I personally love to dance, I want my site to be creative and my own.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-blog-with-obsidianquarto" class="level1">
<h1>Why blog with obsidian/quarto?</h1>
<p>Enter Obsidian and Quarto. Obsidian makes managing and editing content a breeze (things like draft management, sorting files, organizing images, etc is all super easy):</p>
<p>Why obsidian as my editor?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It makes writing markdown a breeze</li>
<li>It has tons of extensions, such as managing footnotes, linting files, spell checking, etc.</li>
<li>It makes it really easy to link to other files (relative links)</li>
<li>It makes it easy to refactor (move stuff around)</li>
<li>It works with markdown. The files are just plain text files in my Files app on my iPhone.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="writing-flow" class="level1">
<h1>Writing flow</h1>
<p>Every writer has their flow. The tools they use should reflect their mental process of writing, and not the other way around. If you’re trying to get your brain to work like the tool does, rather than using tools that working like your brain, you’re ngmi. If you’re like me, you’ll try it for a while and then give up. (I may give up after this post, but at least this post isn’t saved on Blogger.com!)</p>
<p>Here’s mine:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get an idea</li>
<li>Categorize it (religious, tech, life, etc)</li>
<li>Create a file</li>
<li>Mark as draft</li>
<li>Write some ideas</li>
<li>Edit it (if long), reread a few times</li>
<li>Unmark as draft</li>
<li>Post to the internet, read a few more times in live version and make edits</li>
<li>Tag it</li>
<li>Find old drafts, finish them</li>
<li>Add an image, either from my phone camera or chatgpt. Save image in the right folder.</li>
<li>Write alt text to the images.</li>
<li>Create links to other entries.</li>
<li>Make some footnotes for content that doesn’t flow</li>
<li>Cry and debate if I’m a good writer or if anyone is even listening anymore</li>
<li>Add a subscribe button</li>
<li>share a good one to social media</li>
<li>Check my Google analytics to see if I’m popular. Check subscribers to see if I got any. Wonder why I care anyway because I know I won’t make money off this.</li>
<li>Get an idea for a new post while reading a book and start again</li>
</ol>
<p>The process of getting ideas from a source, and writing from those ideas, makes me want to be able to connect the entry to the source (book or podcast). Sure, I don’t have to write. And sometimes writing is wasted time (writing for writing’s sake), but I enjoy it.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-writing-flow-with-obsidian-and-quarto" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>My writing flow with Obsidian and Quarto</h1>
<p>At the risk of nobody ever reading this far, I’ll keep this high level, and if someone cares about something ask me in the comments.</p>
<p>First, see <a href="../posts/quarto-from-phone/index.html">Quarto from Phone</a> to see how I set up Working Copy to sync my Obsidian repo with GitHub.</p>
<p>Here’s my flow with obsidian:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Read a book. Create new book note using <a href="../_templates/new-post.md">new-post</a> via the Templater obsidian plugin. This lets me create a new note in a folder of my choice, give a title, make a filename with a good url slug. Adds some categories automatically.</li>
<li>When idea comes up, take note in book note. When substantial idea comes up, create a quick draft of a new post using Templater. Enable draft: true if i don’t finish.</li>
<li>Use Obsidian Dataview to create a list of all outstanding drafts. I can come back and finish.</li>
<li>Use Obsidian Custom Sort to sort the files in my repo how I want. This package helped me to stop time-stamping my URLs (which I thought was good for sorting). Instead, I can sort by modified time (note custom sort isn’t necessary for modified time sorting), but custom sort allows for sorting by yaml front matter.</li>
<li>When I’m ready to post, create an image using ChatGPT app. Click on the image in the app, share, save to files. It will save to the img/ folder in my root. Next image? Saves here (iPhone remembers).
<ol type="1">
<li>At some point I was creating folders for every blog post so I could reference images there. I’m giving this up for two reasons: 1) every file would then need to be named “index.md” and 2) more folders is more noise. So instead, I have one place for all images, which makes it easier to save and I don’t have to click a bunch of subfolders every time I add an image.</li>
<li>Also, screenshot any photos you may want to add so as to remove the location metadata.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Use Footnote Shortcut plugin to more efficiently write footnotes. Add a hotkey to the mobile obsidian editor toolbar to quickly add footnotes. <sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Set up an iOS shortcut to do a “git pull”, “git commit”, “git push” on the repo. Put this shortcut on my home page. Since I have a synced folder, this happens very efficiently!<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>Set up a github actions to build the blog using <code>quarto render</code>. See <a href="../posts/quarto-vs-quartz-for-obsidian.html">Quarto vs.&nbsp;quartz for Obsidian blog</a></li>
<li>Publish to GitHub pages with the docs/ folder.</li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;This footnote is added with the tap of a button. Brilliant!</p></li><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;You can also set up an automation to sync anytime you leave the app, but I’ve found that gets kind of annoying because sometimes there can be data loss with a git pull that happens without thinking about it.</p></li></div><p>And that’s it. That’s my flow. If you like this, ask me a question.</p>

<p>What is my best decision? Worst?</p>
<ul>
<li>resulting: focusing on outcomes, rather than expected values and doing the best</li>
<li>to improve decision making: focus on what the process was for decision making. Information gathering. Question asking.</li>
<li>Remember choosing to leave Novi, wondering if someone was going to be a millionaire in my absence. Couldn’t help but feel I was leaving money on the table by leaving. But I decided to leave to pursue what I was passionate about, and regardless that Novi went under I felt that was the right call as I finished my masters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions: - make a knowledge tracker. Details on decisions. Info known before/after. Make this going forward</p>
<p>Decision process: - where do you want to go? - What are all the ways to get there? - By taking X choice, what are other ways it could go? What’s the probability?</p>

  <title>Leaving my Startup was the Right Decision</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/leaving-my-startup-was-the-right-decision.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I remember in 2014 deciding whether to leave my startup after having just helped raise a seed round and finish a highly successful kickstarter. It was either move with the team to Seattle or stay and finish my Master’s degree. My married cofounder even suggested “you could find your wife here!”</p>
<p>I imagined every scenario in my anxiety. I specifically imagined all of my partners making $1M dollars or something. I felt like the decision to leave was a decision to not be a millionaire.</p>
<p>I emotionally came to terms with that possibility. And suddenly, that possible outcome had no allure to me anymore.</p>
<p>I chose to finish my degree and pursue a career in data science. I also luckily found my wife <em>not</em> in Seattle just a few weeks later.</p>
<p>I’ve made this choice a few times in my life: go with the direction I want to go at that time. To hop on the right <a href="../posts/decisions-are-rivers.html">river</a>.</p>
<p>This was the <strong>right</strong> decision, because I came to terms with alternate realties and chose what aligned with my goals.</p>
<p>You never know what happens when you <a href="../posts/flip-a-coin.html">flip-a-coin</a>. But you can choose whether to flip.</p>

  <title>Flipping the coins of life</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Assume you flip a coin 5 times and get heads 5 times. You’re going pretty well!</p>
<p>But are you?</p>
<p>A normal coin has 50% chance of heads. Chances of 5 heads in a row is ~3/100. It’s not nothing. But over time this will average to 50%, if you flip 10000 times.</p>
<p>Decisions are rarely black and whites despite how we choice to say “that was a bad decision”. The outcome doesn’t determine the quality of the decision.</p>
<p>You chose to flip a coin, and not roll a dice. You didn’t roll a 32 sided die either.</p>
<p>Focus on choice that maximize probability. This is the decision.</p>

  <title>Decisions are Like Hopping on a River Raft</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a> and thinking about decisions. I like to think of decisions as rivers.</p>
<p>Like decisions, all rivers lead somewhere. Where is your river heading?</p>
<p>The decision is which river to get on in your little boat. You can only envision the destination.</p>
<p>Being a high school English teacher is a decision. Where will that life take me after 5/10/20 years? Is that appealing? Only I can choose.</p>
<p>This thinking process is the decision choice. The rest is up to luck.</p>

  <title>97 percent chance you’ll fail</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In <a href="../posts/flip-a-coin.html">Flipping the coins of life</a>, I outline how you can succeed 5 times with a success rate of 3%. That also means you have a 97% chance you won’t succeed 5 times in a row.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Flipping five coins will almost certainly yield at least tails</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In life, we sometimes overemphasize winning. Even in the tech world of wanting to fail fast, I think most people just really want to win every time. Nobody seeks failure - that’s not the goal. They seek other things (learning, promotions, making more money).</p>
<p>When making decisions, it’s easy to black-and-white them. If there’s only a 3% change we’ll win 5 times in a row (with a 50% chance of winning every time), there’s a 97% chance you’ll fail at least once every 5 attempts.</p>
<p>If your probability of success is lower, then the odds of failing at once in five are almost 100%.</p>
<p>How do you quantify a life decision though? Maybe you only get one big choice a year (job change, like as is discussed in <a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a>). Is there a 50% chance of “success”? If so, every five years you’re highly likely to “fail”.</p>
<p>Per the book, it’s more likely that one bad thing happens and we hindsight bias our decision and black-and-white it.</p>
<p>Reality is: getting fired or your startup blowing up might be the best thing that ever happens to you. You just don’t know. Your story isn’t written yet. And actually, it’s not so much about if you made the right choice as if you just make the choice right in some way.</p>
<p>Choose your love, and then love your choice, as they say.</p>

  <title>Writing is truly enlivening</title>

<p>I’ve been writing for my whole life. I have at least 15-20 journals. I have 3000 notes in one app, 2200 notes in another, at least 1800 digital journal entries over 10 years, I’ve built and replaced probably 5 blogs. This blog has 57 entries so far. What have I learned?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make writing daily as easy as possible. I set up some automation so I can write from my phone for daily blogging.</li>
<li>Writing makes things feel real for me. It helps connect the dots. It’s a far more productive way to read the news. Less stuff, more thinking. Because if I can’t write at least one useful note about something I read, I realize it wasn’t worth reading.</li>
<li>Perhaps reading is the more important daily duty. Well, to write I need something to inspire me. Usually that comes from the news. Sometimes inspiration comes from yesterday’s post. This inspiration came from editing my prior post.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not gonna worry about who reads this. But instead focus on writing every day because…</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it helps me practice storytelling</li>
<li>helps me practice communication</li>
</ul>
<p>Hamilton wrote like he was “running out of time”. I’m writing because I want to use my time how I enjoy it.</p>

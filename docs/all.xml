  <title>I’m Grateful for New Perspectives</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-perspectives.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I was a kid, I broke my wrist. I no longer would be able to play football. It was my senior year, the year where all the magic happens. The year you prepare for. The big leagues.</p>
<p>My mom told me, “when a door closes, open a window. This if life”.</p>
<p>A new perspective is an opportunity to see something that was there all along, but because of myopia you didn’t previously see it.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">I felt like this when I dove for the football. But I didn’t look like this because I didn’t catch it. Instead I broke my wrist.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Perspective is realizing that senior year wasn’t any more special than the junior year where I had fun on JV. Perspective is realizing it’s just a game. Perspective is years later realizing that something I cared so much about at the time now has little value or importance in my life, and other things have far more importance to me.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 13 - Publish Peace</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-13-publish-peace.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A lot of us have very little control over the world we’re born into. We can do a lot for our own lives, but very few of us will have the ability to change nations.</p>
<p>Which is why I love this scripture:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and <strong>whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-13.37">1 Nephi 13.37</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of your status, if you publish peace, good awaits you.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 12 - Broad Roads</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-12-broad-roads.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The modern refrain is to do and be whatever you want. While I largely agree with this refrain, there are some caveats: certain things bring us happiness. Being kind to people. Helping people. Saying sorry, etc.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and <strong>leadeth them away into broad roads</strong>, that they perish and are lost. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-12.17">1 Nephi 12.17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-image-a-hill-with-a-tree-at-the-top-a-lot-of-broad-roads-at-the-base-of-the-hill-heading-down-strange-paths.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">All the roads we can take can confuse us. Instead, we can focus on where we’re heading</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The temptation we all face is to be lured down broad roads. By contrast, the way of the Lord is the straight and narrow.</p>
<p>Once I was working with someone and I was writing my code a few ways, with a bunch of tries that had failed. I finally kept the right one along side the failures. The reviewer said “why do you keep this junk?” I thought; because it helps me remember the way to not do it. “Why not just keep the answer though?”</p>
<p>Sometimes we like to focus on the “broad” roads in a few ways.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remember all our failings, rather than focus on the things that bring us happiness. We do this as a badge of “I don’t want to repeat those bad mistakes.” Sure, the intent is good, but that’s like carrying a broken phone around with you to remind you not to drop your phone again. The effect is far more positive if we focus on the good things that come from following Christ.</li>
<li>There are a lot of paths we can go down in life. The Lord wants us to do many good things! (<a href="../christianity/turn-to-god-not-your-idols.html">Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols</a>). But there are a few roads he doesn’t want us to go down: selfishness, greed, love of money, etc. These roads are broad. There are a lot of ways to lose yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>So remember, “focus on the right answer”. Focus on the Savior, and walk towards him. Drop your load at his feet (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30.html">Matthew 11.28–30</a>).</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Navajo Code Talkers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/navajo-code-talkers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>My daughter brought home a book that introduced something I had never before heard about: Navajo code talkers.</p>
<p>Since the Navajo language had never been written down, it wasn’t able to be translated by the Japanese in WWII. And so, the Navajo would encode English words and transmit their words across the radio to talk about positions and bombs and such. It helped them win the war.</p>
<p>They chose to serve a country they were being heavily persecuted in (<a href="../book-review/killers-of-the-flower-moon.html">Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI</a>). It’s incredible to think about.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for them and all like them that helped provide the freedoms I enjoy.</p>

  <title>Writing Only Makes Sense to the Author</title>

<p><em>If you’re a bad author</em>, your writing will only make sense to you.</p>
<p>Problem is, we’re all bad authors.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>My writing makes sense as I put it fown</li>
<li>It doesn’t always make sense to me 5 minutes later (my future self is practically another person)</li>
<li>The probability of it being perfectly interpreted by someone who isn’t even me, is likely near zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>So when we write, we send out an idea. It then becomes a painting on the wall, up for anyone to interpret how they may.<sup>1</sup> therefore, it’s best to put yourself as much in your audience’s shoes as possible (something discussed often in <a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a>).</p>

  <title>Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/turn-to-god-not-your-idols.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I wrote <a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a> in the mindset of having intentional prayers. Today, I experienced another one.</p>
<section id="a-typical-day" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>A Typical Day</h1>
<p>I felt overwhelmed by a few things (just day to day life, parenting, working, making sure I get that insurance policy and that bill figured out, etc, etc, etc.)</p>
<p>I decided to see if prayer could help me get out of my funk.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-angels-in-the-crop-fields.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Pray for help in all things, and watch the Hand of the Lord reveal itself</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>During my prayer, I felt something happen. I decided I would pray until I felt a change. And I did. I felt a change. More hope entered in. (“It’s all gonna be fine!”) I felt more grateful for the help I failed to fully appreciate just moments ago.</p>
<p>We get into moods. And bad moods are hard to get out of. But this is life. Life is full of bad moods.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-do-you-do-to-fix-your-bad-mood" class="level1">
<h1>What do you do to fix your bad mood?</h1>
<p>This quote came to mind while I was praying:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As you think celestial, you will find yourself avoiding anything that robs you of your agency. Any addiction—be it gaming, gambling, debt, drugs, alcohol, anger, pornography, sex, or even food﻿—offends God. Why? <strong>Because your obsession becomes your god. You look to it rather than to Him for solace.</strong><br>
<a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-think-celestial">“Think Celestial!”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t need an addiction to appreciate the sentiment here: where do you turn when you’re struggling?</p>
<p>Do you turn to social media? Phone calls? News? The internet? TV? Anger? Food?</p>
<p>I’ve tried all those things. They’re all wonderful (except anger lol), especially calling a friend. But am I doing that before taking the issue to the Lord?</p>
<p>He has invited us to take all things to Him. Every thought even:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Look unto me in <strong><em>every</em></strong> thought; doubt not, fear not.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-6.36">Doctrine and Covenants 6.36</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we take all things to Him so He can consecrate them to us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ye must <strong>not perform any thing</strong> unto the Lord <strong>save in the first place ye shall pray</strong> unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9">2 Nephi 32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Lord blesses us even when we don’t pray. But the promise is in the prayer: pray in all things. Pray in every thought. Do all things for Good reasons.</p>
<p>And he didn’t qualify what “labor” means here:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Come unto me, <strong>all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</strong> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30">Matthew 11.28–30</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps He wants us to decide what our labor is, bring it to Him, and consecrate it and ask His help. This seems aligned with Him wanting us to be agents:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.28">Doctrine and Covenants 58.28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This comes after “Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;” <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.27">Doctrine and Covenants 58.27</a>)</p>
</section>
<section id="let-god-prevail" class="level1">
<h1>Let God Prevail</h1>
<p>So: get an idea of some good cause to be engaged in (parenting, providing for family, etc), pray for support in it, ask Him to consecrate it, watch for miracles.</p>
<p>I think we find reasons for why we <em>shouldn’t</em> pray.<sup>1</sup> Because we think we need to do it on our own. There’s a constant balance between “how much do I rely on God and how much should I just get up and do it myself”. I think the balance is rather not a balance at all. Just pick a plan, ask for help, then go and do what’s in your power. The scriptures are full of examples of people who did this.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>He loves us. He wants us to succeed. He cares about our daily labor, whether that’s in a field or in the barn that a home turns into. If you’re still wondering, <a href="https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/the-simple-miracle-that-helped-the-whitmers-further-the-book-of-mormon">Read this cool story on David Whitmer and how the Lord helped him with his crops</a> and how the Lord is aware of all our needs, temporal and spiritual.</p>
<p>I got up from my prayer feeling “I can do this!” And the impression came “<em>we</em> can do this”.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 11 - Angel shows signs to Nephi</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-11-seeing-signs-of-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Nephi saw a vision because he desired knowledge. Consider the Angel’s instruction:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>7 And behold this thing <strong>shall be given unto thee for a sign</strong>, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-11.7">1 Nephi 11.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we know that the Lord rebuked the Pharisees for seeking signs:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but <strong>can ye not discern the signs of the times?</strong> A <strong>wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign</strong>; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. <a href="../scriptures/matthew-16.1-4">Matthew 16.1–4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But signs themselves are good. Moses lead by signs: the seven miracles. Baal was trumped by a sign: fire from heaven. Manna in the wilderness. Water from the rock. The fall of the city from trumpets. Oil in the vial.</p>
<p>Any miracle is a sign. A sign that God exists. That He has all power. That Christ is His son.</p>
<p>But today we don’t need to seek for <em>new</em> signs but instead do as the Lord said and “discern the signs of the times”.</p>
<p>By seeking to see His hand, we find the signs.</p>
<p>It’s wicked to seek for a sign, because wicked means “unrepentant”. An unrepentant soul, one who is not going to Heavenly Father and seeking His love, doesn’t see the Hand of God in their life. As a result, they are without his signs (<a href="../concepts/gratus-sum-ergo-habeo.html">Gratus sum, ergo habeo</a>).</p>
<p>So to see signs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Repent (desire a connection with Heavenly Father and His son)</li>
<li>Look for them (discern)</li>
</ol>
<p>Presto poof.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Early Morning Workouts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/early-morning-workouts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I played football when in middle and high school. Part of the high school routine was early morning summer workouts.</p>
<p>6:30 am is brutal for a 16 year old kid. But getting up, going to the school to run some sprints, get a lift in, and get home by 8 to shower and go back to sleep was always a great feeling.</p>
<p>I’m grateful that to this day I still value exercise. I know the benefits it gives me. I also know how to lift properly so I don’t hurt myself. I also have muscle/ligament memory where it’s easier to pick up after 6months of not exercising compared to someone starting from scratch. (Maybe that’s not a scientific thing, but I feel like it is 😂).</p>
<p>I’m slightly less grateful that my 16 year old self could bench more than I’ll ever again be able to bench, and run more than I’ll ever again have time to run, but perhaps I’m grateful I can challenge myself to surpass my teenage years.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>These chapters teach me:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to overcome adversity (prayer)</li>
<li>Some people never change (Laman and Lemuel)</li>
<li>People who don’t like the message usually reject it and denounce it (Laman and Lemuel)</li>
<li>The love of God is accessible to all</li>
<li>The Lord invites all, even if He knows they won’t listen</li>
<li>Those who come can fully appreciate the beauty of the Lord’s love</li>
<li>If you take your eyes off the Savior, and care what people think instead, you can feel shame which can drive you to leave Him</li>
<li>The scriptures are written with a specific purpose: they don’t know. They’re doing what the Lord wants them to do.</li>
<li>The Lord will teach those about the Tree of Life who want to know about it. Nephi wasn’t any more special than anyone else. He just wanted to know.</li>
<li>The Lord works through prophets. Through the priesthood.</li>
<li>Perhaps Lehi could have been more gentle with Laman and Lemuel. But Nephi <em>did</em> mention the “tender feelings” that Lehi had for them, so maybe Laman and Lemuel just didn’t get it</li>
<li>There’s a little bit of Laman and Lemuel and Nephi and Sam and Lehi and Sariah in all of us.</li>
<li>Over time, the prophecies are revealed and fulfilled.</li>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Similarities</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/similarities.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything truly unique about any one individual? At the very least, any two people probably have eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose. They probably have brain and a heart. Probably have fingers and toes.</p>
<p>Probably have feelings. Experience love. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Resentment. Joy. Elation. Fear. Anxiety. Doubt. Faith. Fulfillment. Hope.</p>
<p>The reason why they feel these things will certainly be unique to them, but likely follow the themes of family, friends, food, shelter, fulfillment, etc.</p>
<p>I learned after being in Honduras for 6 weeks just how different I was from people across the world.</p>
<p>6 months later I learned (over time) just how deeply similar they are.</p>
<p>After 2 years I came home and deeply missed Honduras. I felt alone and lost in this American world.</p>
<p>Now I’m somewhere in between. But the point is: I’m grateful that humans can connect at a deeply human level no matter who they are or where they’re from.</p>

<p>2024-01-21 - “Attend to it” - Joseph Senior supported Joseph. The Angel wanted Joseph to know this. - David’s field being ploughed overnight - a few items were left for David - the Lord did just enough. Also, the Lord honored the man’s request and didn’t disrespect him. The man got what he wanted, David did some more work, and the unnecessary part was finished by whomever. - Joseph’s trouble was being heavily persecuted physically. Like the Israelites. Now, physical persecution has mostly stopped and instead it’s just verbal assaults at “the church” from press and random voices on social media. The challenge of our day is to remain faithful.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 8 - Press Forward Continually</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/choosing-to-press-forward.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Obtaining the love of Christ is not easy:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-8.24">1 Nephi 8.24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, He loves us unconditionally. But it is up to us to come to Him.</p>
<p>He constantly invites us to come to Him, and because He gives us agency (<a href="../christianity/stop-trying-to-change-people.html">Stop trying to change people. Stop it.</a>), we have to choose to follow Him.</p>
<p>This choice isn’t an easy one. It’s a difficult one. Some of us get tired and let go. Or we get distracted by all there is around us. Whatever the case - God’s love for us is constant. It’s there. It’s available. It’s at the tree. It’s felt through meaningful prayer (<a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a>). It’s felt through studying His words. It’s by building a relationship that we come to Him. It’s hard work, but it’s the way we experience the delicious fruit.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Social Gatherings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/social-gatherings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week I went to a tiny venue concert. The person who invited me said, “Can you believe that just two years ago we were forbidden to gather like this?”</p>
<p>We were listening to a Honky Tonk/Rockability Banjo jammer who just absolutely slayed the whole night. The energy was off the charts. Everyone was dancing and having a great time.</p>
<p>I’m glad and grateful we can get together again.</p>

This is greater incentive than any criticism - What do they want? (Not what do I want?) “smoking will keep you from making the bball team” - Ford: put yourself in their position. Consider it. And consider your own - Consider how they’ll receive your email. They have a ton of problems. They’re overwhelmed. Don’t sell them. Teach them the benefits they’ll get. - Flattery vs appreciation - flattery is lip service. If you’re trying to convince someone to do something and you’re using flattery, then thats manipulation. And you’re prone to get angry if they don’t want to do it (kids). But if you’re sincere, you’ll find a solution - Arouse in others an eager want - Don’t tell someone an idea. Plant the seed and make them think it’s their own.</p>
<p>2024-01-20 - 85% of success is in non-technical skills. Communication. - We grow far faster by rewarding good behavior than punishing bad behavior - Kids. - Futility of criticism - Ask questions. “Does your hard hat not fit properly? It will save you.” - Don’t kick a beehive if you want honey - “I don’t see how I could have done any better” - Criticism - Abraham Lincoln never sent the letter -</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Baby Formula</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/baby-formula.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Baby formula is a miracle. According to the internet, without it, people would either use cows milk, goats milk, etc and mix it with water and honey.</p>
<p>The fact that people can go to the store and buy food to feed their infant is a miracle. It’s one of the things that has reduced infant mortality.</p>

<p>I was reading the wrong book. I read <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> when my friends recommended <em>this</em> one instead.</p>
<p>I already like this one better. It lays things out better i feel. More chronological. But perhaps it’s because he has more time to write it.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/dymer_2206_librivox">Dymer : C. S. Lewis : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p>
<p>Knowing CS was in the war and had some relationship with Moore is fascinating.</p>

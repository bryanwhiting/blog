  <title>I’m Grateful for Ice Skating</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ice-skating.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I went ice skating. It was great.</p>
<p>I remembered a video about this old guy that wakes up at 5am or something and goes out and waters the ice rink. He fills up a few tubs of his own hot water and just treks over to the public park to fill up the rink. He uses his own homemade zamboni and what not.</p>
<p>There are good people in this world.</p>
<p>What’s cool about an ice rink is I don’t think about it for 364 days a year. But it’s there when I want to go. So that means enough people love it to keep it in business, and I can go only when I want to (once a year). Thats a cool thing too: collective community makes so many things possible, like downtown restaurants and museums - places that if they relied just on me they’d never last. But the community keeps them afloat (pun?).</p>
<p>I tried finding it, but this is the closest thing I could find. Just imagine this very old guy out there shlepping 55 gallon drums of water.</p>

<p>I found it!</p>

<p>It’s just become a way of life. If I don’t do the rink I don’t feel right.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 5 - Will a promise be delivered?</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-5-trusting-a-promise.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Lehi and his wife Sariah are at base camp while their boys are trying to get the plates (ancient record/scriptures) from a ruthless Laban. Sariah gets very nervous (v1-3), perhaps thinking they’ve been killed.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-weary-wanderer-waiting.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Waiting in the wilderness</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Then once she sees them come back (mission accomplished) she rejoices:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.8">1 Nephi 5.8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what if they hadn’t come back? Is this just confirmation bias?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See, Sariah had been promised her sons safe return:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5">1 Nephi 5.5</a> (Lehi talking)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of this (a specific promise), we often fixate in contrary to the exact thing we should be expecting.</p>
<p>Consider Adam and Eve: don’t eat that one tree. Eat anything else. Everything else. Just not that one. → which one?<sup>1</sup> this one? Oh, we ate it.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;im being funny here, because there’s a lot more to the Adam and Eve story - they were supposed to eat it. Point is: we focus on what we’re told not to do.</p></li></div><p>Perhaps Sariah fixates on her sons not returning because that is what a prophet promised her.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there must be a space in time between when a promise is made and a promise is delivered (<a href="../scriptures/alma-40.6-9">see Alma 40.6–9</a> for similar logic). We are not told the length of that in between time. Could be today. Could be tomorrow. Who knows how long Sariah was waiting.</p>
<p>An interesting corollary: she wasn’t doubting something she <em>wasn’t</em> promised.</p>
<p>Consider all the promises in the scriptures. Abraham is promised the gospel will be in his seed. Nephi is promised his seed will be destroyed (he was the righteous one) and Laman and Lemuel were implicitly promised their seed would remain (even though they were wicked). Joseph of Egypt promised some things, Enos is promised other things, etc. We’re all unique.</p>
<p>Let’s consider Peter and John. The Lord offered them whatever they wanted. John wanted to tarry on earth and Peter wanted to be done with the earth and go to heaven. Peter seems to have gotten tiffed with John because John one-upped Peter on the righteous desires contest with Jesus as the Judge:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-7.4">Doctrine and Covenants 7.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The savior goes on to explain how both Peter and John’s desires were great.<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;side note: the Lord doesn’t compare Peter against John. He just says “John wanted to do more than what <em>he</em> has previously done.” “I say unto thee, Peter, this was a good desire; but my beloved has desired that he might do more, or a greater work yet among men than what he has before done. Yea, he has undertaken a greater work; therefore I will make him as flaming fire and a ministering angel; he shall minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation who dwell on the earth.” <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-7.5-6">Doctrine and Covenants 7.5–6</a></p></li></div><p>Back to Sariah - here are three ways we tend to worry:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>we can worry about things promised to us. We’re just rarely promised a timeline. Trust. Wait. And see.</li>
<li>Where we aren’t promised anything, we have nothing to think of or worry about.</li>
<li>We may individually be promised different things. The path of everyone is unique.</li>
</ol>
<p>But we’re all promised eternal life if we follow the Lord (eternal happiness):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Verily I say unto you, ye shall both have according to your desires, for ye both joy in that which ye have desired. <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-7.8">Doctrine and Covenants 7.8</a></p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Heaven</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/heaven.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m not sure what I would do if I didn’t have a concept of Heaven in my mind. It yields so very many benefits for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives me hope for when family members pass</li>
<li>Reminds me why life matters: I can only take with me my relationships.</li>
<li>Heaven is about people, not money. Reminds me what matters <em>in</em> life and what will bring me happiness.</li>
<li>Gives me purpose as I raise my family.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a sense that heaven is more like a peaceful home than a luxurious resort. Physical amenities don’t yield joy. True pleasure and enduring happiness in life come from inner peace.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">My heavenly home would probably be more spruced up, but this is pretty peaceful.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As a concept alone, it guides you to make better decisions by living long term: death is only a door to the beyond. Even if I assume that heaven is a farce, still believing in it yields so much good for one’s life. But thankfully it’s not just some notion. It’s a real place. I’m grateful the Lord created the heavens.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-4.9">Mosiah 4.9</a></p>

  <title>A Church Culture of Missionary work</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/sacrament-talk-on-missionary-work.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A friend gave a talk in church about missionary work, which is the Lord’s invitation to share His gospel and good news with the world. Having been a missionary for two years, it’s much less about “effective sales” strategies and much more about trying to live like a good person and invite others to enjoy the benefits of following Christ.</p>
<p>I bring up the point about sales because a lot of people outside of the church can see LDS missionaries as salespeople. To one degree, they are: they’re trying to change people’s belief system. Adopt Christianity. <sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;From the ultra cynical: “they just want more tithing!” But, like, if you think about it this argument doesn’t work in so many ways. Mainly that the missionaries are paying to be there (don’t get any tithing) and most of tithing goes to maintaining the church (buildings, books, temples, missions, etc).</p></li></div><p>Yea, that’s certainly a reasonable way to look at it from one angle. But the reality is more like “I have something that’s great and I want other people to benefit from it the same way I benefit from it”. Or better said: there’s so much…misinformation about my church and Christianity in general, how do I have a productive conversation with you about it without knowing where you are? I’d love to talk to you about it, but are you deeply inwardly vehemently against it for some obtuse reason I’m not aware of? That’s what provoked some fear in sharing His good news.</p>
<p>But these fears aren’t warranted. Because that isn’t the right focus from my end. The best focus for “missionary work” is: if I have something that’s great in my life, I should share it like anything else great in my life.</p>
<p>Did I see a good movie over the weekend? Great, share it. Did i hear a great talk on Sunday at church? Great, share it. Did I have a good hike? Awesome, share it. Did I have a funny experience while teaching some kids on Sunday? Yea, dope. Share it.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Mind if I drink this? Oh, you’d like some? I didn’t want to offend you by offering but sure I’d love to share - Elder Uchtdorf analogy paraphrased</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<hr>
<p>Things I liked from my friends talk:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Over the past several months, (my wife) and I have implemented a new fad into our lives in an attempt to improve our well-being, which is the practice of cold plunging. Some of you may have heard of this trend as many gurus talk about it on social media because of its benefits, such as reducing stress and mood enhancement. Cold plunging is submerging your body in very cold water (typically around 50 degrees) for a period of 3 to 6 minutes. Sounds absolutely terrible, right? Well, it is terrible! No matter how many times we do it, it is still very hard and very uncomfortable. Nonetheless, we continue to do it, almost every day, because of the way it makes us feel afterwards. Immediately after getting out of the water I feel alert, energized and confident I can tackle the tasks of the day. Sitting in that cold water is always uncomfortable, but the discomfort is always worth it. <strong>By having felt what’s on the other side, I can get comfortable with the uncomfortable.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cold plunge analogy is interesting: because it’s always hard. Always intimidating. I think that’s true in my personal experience. But for me it’s more like… the opposite of hyperextending my knee.</p>
<p>When I was in high school I got a knee injury. I hyperextended it. The first time was incredibly painful. I was out a few days. But then I came back and was fine-ish. Then a few weeks later I did it again. Then a few days later: again. By the end of the season, I was hyperextending it every other day. It was bad news. A few weeks after the season ended I was playing in a bball tournament and again big hyperextending.</p>
<p>I stopped playing sports that summer and let myself heal up. Haven’t had problems since.</p>
<p>Same with sharing the gospel, but the opposite. At first it’s really intimidating. You do it once and you realize it’s not that bad. Then the more you do it the more it becomes part of your day.</p>
<p>Kinda like writing in this blog. At first I’m trying to find my voice. Now I don’t care and just want to write. I hope it’s beneficial for you.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On the other hand, some may be thinking none of those sound any easier and maybe you sometimes feel that you aren’t contributing because missionary work is generally intimidating and uncomfortable to you. That is OKAY. <strong>All efforts, no matter how small, are important and impactful.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminded me of <a href="../concepts/president-russel-m-nelson.html">President Russel M. Nelson</a>’s invitation:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Anytime you do anything that helps anyone—on either side of the veil﻿—take a step toward making covenants with God and receiving their essential baptismal and temple ordinances, you are helping to gather Israel. It is as simple as that. <a href="../scriptures/hope-of-israel">Hope of Israel</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As a missionary in (Some Area) I had one mission president for my first year and another for my second year. Both presidents elevated the success of the mission with different approaches and leadership styles. In my first year under my first mission president, the mission accomplished a big goal of doubling the number of baptisms from the previous year. During this time our mission president wasn’t fond of us spending too much time with members and our success came from focusing on other areas of the work. By contrast, my second mission president changed the culture and encouraged us to spend as much time with the members as we could, even if we did not have someone to teach with the members. He taught us to focus on the number of lessons with a member participating as the most important key indicator. As a result, the mission’s baptisms started to skyrocket and the number more than doubled again. I know that our success can be attributed to us striving to have as many members as possible participating in our lessons and our emphasis on members and missionaries working together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your note a member of the church you may balk at “baptism skyrocketing”. It kinda gives a cultish vibe if that’s how you see it - our goal is to baptize everyone!! I get it. Not great language from the outsider’s perspective <em>if</em> that’s how you see it.</p>
<p>Having been a member of the church my whole life, I’ve heard this rhetoric a lot - get baptisms. But I think this is more of a sociological misrepresentation of a deeply inward desire to share what’s good in your life with others.</p>
<p>Do I want to baptize the world? Umm…do I want everyone to have world peace? Yea.</p>
<p>Will baptizing someone give them peace? No.&nbsp;Well, not <em>just</em> dunking yourself in a hot-tub sized mini pool.</p>
<p>Will someone who has a sincere desire to follow Christ the rest of their life benefit from being baptized because it gives them a chance to publicly commit to following Christ and thus be supported by a community of like-minded people also trying to self-improve constantly? Yea. Baptism would be great here.</p>
<p>Do I want to baptize everyone? No.&nbsp;I <em>would</em> love it if everyone desired to follow Jesus a little more in their life. Learn a little more about him. So, yea I want everyone to be baptized.</p>
<p>This is the spirit which my friend is describing.</p>
<p>So doubling baptisms is this notion of a very fascinating cultural experience: we have as a church more success in helping other people discover the joy of following Christ by <em>how</em> we package “the message”. Yea, it’s sales at some level. What’s a better strategy? Cold calling or referrals? Always referrals. There’s trust there. The product doesn’t seem as strange. Likewise, it takes a lot to change a set of religious beliefs. Having seen someone you know and enjoy associating with benefit from the religion helps make it more palatable at first to begin discussions.</p>
<p>Lastly, this strategy is fascinating: focus on teaching people who already believe in God about <em>why</em> they believe in God, or more about His story. These refreshers help enliven the mind, no different than perhaps me going back to some Stat 121 material and just really appreciating its elegance (even though I do more advanced math in my day to day). Teach people the basics and they’ll remember what they love about it.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 4 - Why not?</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-4-why-not.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Nephi asks a faith-opening question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>for behold he is mightier than all the earth, <strong>then why not mightier than</strong> Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands? <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-4.1">1 Nephi 4.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in <a href="../christianity/unknown-god.html">An Unknown God</a>, Nephi demonstrates the ability to find a way with his questioning. Instead of asking doubtfully, he asks faithfully.</p>
<p>It reminds me of Enoch:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>31 And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord, saying: <strong>Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight</strong>, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant? 32 And the Lord said unto Enoch: <strong>Go forth and do</strong> as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. <a href="../scriptures/moses-6.31-32">Moses 6.31–32</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord didn’t tell him why he was chosen. He just said “go forth”.</p>
<p>The Lord’s thoughts are above our thoughts. Too often we put limiting beliefs on ourselves - I’m not good enough, why me? Or, why would God want to help me?</p>
<p>Why not instead ask, “why <em>wouldn’t</em> Heavenly Father want to help me? He loves me and has promised he <em>would</em> help me.”</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Angels want to help</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I love this quote by Jared after just going through something really hard:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that Jared spake again unto his brother, saying: Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go. <strong>And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is choice above all the earth?</strong> And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our inheritance. <a href="../scriptures/ether-1.38">Ether 1.38</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just lost your job? Who knoweth but the Lord will provide a better one? Just lost your house? Who knoweth but the Lord will give you a promised land? (They had lost their jobs and house and were wandering at this point.) I love the optimism here.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 3 - Dreamed a Dream</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-3-dreamed-a-dream.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A great quote leading up to MLK Jr day:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Behold I have dreamed a dream <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-3.2">1 Nephi 3.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lehi dreamed many dreams. It got him in trouble with his boys, as Laman and Lemuel “did murmur in many things against their father, <strong>because he was a visionary man</strong>” (<a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.11">1 Nephi 2.11</a>).</p>
<p>Lehi’s wife, Sariah, also murmured against him, “she also had complained against my father, <strong>telling him that he was a visionary man;</strong> saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.” (<a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.2">1 Nephi 5.2</a>)</p>
<p>Lehi’s response to this is great:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I <strong>know that I am a visionary man</strong>; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren. But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.4-5">1 Nephi 5.4–5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This response teaches me a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>when people struggle, they can complain against a good thing and make it a bad thing. “Why do you always have to be such a goodie two shoes?”</li>
<li>The response is “if I weren’t such a goodie two shoes I’d be miserable”. Helps remind people of the value of their own biases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complaining is a natural part of life. Just be careful what you complain about.</p>

  <title>You can plan your life in 5 minutes</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/you-can-plan-your-life-in-5-minutes.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It doesn’t take 30 years to plan a good life. It’s actually quite simple and if you sit down for 5 minutes you can figure out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do you like where you’re at? Heading? No? Where do you want to go? Why? What do you need to change to get there?</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>No fancy grand vision. No elaborate planning. Just maybe 15 minutes to plan ahead.</p>
<p>The speed of planning is 0.01% of the effort required to execute. “We’re going to the moon by the end of the decade”. Plan. Done. Execution is hard.</p>
<p>Ideas are fleeting. Plans are changeable. Plans and ideas aren’t the IP of your company. It’s the people and the execution. Thats the hard part.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for My Childhood</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/my-childhood.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I won the childhood lottery. I had good parents, good siblings, good friends, and luckily made a few good choices.</p>
<p>That’s all it takes: a few good choices. I credit my parents for giving me a good home to grow up in, a good religion to teach me good principles, and a lot of support.</p>
<p>As I grow older, time reveals itself. The dust under the childhood cushion is now identified. As I raise my own children I wonder: how did they do it?</p>
<p>Which perhaps is what my children will ask me someday.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Childhood is playing</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I’m grateful I played a lot.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for parents who take up the challenge to raise the next generation. I’m grateful for siblings to live, love, and learn from. For friends who make the journey an adventure, and for a family that I can always come back to.</p>

  <title>Junk attracts Junk</title>

<p>Ever throw the shoes <em>by</em> the shoe rack? Or leave <em>one</em> dish in the sink? You know what happens: an avalanche.</p>

<p>Badly formatted code attracts more badly formatted code.</p>
<p>But the same is for good: a clean floor makes you want to keep it clean.</p>
<p>So what explains the fulcrum - where is the balance between accepting dire straights vs pushing for perfection? We oscillate between these worlds as our attention wanders.</p>
<p>I’m guessing the fulcrum is based on incentives. Guests coming over? Clean up the house. Boss reviewing? Clean the code.</p>

  <title>Biden’s debt relief won’t relieve what he thinks it will</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/bidens-debt-relief-wont-relieve-what-he-thinks-it-will.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/the-quest-for-cosmic-justice.html">The Quest for Cosmic Justice</a>, Sowell points out repeatedly how policies focused on helping a target demographic may not only hinder them, but those around them too. Policies are for politicians to pursue power, to win the next vote.</p>
<p>What good does relieving <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-9-billion-student-debt-relief">130bn</a> in university debt do?</p>
<p>the argument is that our system is broken. So we’ll fix it with money.</p>
<p>The more flawed thinking is that “education is a right.” Should this be true, then food is a right. Then social media is a right. Our phones are a right.</p>
<p>Life is a right. Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, too.</p>
<p>But my decision to go 200k in debt for an investment that didn’t return dividends (hence my inability to pay), is not a right. It’s a poor investment choice.</p>
<p>Sending out money signals a poor precedence, apart from the blatant desire to buy votes. The economics aren’t aligned. The incentives are bad.</p>
<p>“Go learn about something, investing 4 years, and discover it’s not capable of helping you earn wages” is nothing more than a sabbatical.</p>
<p>We need to spend that money incentivizing innovation. Entrepreneurs. People who create value.</p>
<p>The “educated” masses (3.6m) who cannot afford to pay their debt, when they scoffed at tradespeople who were employable the moment they finished their 3 week training, and then asked those tradespeople to pay for their schooling, is disappointing.</p>
<p>We need to think about incentives, both long and short term.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">At some level the government stole from the uneducated to pay for the unemployable ‘educated’</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The solution: student loan officers should be on the hook to ask “what is your potential income return?” The loan must be payable within 8 years at a 10% additional tax on their wages. They need to be able to survive with this 10% tax, and the 10% tax over 8 years should be sufficient to pay the bills.</p>
<p>So if you have a $100k job, that’s $80k education. 10% tax for 8 years is 10k per year to pay the debt.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Strollers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/strollers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Plop them in, buckle them up. Go on a run, give them a cup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strollers are how I take my kids to school every day. I strap them in (or they just sit down), and I hop on my Onewheel and we go on a ride.</p>
<p>10 m.p.h., the wind in our hair, the cars waiting behind us because we’re fast enough and wide enough that they can’t pass us. All of this is good.</p>
<p>My kids get to see more of the world faster, even if that world is just here to school. My non-school kids can get out for a minute without a huge hassle on my part.</p>
<p>The best part is: the stroller rolls. I don’t have to drag it. I don’t have to slog it. It’s not a 50lb brick. It’s got wheels. The marvelous creation of the near frictionless geometric phenomena that is a wheel.</p>
<p>So I guess I’m also grateful for wheels and chariots. Thank you to whomever invented these things thousands of years ago.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-2-receiving-a-promised-land.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>While Lehi wandered in the wilderness, Nephi recounted he left the “land of his inheritance”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.4">1 Nephi 2.4</a></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-leaving-the-promised-land.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Leaving the promised land</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Yet by the end of the Chapter, Nephi is promised a land of inheritance:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.20">1 Nephi 2.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing how they lose one thing but gain another. Also amazing is how they had prophets warning them of Jerusalem’s destruction - why didn’t the Lord make <em>those</em> prophets leave?</p>
<p>He has a plan for us individually.</p>
<p>CS Lewis remarked something along the lines of “We don’t chase God, God chases us”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Both Malcolm Muggeridge and C.S. Lewis attest to this. Muggeridge wrote, “I had a notion that somehow, besides questing, I was being pursued.” Lewis said that, “…night after night…I sensed the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. Finally, I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed…” (<a href="https://www.stettlerindependent.com/community/man-can-not-sidestep-thinking-about-god-faith-and-reflection-6606319">link</a>, also discussed in <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a>) (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/681434-you-must-picture-me-alone-in-that-room-in-magdalen">good reads link</a>)</p>

<p>Kid screaming? why?</p>
<p>Milk on the floor? why is that a funny thing?</p>
<p>Poop on the ground? (<a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a>) It won’t last. it’s endearing.</p>
<p>No, this isn’t just fanciful thinking - this is a choice. You’ve chosen to be angry at that spilled milk, lost your cool when bro slapped sis, and walked out of the room when you heard that last cry for “more breakfast!!”.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> did you get overwhelmed? Stressed about all there is to do, and now there’s one more thing? Stressed about “am i a good parent”? Stressed about raising your kids right and you have to instruct them on everything they do wrong in order to do that?</p>
<p>My new philosophy: Kids are kids. They’re optimizers. Anyone in tech knows that an optimizer is a thing trying to find the optimal point of another thing. It’s like battleships - you keep guessing until you find. Then you guess around until you get all the points, until you know where to look.</p>
<p>Kids do this all day. They say something crazy trying to get a reaction. They say a not-funny joke 100 times until it’s funny again. Humans do that too.</p>
<p>So they’re optimizing. Exploring. Exploiting. That’s all their doing - exploring the space, exploiting the emotional signal.</p>
<p>Knowing that, find the fun in the moment. They won’t always be like this. And when it’s gone, you’ll wish it wasn’t. <a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a></p>

<ul>
<li>cosmic justice - principle of equity</li>
<li>People who want equality will end up destroying it - Milton Friedman’s. They’ll be consumed by their power.</li>
<li>We must consider the costs given the world we live in now. We cannot recreate the world from scratch.</li>
<li>“Through no fault of their own”</li>
<li>4/5 of millionaires are self made</li>
<li>Problems stated in 1960</li>
<li>Envy = social justice</li>
<li>Imposing any constraint creates other costs.</li>
<li>power. Politicians like promoting ideas so they can get elected.</li>
</ul>

  <title>Cool Quarto Site</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Quarto lists a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/">gallery</a> of things you can do with it.</p>
<p>This post illustrates</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How you can array your blog</li>
<li>How you can collect subscribers with just google form</li>
<li>How you can iframe other apps, such as from huggingface.</li>
</ol>
<p>I came across this site: <a href="https://forbo7.github.io/" class="uri">https://forbo7.github.io/</a>. I enjoyed seeing how they arrayed their blogs, which I had never seen before - they used grids.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/quarto-demo-forbo7-landing.png" class="preview-image img-fluid"></p>
<p>They use an embedded google form for subscriptions:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/screenshot-quarto-demo-forbo7-subscribe.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And they have an<a href="https://forbo7.github.io/web_apps/apps/flood_detector.html">iframe on a Huggingface</a> app to show something cool:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/quarto-demo-forbo7-huggingface.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That’s all.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 1 - He prepares us to teach us</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-Nephi-1-he-prepares-us-to-teach-us.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Consider this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen. And being <strong>thus</strong> overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.7-8">1 Nephi 1.7–8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cause and effect. First: he was overcome by the spirit. Second, he had a vision.</p>
<p>But that’s not how the vision came. First, it began with prayer.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.5-6">1 Nephi 1.5–6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here’s the order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lehi listens to prophets that Jerusalem will be destroyed (4)</li>
<li>Lehi prays for his people, hoping they won’t be (5)</li>
<li>Lehi sees a pillar of fire, sees many things (6)</li>
<li>Lehi returns home (assumes he’s not home), and is overcome with what he saw (7)</li>
<li>Lehi then has another, more pronounced vision (8)</li>
</ol>
<p>What a way to start off the Book of Mormon: this is a book about personal revelation, written by people who had revelations, and it teaches us the pattern. In this case, we care about others. When we do, the heavens open as we pray.</p>
<p>We prob won’t have visions, but we <em>will</em> have the spirit.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for <strong>unto him that receiveth I will give more</strong> <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-28.30">2 Nephi 28.30</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>What’s your decision framework?</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/whats-your-decision-framework.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Annie Duke asks the question “how do you make decisions? What’s your framework?” (<a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a>)</p>
<p>She remarks that many people don’t have one. Many CEO’s just go off their gut.</p>
<p>I encountered this in my investing days (ahem, internship). I lead a discussion on a paper I had read about how emotions affect our judgment and investment decisions.</p>
<p>I proposed an idea: that the investors should make a spreadsheet with labels on their feelings for that decision. They can use this as further information later on when evaluating their buy/sell/holding decisions.</p>
<p>I was laughed out of the room.</p>
<p>“Hey! Why don’t we all get some mood rings?!” Well, that guy (the boss) was later fired, but that’s not the point.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Point is: if you think you’re making decisions independent of your emotions, you’re incredibly mistaken. Judgment is based off reason and gut. Decisions usually rely on gut though. You have to “feel good”.</p>
<p>I had seen this boss make many decisions without explaining his thinking. “Hold.” Why? The company is tanking per reports. “Sell”, but this one’s looking good!</p>
<p>The point is nobody could replicate his decision making. Half the time it felt arbitrary.</p>
<p>Only later did I learn that one of the most famous investment company, Bridgewater Capital, does this very thing. It’s not for everybody, nor do I do it, but I think it’s a good idea 😄. # proposal</p>
<p>Make a spreadsheet for your decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What to decide</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Decision: what you chose</li>
<li>Rationale: why you chose it</li>
<li>Facts: supporting facts</li>
<li>Emotional Reasoning: how you “felt” about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do this for all decisions: even the “hold” decisions (maintain status quo). Because decision to not change course is a decision in and of itself.</p>

  <title>Organization and Minimalism</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/organization-and-minimalism.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It’s hard to be a minimalist as a parent. Or as…a human…in this economy. We all want more stuff.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-bear-with-messy-stuff.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">When in doubt, toss it out</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>With a small living space and a growing family I’ve grown accustomed to throwing stuff out. I grew up in a bigger house than I have now so there was space for everything. Now there’s space for very little. It’s actually a great feeling because I know what’s in every box (after doing some deep cleaning over winter break).</p>
<p>I remember helping a friend move in high school. Endless hoards of products, products, products. Three moving trucks. Why? I wondered.</p>
<p>My philosophy now is: RAM and Hard drive.</p>
<p>RAM: the random access memory. The things you see when you open doors affect your brain state. Your brain can only hold so much. If you live in clutter you have clutter. So the things you see in your house should reflect what you can hold in memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toys should have a theme (blocks, action figures, doll house). If it doesn’t match a theme, it’s gone (begone random slap bracelet! “Afuera!!!”, (quote from new Argentine President))</li>
<li>Things you see should be things you use. Don’t use flower every day? Don’t have it in the pantry. Put it in the corner thing. Cereal every day? Put that front and center.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then long-storage is the hard drive. It’s about keeping stuff you know you’ll want. This is easier to say than do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holiday decoration? (Theme) keep those in the attic, out of sight out of mind. But when you need it you know where it is.</li>
<li>You get the point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same goes for code. Maintenance and search cost increase as you add garbage. When it doubt, delete code. Afuera!!</p>
<p>When in doubt, “afuera!!”</p>

  <title>Reading Ethos</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/lists/reading-ethos.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>2024-01-09</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the book one hour. if it’s not great, then move on.
<ul>
<li>Aim to finish 30% of all books started? (Debating this.)</li>
<li>There are a million books and a million recommendations.</li>
<li>Not all books are worth the time though. Perhaps I’ve already learned that lesson. Perhaps it’s just not enjoyable, or I don’t like the author’s style. In these moments I wonder: what does this book being popular tell me about society? (There’s always something to be learned.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The good <em>stuff</em> sticks.
<ul>
<li>Note taking is interesting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fiction is more powerful for philosophy than anything
<ul>
<li>putting philosophy next to characters living it is better than just listening to <a href="../book-review/socrates-a-life-worth-living.html">“Socrates A Life Worth Living” by Devra Lehman</a> and hearing back and forth arguments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read things I’m not interested in
<ul>
<li>the best book on cooking. The best book on nascar, etc. I don’t need to be an expert in everything, but to pick a random field and get the best book in that field can open my mind up.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

  <title>Audiobooks</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/audiobooks.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I first discovered audiobooks it felt like a super power. I can listen while working out, while doing dishes, while folding laundry, etc. the possibilities! Then came Libby, the app that allows me to connect to my local library and do what?! Download audiobooks?! Yes plz.</p>
<p>In 2023 I got back into podcasts. Lots of All-in listening, a lot of Tim Ferris again, some Huberman, etc.</p>
<p>Despite fascinating interviews that tell the story of now, the benefit of a book is that it’s hundreds if not thousands of hours of mental preparation, editing, preparing. Why wouldn’t I want to read something that someone spent thousands of hours curating vs them just spitballing for 60m.</p>
<p>Some podcasts can tell a different story than you can get in a book, or tell the backstory, etc. but they’re usually on a podcast to get you to read the book!!</p>
<p>Thank you to the writers, and to all readers who give them an audience and a livelihood so they’ll keep writing.</p>

  <title>Scriptures within Scriptures</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/scriptures-within-scriptures.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-white-fruit-delicious-zoom-in.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The Scriptures are precious and worth our time</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Nephi recounts how they had obtained some scriptures:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And <strong>we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us</strong>, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.21">1 Nephi 5.21</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few things that stand out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>He thought about his children. In <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-25.26">2 Nephi 25.26</a> it’s mentioned “that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.”</li>
<li>They had the scriptures because they accomplished the task laid before them, “I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-3.7.html">1 Nephi 3.7</a></li>
<li>These scriptures were “desirable”. Know what else is desirable? The fruit of the tree of life:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-8.10">1 Nephi 8.10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, are precious to help our families know of Christ, have been obtained and written by those obedient to Christ, and are desirable and great to consume.</p>
<p>In <a href="../tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.html">A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media</a>, I talk about how tech workers talk of social media as “snackable content”. Frequently the word “consumption” is used to describe how app “users” “consume” content.</p>
<p>It’s mostly not the stuff worth consuming in great quantities. Don’t settle for snacks. Enjoy a feast:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, do not spend <strong>money</strong> for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and <strong>feast upon that which perisheth not</strong>, neither can be corrupted, and <strong>let your soul delight in fatness.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-9.51">2 Nephi 9.51</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Replace “money” with “time”.</em></p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the Toothbrush</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/toothbrush.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything more refreshing than brushing your teeth? Anything less satisfying than going to bed without brushing your teeth (camping, airplane ride?)?</p>
<p>Brushing my teeth is a gift. And I know it prevents problems (cavities, disease, etc). It also enables me to have more sugar, which is probably bad for me but I enjoy regardless.</p>
<p>In <a href="../book-review/the-power-of-habit.html">The Power of Habit</a> and learned about this great fact about tooth brushing (summarized by ChatGPT):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yes, “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg does mention toothpaste. The book discusses how toothpaste companies, particularly Pepsodent, leveraged the power of habit to increase their product’s usage. Duhigg explains how Pepsodent created a daily habit for people by associating the use of toothpaste with the tingling sensation it produces, which wasn’t common in toothpastes before Pepsodent. This case study is used to illustrate how cues and rewards can create lasting habits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pepsodent and their marketing team in the 1920’s changed life for us all. Same goes for body wash, hand soap, and other soaps - they put the bubbles in them to make us think it’s “working”.</p>
<p>But I also like bubbles. Who doesn’t like bubbles? Toothpaste has bubbles. What a gift.</p>

  <title>A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tim Ferris describes why he doesn’t have social media on his phone:</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fn-giKevmo?si=f1Lz9H2U08BQhKwv" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>I recently deleted social media from my phone 14 days ago. I had been using Instagram until April when I quit and Twitter all year. I realized within days how much better I felt without social media. Happier. Legitimately happier.</p>
<p>And why? What do I get out of it? I’m not growing closer to friends. That’s what texting and calling and spending time in person does. But I’d argue even texting doesn’t really strengthen a relationship because it’s so hard to properly interpret emotions and cues via text: you interpret them how you read those texts. You interpret it according to your emotional state, not the sender’s.</p>
<p>Phone provides vocal emotional cues. Body language another set of emotional cues. I can get probably 70% of this out from FaceTime or <a href="../gratitude/zoom.html">Zoom</a>. But being in person is what we’re meant for.</p>
<p>This is why we strengthen relationships locally, and fail to continue ones from high school or our previous job.</p>
<p>So what was I doing on social media? Watching clips of either strangers I don’t care about or college associates I friended (once lived locally with) that I no longer talk to.</p>
<p>So what’s the knife you’re bringing to the gun fight? When at YouTube I heard the CEO praise a team for increasing “seconds watched” by 15% by reducing the lag of the swipes between YouTube shorts (TikTok clone). The lag reduction was in the milliseconds. Your attention is being bought and manipulated by the shareholders of these companies.</p>

<p>They A/B test everything. This isn’t morally wrong. It’s actually quite human: we all A/B test everything every day. A joke here. A smile there. We put out feelers and see if we get a reaction. Don’t believe me? Ask my kid why he keeps throwing things in the toilet!</p>
<p>Billions of dollars and the brightest minds on earth are working at FAANG. Why? They need to provide for their families and academics doesn’t pay. Non-profits don’t pay. This isn’t immoral, it just is. There are very good people working there: honest, moral people. Some of the best I’ve seen in the industry. But when you get paid to maximize swipes, you maximize swipes. It’s just human nature. And some of them buy into the odd notions of “snackable content”, as if swiping for 30 minutes while on the toilet is what anyone wakes up excited to do. Keep on snacking…</p>
<p>Social media and Netflix provide a ton of value to the world in my opinion. I can use them to call anyone I want, raise money for a cause, or get likes on a cute pic of my cat (I don’t have a cat). I <em>do</em> see the value.</p>
<p>But the costs for me have outweighed the value.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> miss laughing about some random Reel. There’s nothing that can get you laughing faster than a 10 second clip paired with the right cuts and music and everything. The right meme just nails it in a way nothing else can. I miss seeing memes from my friends. But when all I do is send memes to these friends, is that a friendship?</p>
<p>Since being off social media I feel like my senses have grown. I now find my kids a lot funnier, my wife funnier, and I’m able to make heavy situations lighter much easier.</p>
<p>There’s a quote in <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> that’s something like “If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken”. I’d argue my other relationships weakened too. Time to leave the fight. I was losing.</p>

  <title>Becoming an expert is kind of a fallacy</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/becoming-an-expert.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just watched this clip:</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2ZK3ngNvvI?si=p4BCDVMWKBoc4KJQ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Important discussion points: as a novice you’re worried about where to go or picking the wrong thing.</p>
<p>I remember not taking an opportunity to learn C++ because “that’s not what I want to do”. In another occasion I wanted to learn PySpark over SQL because Python…</p>
<p>While I don’t regret that choice per se, because I chose something else I was interested in, I’ve largely come to realize that I don’t care what programming language I’m using. I care about getting the job done.</p>
<p>Also, I’m probably over the 10,000 hours of <em>something</em>, I just don’t know what. Am I an ML expert? Data expert? SQL? Python? R?</p>
<p>Is it the application of the skill that makes you an expert? I’m not sure. Because I think novices can do some incredible things if they hone in.</p>
<p>If you read one book on a topic, you’re by no means an “expert”, but you probably know more about that topic than 99% of the nation. I learned this when I spent 6 months diving into the home security industry for my first job. Pretty sure I knew more about that than anyone I spoke to. Was I an expert? I really only had maybe 300 hours. Maybe I was inexperienced. Sure.</p>
<p>And who spends literally 10,000 hours on any one thing? Like 10,000 hours on XGBoost? Image classification? Deep learning? Machine learning? A/B testing? Spreadsheets? Generalist vs specialist, etc. if you’re an ML scientist at Google, you worry about very different things than an ML scientist at a startup. At a startup, you worry about your bigquery allocation and pipeline failures. At Google you worry about what your 5th skip VP is going to deprecate that month.</p>
<p>That’s just the nature of education. There are so many things in the world to know…that being an “expert” is a relative thing. But I agree that working hard and learning useful things helps you innovate faster.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">I’d change my opinion on being an expert if I needed to beat Rocky.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Last thing, the crux is: don’t compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to yourself. That’s how you assess your progress.</p>
<p>But I’d argue: why even compare yourself to yourself? Compare your solution to the problem. Does it matter if you have 10,000 hours? No.&nbsp;What matters is if the solution fits. This is why innovations and disruptions come from unexpected places: because novices can nail solutions.</p>

  <title>My testimony: Moving across the Country</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/my-testimony-2024-01-07.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>Today is fast Sunday, a day when testimonies are shared in church. Here’s my testimony I shared today. Someone had just spoken about moving to a new place and seeing God in their lives, even if it was far away from where they had thought they needed to be. They had moved away from family.</em></p>
<p>I was reminded today of why I live where I do. Without going into personal details, as a family we decided it was time to leave the east coast and move west. As I wondered how it might be possible, I was encouraged by my wife to reach out to an old contact on a random spreadsheet I had kept seven years prior when I was first looking for jobs. The guy had since changed jobs from when he had interviewed me, but he referred me to his new company.</p>
<p>Well, this company was otherwise impossible to get noticed at, even with referrals. Turns out this guy was a lot higher than I had known. It was enough to get me the first interview. Four years later we’re still on the west coast. It’s definitely a better situation for our family in many ways.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-u-haul-moving.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Moving because when we had a desire, the Lord opened the door for us</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And in terms of family, I grew up living far away from cousins. My church congregation became my family. My parents friends became my Sunday school teachers and mentors. My friends at church became my closest confidants and kept me company in living the principles I believed in.</p>
<p>Recently, this church family helped us with meals, gifts, and emotional warmth. I don’t know what I’d do without belonging to a group of people who care for one another (I know many communities are like this, but I think it’s extra special in a Christian context where everyone wants to help and strengthen each other in kindness. We all try their best.)</p>
<p>Christ’s design that we have a church is inspired:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is <strong>one body, and one Spirit</strong>, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. <a href="../scriptures/ephesians-4.4-6">Ephesians 4.4–6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And are we not all family? The spiritual children of Christ and sons and daughters of Heavenly Father.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made <strong>ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters;</strong> for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters. … therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ… <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-5.7-8">Mosiah 5.7–8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I testify the <a href="../concepts/hand-of-god.html">Hand of God</a> is real. He leads and guides people to where they need to be gathered. And when we gather together as one body, miracles happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>I also love this scripture, how Lehi was guided to a “land of promise”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>behold, I <strong>have obtained</strong> a land of promise <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5">1 Nephi 5.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He wrote “have obtained” while he was struggling for food and water in the desert. He saw ahead to when he’d eventually live in a near rain forest paradise.</p>

  <title>What does it mean to preside?</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/what-does-it-mean-to-preside.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The responsibility of a Father is to preside:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By divine design, <strong>fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness</strong> and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. <a href="../scriptures/the-family-proclamation">The Family Proclamation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve long wondered what this meant. Earlier in my marriage I wondered: does this mean a father leads all family gatherings, has the first or last word, or delegates who says the prayer? That’s probably because the word “preside” is used synonymously with lead with respect to church callings and such:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Verily, I say unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts, there must needs be presiding elders to <strong>preside</strong> over those who are of the office of an elder; And also priests to <strong>preside</strong> over those who are of the office of a priest; 62 And also teachers to preside <strong>over</strong> those who are of the office of a teacher, in like manner, and also the deacons <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-107.60-62">Doctrine and Covenants 107.60–62</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never really wondered if this was “who calls the shots”, or “who runs the show” - that never felt like a thing because my father is a gentle, servant leader. But I know some wonder what the details of this phrase mean. And what does it mean for single moms?</p>
<p>Well, I recently learned what <em>I</em> think it means. I started getting slightly more-than-average stressed with being sleep deprived after having a newborn.</p>
<p>I noticed, by consequence, my kids appeared more agitated. I remembered my <a href="../posts/your-mood-is-contagious.html">Mood is Contagious</a>.</p>
<p>Once I got more sleep, I realized the kids model my behavior as a father than follow my words. The way I talk to them is how they talk to each other - for better or worse.</p>
<p>Every parent knows this.</p>
<p>So while “preside” technically means to lead a meeting, it also means to lead a gathering. Is a family not a gathering?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>…how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you. And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, <a href="../scriptures/3-nephi-10.4-5">3 Nephi 10.4–5</a></p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Shouldn’t we preside more like this?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Maybe we can preside more like Christ: with kindness, gentleness, and love unfeigned.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When’s the last time I walked 40 miles? 30? 20? 10?</p>
<p>It’s been a minute. Only 150 years ago or 200 years ago I may have done one of those maybe once a month or year.</p>
<p>While I’m not entirely sure it’s beneficial for my health <em>not</em> to walk a ton every day, I’m grateful for cars.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can live far from my workplace.</li>
<li>I can visit my parents in a day, today if I wanted</li>
<li>I can go to the hills, take a hike, and be back to take my kids to school</li>
<li>I can go get groceries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe life was simpler back in the days without cars, I’m not sure. But I’m grateful for the variety of life I can live <em>with</em> a car. I also remember not having easy access to a car while living in the city and I just felt so trapped all the time. Cars are great.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Growing up my mom would cut my hair. I would sit in the bathroom on a wooden stool, looking into the mirror.</p>
<p>Today I cut my son’s hair for the first time. I couldn’t help but think of those many years of one-on-one conversations with my mom.</p>
<p>Spending time just sitting and talking can be the best time we have to share. It can be something as simple as a boring haircut.</p>

  <title>AI won’t replace us. We’ll always create.</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/ai-will-not-replace-human-creativity.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I recently got back into writing some poems. <a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a> was fun to write. After the fact, I tried getting ChatGPT to create something similar. I only tried once before declaring victory.</p>
<p>Why is this poem meaningful to me? Because it has my soul in it. It’s the summation of my experience as a parent. Should you find it interesting, perhaps that’s why.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.html">The Best of Edgar Allen Poe</a> recently I’m amazed (besides how depressing he is) at how excellent a writer he is. He peers into the mind and soul and extricates anything interesting. It’s interesting because a human wrote it.</p>
<p>Do we still paint, even if a camera can take a picture? Do we still ride bikes and horses even with cars and things? Do we still read even though we have TV and movies?</p>
<p>Words. Creative expression. They will always be interesting to us. Humans are interesting to us. Stories. Social acceptance is a fundamental human need. We desire connection. We’ll like reading something because a human wrote it.</p>
<p>But what about that guy I heard about who makes a ton of money using ChatGPT to create fake digital books on Amazon. People don’t <em>know</em> it’s AI-written. Digital GenAI images now are insanely accurate - it’s only 2024. It’s very possible great AI art will inspire us more than non-AI art (whatever that means because everyone uses photoshop anyway).</p>
<p>I’m not saying we won’t find value in AI art (creative writing, digital, video, etc.). We will. It’s clear we’ll have a really hard time knowing what’s human vs not.</p>
<p>But I am saying that creativity will never disappear. We’re always going to be interested in creating - even if machines can do it better. Machines can beat us at Go and StarCraft (<a href="../posts/2023-12-25-ai-robots-are-mastering-tasks-faster-than-humans-/index.html">AI Robots are mastering tasks faster than humans</a>), but we’ll still play. Because what else will there be to do?</p>

  <title>Time</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for time.</p>
<p>Time to live. Time to breathe. Time to eat. Time to walk. Time to sit at my computer and hope I’m making a difference in the world. Time to be with my family and realize I am.</p>
<p>Children are more affected by time than others. Time robs them of their youth, forcing them minute by minute into the world. But time is generous, equitable, and just. It’s fair to everyone. We all have time.</p>
<p>But we don’t all have the same time. Someone I know had cancer. Their time was marked. Another with cancer had their marking erased. Another on a bike passed out mid ride; time ran out. Another on a hill whose time was almost out recovered quickly. Time.</p>
<p>And I’m grateful for that time is temporary. (<a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a>)</p>

  <title>How I use the Book of Mormon</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/how-to-use-the-book-of-mormon.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Book of Mormon is the most powerful book I’ve read.</p>
<p>This is how I get the most out of the book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye <strong>must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father</strong> in the name of Christ, that <strong>he will consecrate thy performance unto thee</strong>, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9">2 Nephi 32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve read a lot of self help books. It’s not like that. This is a book that inspires personal revelation and a relationship with Christ and Heavenly Father. I get the most out of it when I have a true desire in my heart:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a <strong>sincere heart, with real intent,</strong> having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. <a href="../scriptures/moroni-10.4">Moroni 10.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I read it in a rush, I don’t get much out of it. When I don’t pray before hand, or if I’m not sincere, I don’t really get anything substantive.</p>
<p>It’s like texting vs calling a friend. If you’re in a rush, you give a half thought text. But if you’re on a long drive and want to build a relationship, you give the friend a call.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-plant-a-seed-and-grow.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">If you plant a seed, you need to nourish it</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The best insight doesn’t come from the Book of Mormon. It comes from the Holy Ghost. So I can read the book as a literary critique and not see its divinity. But as I read it trying to build a relationship with Heavenly Father, then I feel that relationship grow.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be <strong>planted in your heart</strong>, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it <strong>beginneth to be delicious to me.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/alma-32.28">Alma 32.28</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>Hard Work and its Reward</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/hard-work.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>My dad grew up on a sheep farm. And his dad grew up farming too. Same with his dad, all the way back to when dads were a thing.</p>
<p>One of my grand/great grands worked on a beet farm. I read a story once about the beet farmers by Jay Jensen. It was called “Hoe to the end of the row” (apparently there’s a poem with that same title).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-beat-farming.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Beet it, just beet it…</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The principle the author shared was of planting to the end of the row. Some people got lazy and gave up 80% of the way through. But the hard workers went to the end. They took pride in it. And when the harvest came the boss knew who was coming back next summer: those with finished rows.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for hard work. My grandpa told my dad to work with his mind, not his back.<br>
So my dad got a desk job. And so did I.</p>
<p>Perhaps if my grandpa had seen today maybe he would instead say “get off those screens and go plant a beet”. But hard work is hard regardless of it being mental or physical. “Hard work” is the reward itself.</p>
<p>In another quote my father shared with me: “the gift of a good life is having lived it”. Same applies to hard work. The reward of hard work is having done it.</p>
<p>Most of what we do on a daily basis goes unnoticed. The rewards are for ourselves. This is a joy of life.</p>

  <title>What startups and musicians have in common</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/what-startups-and-musicians-have-in-common.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was reminded of a video I watched a while back on YouTube. It was a great documentary about these new artists and their debate about whether to sign a record label (there’s a recent trend to selling music as an independent artist).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-musician-signing-record-label-watercolors.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Putting pen to ink</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I forget all the details, but there are some roughly insane trends that are generally interesting as I recall:</p>
<ul>
<li>new record labels are for $500k give or take. This is so the artist can invest a year into their music and get an album out, pay for production, etc.</li>
<li>many artists at that early stage aren’t financially literate and end up wasting the (they’re musicians, not bankers)</li>
<li>Some have to pay back the money</li>
<li>Up to 85% of the streaming royalties are owed to the label (started when streaming became a thing)</li>
<li>Labels also take a large portion of touring revenues now (something that wasn’t common 10 years ago)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this similar to tech startups? Lots.</p>
<p>Musicians have to find product market fit. They need to find their customers. Their monthly listeners.</p>
<p>They need to keep them coming back.</p>
<p>They need to differentiate.</p>
<p>Those who are customer focused and build a following are those who succeed. (Money in the bank and relying too much on the label can cripple you)</p>
<section id="the-musicians-in-town" class="level1">
<h1>The Musicians in Town</h1>
<p>I remember hanging out with some new artists while I was running my startup (we both used the same videographer). I couldn’t help but notice how similar the dynamics were. The founders. The first hires (replacements). The convos about who gets what. It’s all very fascinating.</p>
<p>Not much else to say.</p>

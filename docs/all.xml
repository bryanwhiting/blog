  <title>The Multiverse of Careers</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Spoken about in <a href="../tech/dreaming-software.html">The Dream State of Software</a>, Paul of <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> has a moment where he’s both past and present in his mind. He doesn’t know even whether he’s had his kid or not.</p>
<p>In a podcast I listened to lately on happiness, one suggestion was to write out all your goals and cross them off from day one. Pretend like it doesn’t even matter if you accomplish them. This helps free you.</p>
<p>Careers are like both of these things. We want everything. We can pretend like we have it. We can come to terms with it. And we can say “doesn’t matter if I don’t get that, because I’ve got a life outside my career.”</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Consider your career from your deathbed (<a href="../posts/my-tombstone.html">My Tombstone</a>). What path did you take that mattered? What were all the alternate realities and multiverses you could have had.</p>
<p>Put them all together. In one multiverse you’ve been fired. In another you end up getting insanely wealthy. In another you start your own company. In another you become an online blogger.</p>
<p>All of them can’t be true when you do this exercise extensively enough. And choosing which one probably doesn’t matter as much (right vs wrong path thinking). If you’ve ever left a job you realize that nothing really comes over with you. Most relationships at work are short lived and contextual, like your relationships in high school. And that’s life.</p>
<p>Happiness is perhaps being okay with not having everything you desire, except for the few things that are truly attainable: peace with God, self, and cherished relationships.</p>

  <title>Zoom</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/zoom.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I first heard about zoom many years ago on a random podcast. Had no idea what it was or why it was useful. Now it’s enabled me to work remotely, chat with friends across the nation, and even attend church during lockdowns.</p>
<p>Behind this is a person with an idea that changed the world. Surely they weren’t the first video service, but they build off the earlier, crappier products.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for V1’s like Skype that paved the way for Zoom, which learned a ton, probably poached some talent, and gave me something with using.</p>

  <title>Your Mood is Contagious</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Moods flow. Keep the negative waves at bay</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There’s no question that moods are contagious. I once asked someone at the beach to leash their dog, and they slightly rebuked me, “this is a dog friendly beach.” <em>Well, so it is,</em> I thought, grumpily. I complained to a family member about this grumpy dog owner.</p>
<p>Moods escalate. And negative moods are even more pervasive and contagious than positive ones. They say a disgruntled customer tells more friends and family than happy ones. Why is this?</p>
<p>In the “Black Cat” (<a href="../book-review/the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.html">The Best of Edgar Allen Poe</a>), Poe describes a gruesome tale man who wanted to do evil just for the sake of it. That it’s in his nature. Not because you want to do the thing, but because you want to do a forbidden thing. The same goes the other way, for sure. But I think we trend slightly pessimistic because being an optimist is more beneficial, more rewarding and therefore more difficult.</p>
<p>A leader once told me when I was managing a team, “They’ll pick up on <em>everything</em> you do or say.” Oddly, I was picking up on what he was saying.</p>
<p>So when you lead, lead carefully. Whether in home or work, lead with kindness, compassion, and restraint. Speak three kind words before a negative. Ask to understand before assuming. Lead as a servant. It takes all the effort to overcome negative vibes, and who better equipped than the leader to do it?</p>
<p>Don’t be Moriarty:</p>

<p>“Why can’t you be more hopeful for a change?”</p>

  <title>Writing Ethos</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/lists/writing-ethos.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>List of reasons why I write this blog and principles I aspire to. They evolve over time, and I like to keep track.</p>
<p>2023-12-31</p>
<ul>
<li>Write every day (Seth Godin style). Many posts will be bad. But higher repetitions means better writing.</li>
<li>Learn by writing. Synthesis only happens when sharing.</li>
<li>Write first, edit later.</li>
<li>Use writing to actively digest world news. Doomscrolling is futile and anxiety inducing. Writing and synthesizing helps me comparmentalize the world and where I fit into it.</li>
<li>Develop an opinion. Strong opinions, weakly held. A ship is better heading in any direction than none at all. An opinion is a direction.</li>
<li>Every post is a story. If it’s not a story, it’s not worth reading.</li>
<li>I am me. I write what’s on my mind. I hope it’s interesting to different people in different ways.</li>
<li>Write each post for one real person in my life, based on one real discussion.</li>
<li>Gratitude is healing, produces optimism, and reveals a new way. Give thanks daily. I give thanks, therefore I have.</li>
</ul>
<p>2022-12-05</p>
<ul>
<li>All blogs are wrong, but some are useful (riff on George Box’s quote that all models are wrong)</li>
</ul>

  <title>The Dream State of Software</title>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Dreaming code working is ever coders dream</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I returned from vacation yesterday and tried running my code. It didn’t work. I looked at code I had written, it had my imports correctly and all - why wasn’t it running?</p>
<p>The file it was importing didn’t exist.</p>
<p>I thought I created that. I swear I made it. My coworker remarked, “oh so you set up all the scafffolding but didn’t write the actual code?” I was in disbelief. maybe it was deleted by accident or stashed on another branch. But the <code>git log</code> shows all: the imported file never existed.</p>
<p>In <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>, Paul Atriedes has many visions and the author uses this feature to skip the book ahead three years. Paul wakes up one morning and doesn’t know what’s past or future. It’s all one in his mind.</p>
<p>So it is with software. It gets created in the mind near instantly. Coding is a burden, the journey of many failures and design choices to enable the simple vision of the mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps Gen AI can help us dream software faster. I look forward to when my dreams are realities, and not the rude awakening I still have coding to do.</p>

  <title>Share your testimony</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/share-your-testimony.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>At least a dozen people claimed to have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>There were the “Three Witnesses”, the “Eight Witnesses”, Emma Smith, Joseph Smith, and perhaps a few others.</p>
<p>What’s powerful to me is this testimony that the Eight shared:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it. <a href="../scriptures/testimony-of-eight-witnesses">Testimony of Eight Witnesses</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admire any who live with such conviction. It calls to mind the John Hancock’s of the world.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: <a href="../scriptures/testimony-of-eight-witnesses">Testimony of Eight Witnesses</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re invited to “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in,” (<a href="../scriptures/mosiah-18.9">Mosiah 18.9</a>), to share what we’ve seen.</p>
<p>May we stand boldly, which doesn’t mean confrontational, contentiously, or loudly. It just means unequivocally. Sincerely.</p>

  <title>My Tombstone</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/my-tombstone.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>They call it a death meditation, to look back from the end of your life and reflect as if you had just died (out of body style). Here’s my tombstone:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Here lies Bryan, son of Aragon, data scientist extraordinaire who knew how to use regular expressions and properly test linear regression assumptions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seem like a good tombstone?</p>
<p>Why do we measure our lives by something nobody cares about? Consider Steve Jobs, Isaac Newton, or whomever you idolize. What are they known for? Only a few things.</p>
<p>I read <a href="../book-review/steve-jobs-biography.html">Steve Jobs (Biography)</a> a while back. And I also read <a href="../book-review/leonardo-da-vinci.html">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. First was 25 hours, second was 17 hours. And guess what - that’s less than two days combined. Two “impressive” lives summed up in a few days.</p>
<p>My grandma’s obituary was brief. Yet her life was filled with millions of unwritten sentences - many written on my life. The in between moments. The laying around moments. The relationship moments. (Maybe it’s called a relation-“ship” because it sails the waters of life continuously, despite the infrequent dock postings.)</p>
<p>Nobody’s going to remember me, except those who call me dad, husband, brother, son, and friend. And I’m okay with that. I was never that good at data science anyway 😉.</p>

  <title>Love Thy Neighbor, But Have Friends</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/love-thy-neighbor-but-have-friends.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Christ invited us to love our neighbors:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord. <a href="../scriptures/leviticus-19.18">Leviticus 19.18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But He himself had his friends: his disciples. He didn’t try hanging out with the Pharisees or the Romans. He spent time at dinner with his apostles and followers.</p>
<p>He had four brothers. Did he call them to apostleship? No.&nbsp;Did he <em>not</em> love them? No, he loved them.</p>
<p>He loved the Roman as much as he loved John the Beloved: enough to die for them and prepare the way for them to rejoin him in heaven.</p>
<p>But he also spent time with those he loved. What does this teach us about love?</p>

  <title>The miracles of Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/the-miracles-of-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m reading the Book of Mormon this year with the Come Follow Me (by <a href="../christianity/the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.html">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>) curriculum. I hope you enjoy as I write something I learn each day.</p>
<p>I’ll tag things “scripture of the day” for any one-scripture thoughts. If it’s related to the Come Follow Me theme, l’ll add a tag.</p>
<section id="miracles-of-christ" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Miracles of Christ</h1>
<p>This scripture caught me eye:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, <strong>working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-3.5">Mosiah 3.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-christ-healing-clay.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Christ healing all who come unto him</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I have seen miracles in my life. I’ve also seen collateral-miracles, which is the miracle that happens when you’re expecting one thing but another thing happens instead.</p>
<p>I’ve seen someone healed from a Priesthood blessing. I’ve seen someone healed from depression. I’ve seen someone healed from doubt and disbelief. I’ve felt the power of the Holy Ghost in my life.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen people not healed, left to the struggles we all face, and yet miracles abound.</p>
<p>So what is a miracle? Is it an outcome? No.&nbsp;It’s the process of seeing how an event can be changed by God for the benefit of an individual. Occasionally, there are supernatural changes in the natural course of things.</p>
<p>If any of these things sounds fanciful to those not of my Church, it’s actually a lot more simple and plain than it sounds. Because “the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a <strong>still small voice</strong>.” (<a href="../scriptures/1-kings-19.11-12">1 Kings 19.11–12</a>) For me, seeing a miracle of Christ is perceiving the hand by how he operates.</p>
<p>Some have a hard time reading the Old Testament because how can a God who brought fire from heaven, parted the seas, gave manna from heaven also be a God who doesn’t do those things today?</p>
<p>I’d argue the miracles of Christ have risen to the point where he works according to our knowledge and insight. I believe in a Christ who is the source of all truth, and who teaches truth (even scientific) to everyone, regardless of their belief system. <a href="../scriptures/matthew-5.45">Matthew 5.45</a></p>
<p>And so, the miracles of God today are happening within science. Within tech. He doesn’t have to heal us by God’s power if he gave us medicine to do the same.</p>
<p>He also doesn’t show his miracles the same way. The people of the Old Testament were simple. They needed signs. But signs aren’t faith, and I believe these days before His second coming are days of greater faith. Days where we’ll have fewer signs.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Therefore, <strong>blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble</strong>; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe. Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe. 18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it. <a href="../scriptures/alma-32.16-18">Alma 32.16–18</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>The Psychology of New Software Releases and its Parallels with Fashion</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/why-we-want-new-software.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>What is it about a new release that gets people excited? Would you buy software that never changes? How about a hammer?</p>
<p>Why are we okay with buying a hammer, but not stagnant software? Our culture is addicted to new widgets. A/B testing.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Shipping software like fashion, every season</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Software releases are free, but development is not. Therefore, research and development is constant, whereas the Hammer company hasn’t needed to update its product in a couple…millennia. That’s why they call it software. It’s not hard to make.</p>
<p>Is there a way to sell software like you sell a hammer?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;Because per <a href="../book-review/innovators-dilemma.html">Innovator’s Dilemma</a>, those who can out-do you will. And software is easy to alter and improve. I’m not convinced all “updates” done in the software industry are actually improvements, but people like change. Ever see a fashion line repeat itself?</p>
<p>Software is like fashion.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been a member of this church, also known as the Mormon church, my whole life. I’ve studied it, learned its history, and have come to believe that it provides a marvelous sense of purpose and guidance. I believe it teaches the most truth about Jesus Christ and His plan of happiness for us, and I believe it’s people (including my own) have a lot to learn from those teachings.</p>

  <title>I’m grateful for rest</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rest.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for rest. Time away. I’m grateful that by taking time away, my brain resets. Now I’m more energized to tackle the day.</p>
<p>Why is rest necessary? I don’t know. But it is. Bodies need sleep. Minds need breaks.</p>
<p>I find that the mind is easier to overrule than a tired body. Why? Why can we push our brains more than is healthy for them? It’s hard to answer, but only rest tells us where our mind can be.</p>

  <title>Good Books</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/good-books.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for good books. They take time. They take effort. They’re art (<a href="../gratitude/grateful-for-artists.html">I’m grateful for artists</a>). I’m finishing <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> right now and I can’t imagine how long and how arduous the task must have been. They say it took Herbert six years, but many years in addition thinking about it. It’s powerfully creative, and has set the tone for science fiction for the next 60 years.</p>
<p>I’m grateful people can be so powerfully curious, intelligent, motivated, and capable to create such a book. Humans can do incredible things.</p>

<p>Notes: - socrates had a voice he felt was from Gods. Daimonion - Memorization. Lots of it. - Humanism - treated sacrifices to the gods as transactional. This meant they relied on themselves rather than gods to teach them. - Odd relationships (pedophelia) - function: intended purpose. Virtue: quality of function.</p>

  <title>Replacing human work with AI</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/swapping-out-human-labor-for-ai.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/4-questions-to-ask-swapping-out-human-labor-ai">recent MIT article</a>, the author discusses how to know if you’re ready for AI adoption. It boils things down to a rather obvious four-step questioning process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How much time would I save if I used AI?</li>
<li>How expensive is the task? (How expensive is the salary of the person doing the task.)</li>
<li>How capable is the AI of completing the task successfully?</li>
<li>How easy is it to determine if the output is good/correct?</li>
</ol>
<p>I say obvious because these are actually just questions you’d ask of any task worth doing by any person at your company. In every decision in running a business, there is an ROI question at play - what does this person cost me, what’s the return?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-ai-task-vs-human.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">It’s not: “should I use AI?” It’s “how?”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="knowing-what-you-dont-know-and-how-to-know-you-know-it" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Knowing what you don’t know, and how to know you know it</h1>
<p>The author lays out the hypothetical “I asked this ChatGPT to write something in Perl and it did it well on the second try!”</p>
<p>Consider that. Do you know what Perl is? Would you know how to evaluate if the code is complete? How would you execute such code - do you know the programs to run?</p>
<p>AI cannot solve these environmental, contextual problems yet. It can’t think through all the nuance. And, if you have an expensive salary, there’s a reason: you have a lot of experience. Experience to know what Perl is. Experience to recognize the code’s flaws and poor design patterns. This makes you all the more valuable <em>with</em> AI.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a highly creative, curious person could just ask AI “what programming languages are good for this task?” Like Neo in <em>The Matrix</em> when he “downloads kung-foo” into his brain, we all can get up to speed a lot faster.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I’ve read stories of people without technical backgrounds building websites with GPT. On the surface this is cool. Now do they care to keep doing that? Is that their personality? Are they going to get bored? This is the differentiator. And the people who stick with GPT to build a website and remain curious are the ones who will get ahead. Those who give up won’t.</p></li></div></section>
<section id="how-do-i-adopt-ai-not-should" class="level1">
<h1><em>How</em> do I adopt AI? (Not “should”)</h1>
<p>To me, the question isn’t “do these four questions check the box”? Instead, I see AI as an always-on strategy with various ranges of usefulness:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do you care what the final product looks like?
<ul>
<li>Are you okay with an 80% solution?</li>
<li>Is this throwaway work?</li>
<li>Do you plan to maintain this code as part of a 10,000 line code base?</li>
<li>Do you just need ideas to get started?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the risks in firing my experts?
<ul>
<li>Who will catch the mistakes of the AI? What if it’s wrong?</li>
<li>In many aspects of your business the risk of being wrong might be a lot lower than you think.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What <em>can’t</em> it do well?
<ul>
<li>Assume AI is doing everything at your company - what would that look like?</li>
<li>Give AI the benefit of the doubt first, then work backward from what it can’t do.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>I think that AI holds great power to aid our jobs in a lot of ways. It <em>will</em> replace a lot of jobs, just as there are far fewer farmers today than a hundred years ago. Those farmers are far more effective than ever before - we get more yield for less. It will replace <em>part</em> of your job - the stuff you know how to do but would rather have someone else do it.</p>
<p>Coders <em>will</em> be highly automatable, especially those who think otherwise. Lawyers. Graphic designers. Marketers. This is a cycle as old as time: people and businesses who think they have a strong hold on the market (think: BlackBerry, <em>Innovators Dilemma</em>) are the ones who always get eclipsed. # Learn the new skillset</p>
<p>Have everyone at your company use it today. It’s the new programming language. It’s the new way of authoring. And yes, prompt engineering (how you ask it questions) widely impacts its usefulness. Therefore, we all need to learn how to prompt engineer.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is the new skillset: <strong>knowing what question to ask and how to pressure test its validity</strong>. In essence, the learning acceleration curve has skyrocketed, and one person can now actually be good at many things a lot faster. It’s the curious person who will win. It’s the visionary. The evaluator. The one who knows where they want to go, can discern if the steps they’re taking are taking them to their destination, and who have the ability to adapt and course correct when necessary.</p>
<p>For now, AI can hardly do things outside data it was trained on. In the future 10 years that may change. If so, we’ll all be on the edge of scientific discovery, pushing the bounds of creative work, and focusing on the nuance that will win/lose that legal case. AI will have a seat at the table. But so will we.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why I’m grateful for eyes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>They’re fun to look at</strong>. Ever look at a newborn’s eyes? Your significant other’s?</li>
<li><strong>They interpret light.</strong> My ears can’t interpret light. My feet can’t. But my eyes can. They can perceive depth, color, texture, etc.</li>
<li><strong>They inspired the creation of the camera,</strong> and we use to our eyes to look at photos of good memories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Paraphrasing a quote from <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>, “don’t rely too much on sight, it dulls your other senses”. I wonder what I’d be able to see if I didn’t have eye sight. I suppose I could be grateful for that too: that life is still wonderful even without eye sight.</p>

<h1>Alpha and Omega</h1>
<ul>
<li>Why would Christ use these words? They’re Greek. Why not Hebrew?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/1?id=p16&amp;lang=eng#p16">Romans 1:16</a> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This teaches me that Christ speaks the language of those whom he’s speaking to.</p>

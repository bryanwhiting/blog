  <title>Replacing human work with AI</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/swapping-out-human-labor-for-ai.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/4-questions-to-ask-swapping-out-human-labor-ai">recent MIT article</a>, the author discusses how to know if you’re ready for AI adoption. It boils things down to a rather obvious four-step questioning process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How much time would I save if I used AI?</li>
<li>How expensive is the task? (How expensive is the salary of the person doing the task.)</li>
<li>How capable is the AI of completing the task successfully?</li>
<li>How easy is it to determine if the output is good/correct?</li>
</ol>
<p>I say obvious because these are actually just questions you’d ask of any task worth doing by any person at your company. In every decision in running a business, there is an ROI question at play - what does this person cost me, what’s the return?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-ai-task-vs-human.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">It’s not: “should I use AI?” It’s “how?”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="knowing-what-you-dont-know-and-how-to-know-you-know-it" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Knowing what you don’t know, and how to know you know it</h1>
<p>The author lays out the hypothetical “I asked this ChatGPT to write something in Perl and it did it well on the second try!”</p>
<p>Consider that. Do you know what Perl is? Would you know how to evaluate if the code is complete? How would you execute such code - do you know the programs to run?</p>
<p>AI cannot solve these environmental, contextual problems yet. It can’t think through all the nuance. And, if you have an expensive salary, there’s a reason: you have a lot of experience. Experience to know what Perl is. Experience to recognize the code’s flaws and poor design patterns. This makes you all the more valuable <em>with</em> AI.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a highly creative, curious person could just ask AI “what programming languages are good for this task?” Like Neo in <em>The Matrix</em> when he “downloads kung-foo” into his brain, we all can get up to speed a lot faster.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I’ve read stories of people without technical backgrounds building websites with GPT. On the surface this is cool. Now do they care to keep doing that? Is that their personality? Are they going to get bored? This is the differentiator. And the people who stick with GPT to build a website and remain curious are the ones who will get ahead. Those who give up won’t.</p></li></div></section>
<section id="how-do-i-adopt-ai-not-should" class="level1">
<h1><em>How</em> do I adopt AI? (Not “should”)</h1>
<p>To me, the question isn’t “do these four questions check the box”? Instead, I see AI as an always-on strategy with various ranges of usefulness:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do you care what the final product looks like?
<ul>
<li>Are you okay with an 80% solution?</li>
<li>Is this throwaway work?</li>
<li>Do you plan to maintain this code as part of a 10,000 line code base?</li>
<li>Do you just need ideas to get started?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the risks in firing my experts?
<ul>
<li>Who will catch the mistakes of the AI? What if it’s wrong?</li>
<li>In many aspects of your business the risk of being wrong might be a lot lower than you think.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What <em>can’t</em> it do well?
<ul>
<li>Assume AI is doing everything at your company - what would that look like?</li>
<li>Give AI the benefit of the doubt first, then work backward from what it can’t do.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>I think that AI holds great power to aid our jobs in a lot of ways. It <em>will</em> replace a lot of jobs, just as there are far fewer farmers today than a hundred years ago. Those farmers are far more effective than ever before - we get more yield for less. It will replace <em>part</em> of your job - the stuff you know how to do but would rather have someone else do it.</p>
<p>Coders <em>will</em> be highly automatable, especially those who think otherwise. Lawyers. Graphic designers. Marketers. This is a cycle as old as time: people and businesses who think they have a strong hold on the market (think: BlackBerry, <em>Innovators Dilemma</em>) are the ones who always get eclipsed. # Learn the new skillset</p>
<p>Have everyone at your company use it today. It’s the new programming language. It’s the new way of authoring. And yes, prompt engineering (how you ask it questions) widely impacts its usefulness. Therefore, we all need to learn how to prompt engineer.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is the new skillset: <strong>knowing what question to ask and how to pressure test its validity</strong>. In essence, the learning acceleration curve has skyrocketed, and one person can now actually be good at many things a lot faster. It’s the curious person who will win. It’s the visionary. The evaluator. The one who knows where they want to go, can discern if the steps they’re taking are taking them to their destination, and who have the ability to adapt and course correct when necessary.</p>
<p>For now, AI can hardly do things outside data it was trained on. In the future 10 years that may change. If so, we’ll all be on the edge of scientific discovery, pushing the bounds of creative work, and focusing on the nuance that will win/lose that legal case. AI will have a seat at the table. But so will we.</p>

  <title>Eyes</title>

</figure>
</div>
<p>There are several reasons why I’m grateful for eyes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>They’re fun to look at</strong>. Ever look at a newborn’s eyes? Your significant other’s?</li>
<li><strong>They interpret light.</strong> My ears can’t interpret light. My feet can’t. But my eyes can. They can perceive depth, color, texture, etc.</li>
<li><strong>They inspired the creation of the camera,</strong> and we use to our eyes to look at photos of good memories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Paraphrasing a quote from <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>, “don’t rely too much on sight, it dulls your other senses”. I wonder what I’d be able to see if I didn’t have eye sight. I suppose I could be grateful for that too: that life is still wonderful even without eye sight.</p>

  <title>Water as a Currency?</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/water-as-a-currency.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The book <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> is amazing in many ways, but the one that piqued my curiosity today was this: what if water was a currency?</p>
<p>The book gives great reverence to water, specifically talking about the lengths the Fremen go to to preserve their water. They even harvest it the dead, as water is life. They see people around them as water vessels. If you’re 100 kg (220lbs), they say you carry 60 kg of water weight. That’s a 60 liters. If you drink an average of 2 liters per day, that’s enough water to sustain you for 30 days. Fascinating how you would die without drinking water for a week though, right?</p>
<p>Some on this earth live with such water scarcity. Most in the US don’t. Consider what else we can focus on because we take the most life-giving substance for granted.</p>

  <title>Emotional Recovery</title>

  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/emotional-recovery.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Imagine you just ran a red light at 10:15pm. You were driving without music or phone distractions, you just zoned out and coasted through.</p>
<p>Your emotions run high as you consider what might have happened otherwise. But nothing happened. Something <em>could</em> have happened, but nothing did. In the end, all is well.</p>
<p>How do you calm yourself down? In <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a>, someone almost dies because of Paul’s “mistake”. But nobody died.</p>
<p>Life is full of thousands of these things. Several of them we recognize and brush off “oh that was close.” But how many events go unnoticed because we were unaware we even could have done harm (no red light to be found)?</p>
<p>How we identify and recover is a skill. How do you process such experiences? How do you get over the person who cuts you off on the highway? How do you get over not realizing you cut someone off?</p>

  <title>Beaches</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for beaches. That they exist. That they haven’t been removed. That they are places where people can go and recharge.</p>
<p>At 5pm, hundreds of people showed up to take a photo of this hydrogen blob descending to the horizon line. Why?</p>
<p>Because sunsets are cool, and so are beaches.</p>

  <title>Quarto vs. quartz for Obsidian blog</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/quarto-vs-quartz-for-obsidian.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Things I like/dislike about <code>quarto</code> are listed <a href="../posts/quarto-feature-requests/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, I love <code>quarto</code> and the main thing I don’t like about quarto is how slow it is, compared to say, <code>hugo</code>.</p>
<p>I looked heavily into <code>quartz</code>, which is explained <a href="https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/">here</a> as a way to publish your Obsidian vault on GitHub. And <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/">here’s an example</a> of a digital garden someone uses with <code>quartz</code>, it’s pretty slick. Here are the <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features">features of quartz</a>.</p>
<p>Why <code>quarto</code>? I really like the design of a blog, as I tend to think better in “post” form rather than never-ending-garden-of-thoughts. I like reading blogs because I assume the thoughts are complete. Quartz is great if you just want your own wiki. I just don’t really care about the network graphs and all and I don’t think other people reading them care either.</p>
<p>I want to focus on writing and sometimes long form writing. Quarto enables a lot, is easy to setup and customize, has great search, has a ton of markdown desires (tabs, callouts, asides, footnotes), can render code (Python/R) when I want to be adventurous, and has a blog interface for posts.</p>
<p>Largely they’re the same, and maybe I’ll use quartz at some point. But I’m happy where I am now.</p>

  <title>Blogging with Obsidian and Quarto</title>

<div class="callout callout-style-simple callout-tip no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>First half is my philosophy on the relationship between learning, notetaking, and blogging.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love to learn</li>
<li>Writing helps me learn</li>
<li>Publicly writing increases my focus</li>
</ul>
<p>Second half is how I use Obsidian and Quarto, alternatives I’ve tried, and my actually flow. I detail what tools I use, how I use them.</p>
<ul>
<li>set up relative links</li>
<li>Have one img folder</li>
<li>Use templater to manage new post templates and relative links</li>
<li>Use linter</li>
<li>Use commander for toolbar palette</li>
<li>dataview to find drafts</li>
<li>Tags to flag ideas</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I’ve had a blog since 2016. Started with Jekyll. Then blogdown. Tried medium in 2020 because it had a good mobile app and I was able to publish every day. Then I didn’t know how to get my posts out of there so I lost interest. Then I found quarto, which I was excited about because I have always loved Rmarkdown (things like tabs, executable code, etc.). Then I tried Substack, which I did for a few weeks but eventually gave up because 1) no mobile app to write and 2) how do I get my stuff off of there?</p>
<p>Seth Godin writes every day, and I love his blog and take it as an inspiration. In one post he mentions how “some say do a podcast, others say write on platform x or platform Y”. (Medium, Substack, etc.) He recommends: those tools always serve the 1%. If you’re the 1%, you make money. Otherwise you don’t. So you might as well own your own content.</p>
<p>I know two Instagram and TikTok influencers with 100k and 300k followers respectively. The 100k made $5k in 2022. The 300k TikToker still makes maybe $100/mo. They each put in 20 hours+ a week.</p>
<p>So I’m giving up the illusion I’ll ever make money off a blog or my content. I write because I always have. I write publicly now because I found a way to do so online, from my phone.</p>
<p>This is how I blog daily using quarto (for the website) and Obsidian (for the editor).</p>
<section id="own-your-platform" class="level1">
<h1>Own your platform</h1>
<p>After all the years blogging, giving up, coming back, etc, there are many things that are my personal needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile first. I can’t write at my computer. This isn’t my job.</li>
<li>Footnotes: many blogging platforms don’t allow for them or handle them well. Footnotes are essential in long content.</li>
<li>Customizable: I need to be able to add styling how I like it. This is part of the creative process.</li>
<li>Tags: having and filtering by tags is nice</li>
<li>Portable: if I stop blogging for 9 months I need to be able to move it to the next shiny object platform. I need to own my content. I also don’t like posting on LinkedIn or Facebook directly because I see my writing as my creative work. Those platforms don’t let you save or share those links later on.<br>
</li>
<li>Relative links: I need to be able to link to other posts. This is part of the mental note taking journey.</li>
<li>Subscribe button. (Substack and Medium are built for this!)</li>
<li>Comments: 99% of people don’t comment, but when people reach out it feels like I did something for the world. It also makes the blog more approachable, even if nobody every posts.</li>
<li>Hackable/automatable: I need templates. I need code. I need to be able to automate things. (At one point I figured out how to set up automations to post straight to Instagram from GitHub actions. I’m going to bring that back!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Substack does footnotes well, linking to notes poorly, doesn’t have a mobile editor for posts, and isn’t portable. It handles tags, subscribers, and distribution extremely well, and makes it easy to have multiple publications. But it’s got the vendor lock in.</p>
<p>Medium had an excellent mobile editing experience, but again - vendor lock in. And you’ve gotta kinda buy into the Medium-way-of-doing-posts.</p>
<p>All platforms have their vibe. If you want to be popular on TikTok, you gotta dance. Although I personally love to dance, I want my site to be creative and my own.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-blog-with-obsidianquarto" class="level1">
<h1>Why blog with obsidian/quarto?</h1>
<p>Enter Obsidian and Quarto. Obsidian makes managing and editing content a breeze (things like draft management, sorting files, organizing images, etc is all super easy):</p>
<p>Why obsidian as my editor?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It makes writing markdown a breeze</li>
<li>It has tons of extensions, such as managing footnotes, linting files, spell checking, etc.</li>
<li>It makes it really easy to link to other files (relative links)</li>
<li>It makes it easy to refactor (move stuff around)</li>
<li>It works with markdown. The files are just plain text files in my Files app on my iPhone.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Writing flow</h1>
<p>Every writer has their flow. The tools they use should reflect their mental process of writing, and not the other way around. If you’re trying to get your brain to work like the tool does, rather than using tools that working like your brain, you’re ngmi. If you’re like me, you’ll try it for a while and then give up. (I may give up after this post, but at least this post isn’t saved on Blogger.com!)</p>
<p>Here’s mine:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get an idea</li>
<li>Categorize it (religious, tech, life, etc)</li>
<li>Create a file</li>
<li>Mark as draft</li>
<li>Write some ideas</li>
<li>Edit it (if long), reread a few times</li>
<li>Unmark as draft</li>
<li>Post to the internet, read a few more times in live version and make edits</li>
<li>Tag it</li>
<li>Find old drafts, finish them</li>
<li>Add an image, either from my phone camera or chatgpt. Save image in the right folder.</li>
<li>Write alt text to the images.</li>
<li>Create links to other entries.</li>
<li>Make some footnotes for content that doesn’t flow</li>
<li>Cry and debate if I’m a good writer or if anyone is even listening anymore</li>
<li>Add a subscribe button</li>
<li>share a good one to social media</li>
<li>Check my Google analytics to see if I’m popular. Check subscribers to see if I got any. Wonder why I care anyway because I know I won’t make money off this.</li>
<li>Get an idea for a new post while reading a book and start again</li>
</ol>
<p>The process of getting ideas from a source, and writing from those ideas, makes me want to be able to connect the entry to the source (book or podcast). Sure, I don’t have to write. And sometimes writing is wasted time (writing for writing’s sake), but I enjoy it.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-writing-flow-with-obsidian-and-quarto" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>My writing flow with Obsidian and Quarto</h1>
<p>At the risk of nobody ever reading this far, I’ll keep this high level, and if someone cares about something ask me in the comments.</p>
<p>First, see <a href="../posts/quarto-from-phone/index.html">Quarto from Phone</a> to see how I set up Working Copy to sync my Obsidian repo with GitHub.</p>
<p>Here’s my flow with obsidian:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Read a book. Create new book note using <a href="../_templates/new-post.md">new-post</a> via the Templater obsidian plugin. This lets me create a new note in a folder of my choice, give a title, make a filename with a good url slug. Adds some categories automatically.</li>
<li>When idea comes up, take note in book note. When substantial idea comes up, create a quick draft of a new post using Templater. Enable draft: true if i don’t finish.</li>
<li>Use Obsidian Dataview to create a list of all outstanding drafts. I can come back and finish.</li>
<li>Use Obsidian Custom Sort to sort the files in my repo how I want. This package helped me to stop time-stamping my URLs (which I thought was good for sorting). Instead, I can sort by modified time (note custom sort isn’t necessary for modified time sorting), but custom sort allows for sorting by yaml front matter.</li>
<li>When I’m ready to post, create an image using ChatGPT app. Click on the image in the app, share, save to files. It will save to the img/ folder in my root. Next image? Saves here (iPhone remembers).
<ol type="1">
<li>At some point I was creating folders for every blog post so I could reference images there. I’m giving this up for two reasons: 1) every file would then need to be named “index.md” and 2) more folders is more noise. So instead, I have one place for all images, which makes it easier to save and I don’t have to click a bunch of subfolders every time I add an image.</li>
<li>Also, screenshot any photos you may want to add so as to remove the location metadata.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Use Footnote Shortcut plugin to more efficiently write footnotes. Add a hotkey to the mobile obsidian editor toolbar to quickly add footnotes. <sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Set up an iOS shortcut to do a “git pull”, “git commit”, “git push” on the repo. Put this shortcut on my home page. Since I have a synced folder, this happens very efficiently!<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>Set up a github actions to build the blog using <code>quarto render</code>. See <a href="../posts/quarto-vs-quartz-for-obsidian.html">Quarto vs.&nbsp;quartz for Obsidian blog</a></li>
<li>Publish to GitHub pages with the docs/ folder.</li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;This footnote is added with the tap of a button. Brilliant!</p></li><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;You can also set up an automation to sync anytime you leave the app, but I’ve found that gets kind of annoying because sometimes there can be data loss with a git pull that happens without thinking about it.</p></li></div><p>And that’s it. That’s my flow. If you like this, ask me a question.</p>

  <title>Leaving my Startup was the Right Decision</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/leaving-my-startup-was-the-right-decision.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I remember in 2014 deciding whether to leave my startup after having just helped raise a seed round and finish a highly successful kickstarter. It was either move with the team to Seattle or stay and finish my Master’s degree. My married cofounder even suggested “you could find your wife here!”</p>
<p>I imagined every scenario in my anxiety. I specifically imagined all of my partners making $1M dollars or something. I felt like the decision to leave was a decision to not be a millionaire.</p>
<p>I emotionally came to terms with that possibility. And suddenly, that possible outcome had no allure to me anymore.</p>
<p>I chose to finish my degree and pursue a career in data science. I also luckily found my wife <em>not</em> in Seattle just a few weeks later.</p>
<p>I’ve made this choice a few times in my life: go with the direction I want to go at that time. To hop on the right <a href="../posts/decisions-are-rivers.html">river</a>.</p>
<p>This was the <strong>right</strong> decision, because I came to terms with alternate realties and chose what aligned with my goals.</p>
<p>You never know what happens when you <a href="../posts/flip-a-coin.html">flip-a-coin</a>. But you can choose whether to flip.</p>

  <title>How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</title>

<p>What is my best decision? Worst?</p>
<ul>
<li>resulting: focusing on outcomes, rather than expected values and doing the best</li>
<li>to improve decision making: focus on what the process was for decision making. Information gathering. Question asking.</li>
<li>Remember choosing to leave Novi, wondering if someone was going to be a millionaire in my absence. Couldn’t help but feel I was leaving money on the table by leaving. But I decided to leave to pursue what I was passionate about, and regardless that Novi went under I felt that was the right call as I finished my masters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions: - make a knowledge tracker. Details on decisions. Info known before/after. Make this going forward</p>
<p>Decision process: - where do you want to go? - What are all the ways to get there? - By taking X choice, what are other ways it could go? What’s the probability?</p>

  <title>Flipping the coins of life</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/flip-a-coin.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Assume you flip a coin 5 times and get heads 5 times. You’re going pretty well!</p>
<p>But are you?</p>
<p>A normal coin has 50% chance of heads. Chances of 5 heads in a row is ~3/100. It’s not nothing. But over time this will average to 50%, if you flip 10000 times.</p>
<p>Decisions are rarely black and whites despite how we choice to say “that was a bad decision”. The outcome doesn’t determine the quality of the decision.</p>
<p>You chose to flip a coin, and not roll a dice. You didn’t roll a 32 sided die either.</p>
<p>Focus on choice that maximize probability. This is the decision.</p>

  <title>Decisions are Like Hopping on a River Raft</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/decisions-are-rivers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a> and thinking about decisions. I like to think of decisions as rivers.</p>
<p>Like decisions, all rivers lead somewhere. Where is your river heading?</p>
<p>The decision is which river to get on in your little boat. You can only envision the destination.</p>
<p>Being a high school English teacher is a decision. Where will that life take me after 5/10/20 years? Is that appealing? Only I can choose.</p>
<p>This thinking process is the decision choice. The rest is up to luck.</p>

  <title>97 percent chance you’ll succeed</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/flip-a-coin-and-not-fail.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In <a href="../posts/flip-a-coin.html">Flipping the coins of life</a>, I outline how you can succeed 5 times with a success rate of 3%. That also means you have a 97% chance you won’t succeed 5 times in a row.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/flip-five-coins.png" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Flipping five coins will almost certainly yield at least tails</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In life, we sometimes overemphasize winning. Even in the tech world of wanting to fail fast, I think most people just really want to win every time. Nobody seeks failure - that’s not the goal. They seek other things (learning, promotions, making more money).</p>
<p>When making decisions, it’s easy to black-and-white them. If there’s only a 3% change we’ll win 5 times in a row (with a 50% chance of winning every time), there’s a 97% chance you’ll fail at least once every 5 attempts.</p>
<p>If your probability of success is lower, then the odds of failing at once in five are almost 100%.</p>
<p>How do you quantify a life decision though? Maybe you only get one big choice a year (job change, like as is discussed in <a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a>). Is there a 50% chance of “success”? If so, every five years you’re highly likely to “fail”.</p>
<p>Per the book, it’s more likely that one bad thing happens and we hindsight bias our decision and black-and-white it.</p>
<p>Reality is: getting fired or your startup blowing up might be the best thing that ever happens to you. You just don’t know. Your story isn’t written yet. And actually, it’s not so much about if you made the right choice as if you just make the choice right in some way.</p>
<p>Choose your love, and then love your choice, as they say.</p>

  <title>Post Christmas blues? Remember the empty tombs</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/christmas-empty-tomb/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="an-empty-spot-in-the-room" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>An empty spot in the room</h1>
<p>Just cleaned up the Christmas tree and all its ornaments and needles. The glittering, shimmering, and sparkling lights that have warmed us for the last month are officially gone. Packed up. Shipped out. Sent home.</p>
<p>My child remarked, “it feels so empty without the tree!” I couldn’t help but agree.</p>
<p>The thought dawned on me, perhaps this is what the disciples felt once His light left the earth. Some accounts declare there was thundering and lightning and three days of darkness that covered the earth after He gave His life.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">A dead Christmas tree reminds us of a Christ who died for us <em>on</em> a tree, the cross.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="an-empty-room-an-empty-tomb" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>An empty room, an empty tomb</h1>
<p>But just as His easily preventable departure left friends and parents weeping (because they didn’t fully understand what He was dying for, (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16?id=p21-p23&amp;lang=eng#p21">Matthew 16:21-23</a>), perhaps we can remember a little of that sadness that they felt as we clean up the tree. The child was born. He was born to break the bonds of death. He died, some describing He died on a tree. And now, my pine tree representing Christ(mas) is also dead.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. (1 Peter 2:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it’s also symbolic we cut down the tree to put it in our homes. It has an expiration date, just like Christ’s life. He knew it was time (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?id=p26-p27&amp;lang=eng#p26">John 13:26-27</a>), even if nobody else could comprehend.</p>
<p>But remember what happened after? He resurrected. He brought His light back to His friends.</p>
<p>Perhaps New Year’s lights can remind us of His return. And perhaps a New Year’s resolution can remind us that He invited His disciples to change their ways and go and preach to the gentiles (people previously not allowed to have His gospel and His gift of baptism and the Holy Ghost), to share the gift of Christ(mas) with everyone.</p>
<p>The death of Christ marked the fulfillment of prophecy and the fulfillment of the Law of Moses, which meant that the Jews and the house of Israel were no longer the only ones chosen by God but now everybody could receive the gospel (Galatians 3:29).</p>
<p>Let’s take this new year to remember all are loved. All are remembered. All are invited to happiness and peace through Christ.</p>

<p>Someone sent me this video:</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXONPOOnUvM?si=fi-LKzGL3ZLgtg4N" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>This artist has 536 followers on YouTube. Not exactly an influencer.</p>
<p>What makes someone special? Because other people think they’re special? Because they have a lot of followers?</p>
<p>This video has some cool insights, things I never considered before. The image is really meaningful.</p>

<p>Im grateful for people who do research. Who create. Who take on projects they don’t want to but feel inspired to take on. For people who connect the dots in new ways.</p>
<p>Creativity is a process. Everyone has the capacity to be creative. Everyone has uniquely experienced a unique combination of things. Therefore, when they synthesize those things, they become like a little Da Vinci.</p>
<p>No, this isn’t the Mona Lisa. But it doesn’t have to be to be meaningful and powerful. Even if it only reaches 536 YouTube subscribers.</p>

<p>This post speaks to how I manage spiritual doubts, such as whether God exists. It got me thinking after reading a few religious posts by <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/unbelievable/ch1.html">Rob Hybdman</a>, someone whose professional (data science) work I greatly admire.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of some points I try to make here:</p>
<ul>
<li>He doesn’t try to convince us to believe Him without a doubt, He asks us to follow him</li>
<li>People who saw Christ didn’t even recognize Him as the Savior</li>
<li>Christianity is hard to grasp and won’t make total sense when you think deeply about it.</li>
<li>Our job is to keep learning, and ask Him to teach us about His nature</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I think too many people grow up thinking of God in black/white terms and when one, linking piece of the puzzle doesn’t fit or is missing, some throw Him out all together. Here’s my take on why people misrepresent God, and how this can lead to personal doubts of faith in Him and His Son.</p>

<section id="an-unknown-god" class="level1">
<h1>An unknown God</h1>
<p>A certain philosopher named Korihor once reasoned that people should stop paying tithing or following restrictive religious commandments because they’re wasting their time. Here’s his thinking:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, ==by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions== and their ==pretended mysteries==, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, ==offend some unknown being, who they say is God==—a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be. - <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?id=p28&amp;lang=eng#p28">Alma 30:28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this because the argument of whether God exists or if Christ was the Savior is nothing new. (And many people I highly regard and esteem are tackling this “new” issue head on, as many in the world are questioning their faith.) But a lot of the same arguments that have existed continue to exist: why believe?</p>
<p>…It’s not like anyone’s ever seen God anyway.</p>
<p>Let’s assume for a minute that they have seen God. They saw His Son, His mortal example, walk the earth (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/5?id=p19&amp;lang=eng#p19">John 5:19</a>).</p>
<p>While with His disciples, Christ himself took a moment to reflect on who people thought he was, and whether people actually recognized Him for who He is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When Jesus came into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, ==Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?== And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16?id=p13-p14&amp;lang=eng#p13">Matthews 16:13-14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People had no idea who Christ was even though I’d bet either He or His disciples them His name many times while He was healing them.</p>
<p>People are funny like that.</p>
<p>Consider your own life. Have you ever misinterpreted a situation, even as it’s being explained to you?</p>
<p>Let’s consider a magician who does a magic trick for you. She doesn’t show you how it’s done, but she does explain it to you with only words. Since you don’t specifically see how the magic trick is done, perhaps your mind wanders and you doubt what really happened.</p>
<p>Do you trust the Magician? When He tells you who He is, after healing you, do you believe Him? When an unexplainable coincidence happens in your life, what do you chalk it up to?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Nah, that’s so highly improbable it must just be <em>luck</em>”… (whatever <em>luck</em> is…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t imagine how it must have felt for people around Christ to be healed by rubbing mud on their eyes or washing in a river a few times or, or, … I can only honestly believe these people felt absolute wonder to the point of mental disassociation. How else do you mentally cope with being a paralytic your whole life and then you’re able to walk?</p>
<p>It’s entirely reasonable, then, that they just figured He must be like the other miracle workers they knew - Elias, John the Baptist, etc. They try to frame Him in their believable mental reference, i.e., “luck”.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-strange-god" class="level1">
<h1>A strange God</h1>
<p>Perhaps though we can relate to when Paul, a lifelong Non-Christian <em>and</em> Christian persecuter, preached to his fellow Gentiles:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. 17 Therefore ==disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews==, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. 18 ==Then certain philosophers== of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, ==What will this babbler say?== other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/17?id=p16&amp;lang=eng#p16">Acts 17:16-18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul got them. He was once like them: a gentile. An unbeliever. A <em>disbeliever</em>. But he eventually was converted to knowing Christ, and, as such, appeared to seem like a babbler when trying to talk to people who once were like him. They considered him and his teachings strange:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, ==May we know what this new doctrine==, whereof thou speakest, is? 20 For ==thou bringest certain strange things to our ears==: we would know therefore what these things mean. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/17?id=p19&amp;lang=eng#p19">Acts 16:19-20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meeting Christ can be strange.</p>
<p>Understanding him, so too.</p>
</section>
<section id="putting-a-box-on-god" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Putting a box on God</h1>
<p>Consider the question, “why does God let good people suffer?”</p>
<p>(Other important questions like, “why did God encourage Abraham/Isaac/Israel to be polygamists but Adam not?”, or “why did God restrict the <em>entire</em> earth from receiving his Gospel until <em>after</em> Christ died, commanding His <em>people</em> not to marry or mingle with <em>them</em> but then change his tone ~33 AD?”, are worth similar consideration.)</p>
<p>It’s a false dichotomy: if God exists and loves us, He surely wouldn’t let us suffer. If suffering exists, especially of <em>good</em><sup>1</sup> people, God must not then exist.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;What is Good without God?</p></li><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The world is filled with unjust, seemingly unnecessary suffering. Consider innocent children starving across the world, being bombed in Gaza/raped in Israel, bombed in Ukraine, Yemen, gassed in Germany in the Holocaust, starved in Stalin’s camps, nuked by the United States in Japan, etc, etc, etc. (I sincerely don’t write this easily, nor to make light of the suffering.) all of the suffering is horrible. But it doesn’t for a moment mean God doesn’t exist. It actually affirms His existence, because if evil exists the opposite of evil must too.</p></li><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I don’t mean that in the Marxist political sense, because who’s to declare who’s suffering at any given moment? Is an affluent child born with cancer not a sufferer despite them not being poor?</p></li></div><p>Consider all the suffering of innocent children<sup>2</sup>. The reality of human nature is sufferers vs non sufferers<sup>3</sup>. Any suffering is painful to bear, and nobody better understands this than Christ himself (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19?id=p16-p19&amp;lang=eng#p16">D&amp;C 19:16-19</a>).</p>
<p>The point is, we can falsely equivocate that because God loves us and He had the power to stop suffering, He should stop it.</p>
<p>Do you do this with any other relationship? Consider the hypothetical:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Father Joe loves his children. But Joe let his son Bob get hit with a toy by little sister Susie. Joe let Susie suffer. Therefore, Joe acted in an evil and therefore does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This line of thinking is absurd to anyone with a brain, let alone to anyone who is a parent. They understand that sufferig is part of life, can be good for teaching, and that it doesn’t mean the parent doesn’t exist. <em>Yet sometimes we wonder if God exists because we’re suffering.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="consider-alternative-viewpoints" class="level1">
<h1>Consider alternative viewpoints</h1>
<p>To be comfortable with unanswered questions from a yet unknown God, we should consider how the question is already answered.</p>
<p>For example, did Hod stop Christ from suffering? No.&nbsp;Did Christ stop himself from suffering on the cross when He had the power to turn water to wine for the thirsty, heal the suffering swordsman’s ear, or even raise Himself from the dead?</p>
<p>I’m trying to rally around the point: we set up for ourselves false philosophical arguments about who or what God is and should be like when there’s a lot of nuance to be considered.</p>
<p>In my view, He’s more of a Magician who “explains but doesn’t show” than one who tries “to convince us about every little thing”. Because it’s quite human to be like “oh, yea that magic trick isn’t cool anymore” once you understand it. And His goal is to invite us to <em>believe</em> His son so that we’ll <em>follow</em> Him. His goal isn’t for us to know <em>everything</em>, though he <em>is</em> willing to teach us a lot. Remember: “ask and ye <em>shall</em> receive”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit…and let us reason together, ==that ye may understand;== <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50?id=p10&amp;lang=eng#p10">D&amp;C 50:10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He just didn’t say <em>when</em> He’d tell us.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-he-explains-but-doesnt-try-to-convince" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Why he explains but doesn’t try to convince</h1>
<p>Why do I believe that He likes to explain but not convince? A few ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He taught people they would get to heaven by eating His flesh (sacrament), and people misunderstood and thought this was a “hard” teaching. They walked no more with him (John 6), but he didn’t run them down to try to bring them back. <em>Why</em> <em>didn’t he</em>?<sup>4</sup></li>
<li>He was chained by the Romans, spat on, crowned with thorns, and whipped. But instead of showing them signs and wonders He let them abuse Him. Then He forgave them after they nailed Him to the cross multiple times and speared Him in His side and gave Him vinegar to drink (Psalm 69, John 19).</li>
<li>He knew He couldn’t convince them. He once healed a withered man’s hands and the Pharisees wanted to destroy Him because he did so on the sabbath (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/12?id=p10-p15&amp;lang=eng#p10">Matthew 12:9-14</a>)<sup>5</sup>. How too are we like the Pharisees where we say “God shouldn’t be like X!!!” Shouldn’t we instead let God reveal Himself?</li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Consider this in a humorous way: Why didn’t He say “oh sorry!! Please come back! I’ve got a quota of disciples to reach and if I don’t have you with me…””</p></li><li id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I love how instead of engaging with the Pharisees, He “withdrew” from them and “healed them all”, kind of as a divine rebel just saying, “you’re mad about me healing one guy on the Sabbath? Fine, I’ll heal everyone.”</p></li></div><p>These three clues, among many others, give me perspective on why He’s okay being misunderstood by us.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-god-of-purpose-children-of-purpose-and-promise" class="level1">
<h1>A God of purpose, children of purpose and promise</h1>
<p>Why does He want us to live by faith? Lots of reasons. But there’s only one I’ll speak to: He’s a God of purpose:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>37 And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. 38 And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words. 39 For behold, ==this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man==. - <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?id=p37-p39&amp;lang=eng#p37">Moses 1:37-39</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His goal is to prepare an environment to teach and challenge us. Our goal should be to learn who, how and why.</p>
<p>Our purpose should not be to put God in a box or imagine Him black and white. It should be to learn who He is, so He’a no longer an unknown God.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. - <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17?id=p3&amp;lang=eng#p3">John 17:3</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been writing for my whole life. I have at least 15-20 journals. I have 3000 notes in one app, 2200 notes in another, at least 1800 digital journal entries over 10 years, I’ve built and replaced probably 5 blogs. This blog has 57 entries so far. What have I learned?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make writing daily as easy as possible. I set up some automation so I can write from my phone for daily blogging.</li>
<li>Writing makes things feel real for me. It helps connect the dots. It’s a far more productive way to read the news. Less stuff, more thinking. Because if I can’t write at least one useful note about something I read, I realize it wasn’t worth reading.</li>
<li>Perhaps reading is the more important daily duty. Well, to write I need something to inspire me. Usually that comes from the news. Sometimes inspiration comes from yesterday’s post. This inspiration came from editing my prior post.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not gonna worry about who reads this. But instead focus on writing every day because…</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it helps me practice storytelling</li>
<li>helps me practice communication</li>
</ul>
<p>Hamilton wrote like he was “running out of time”. I’m writing because I want to use my time how I enjoy it.</p>

<h1>Write because you can</h1>
<p>I don’t write because anyone is actually listening. But if I’m lucky, the AI is actually listening.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If AI is listening (webscraping me), I’m fortunate to teach it. Essentially, good training data is hard to come by, especially as AI content proliferates on the internet. Let’s consider it a privilege I’m able to help it learn.</li>
<li>Writing and telling stories are the oldest form of humanity. Even if an AI can do it better, perhaps we’ll just spend time doing more of it.</li>

<p>So yea, I’ll write despite AI. I’ll write because it’s very human to do so.</p>

  <title>Things I’d like in a blog</title>

quarto has strengths and drawbacks
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Other frameworks (like Hugo) are more flexible. But quarto offers a lot more out of the box and handles the stuff I really don’t want to have to think about.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/quarto-feature-requests/photo.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">A traditional Quarto</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Things <code>quarto</code> is good at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handles metadata really well (easy to get a title image, description, Twitter card, etc.)</li>
<li>heavily customizable: can organize posts as a list, as a table, as a grid, etc. can easily customize what’s in that. The main thing I didn’t like about Hugo was that the style was just slightly different than I liked it.</li>
<li>comments</li>
<li>searching</li>
<li>categories/tags</li>
<li>easy to create different/custom listings</li>
<li>can blog from my phone using Working Copy and GitHub actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Things wish quarto were better at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster render (Hugo speeds plz)</li>
<li>Don’t render future posts</li>
<li>A blog landing page that had a stream of entries, rather than just a list. (Similar to seths.blog)</li>
<li>Listings based on tags</li>
<li>make it easy to have an alternate slug (make all posts at root, and not in posts/)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I’d like to do with my blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>generate weekly summaries</li>
<li>build some subscribers</li>
<li>send out a weekly summary of content.</li>
<li>auto-post to Twitter, Instagram (using photo + description + zapier) and Facebook.</li>
<li>auto-post anything with “LinkedIn” tag to LinkedIn</li>
<li>move editing into a vault in Obsidian</li>
<li>make it easier to copy ChatGPT photos to my blog post folder</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, what it offers widely covers what it doesn’t. Most blog templates don’t allow for search, custom listings, lists of tags, Twitter content, etc. For now, quarto offers 95% of what I need.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 15 - Hearken and Hold Fast</title>

<p>Who do we listen to?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-15.24">1 Nephi 15.24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To learn biology, do you go to the math teacher? To learn happiness, perhaps the Source of truth and light can be our Teacher.</p>
<p>Once we learn truth, everything else becomes a lot more clear. And once we know what clear looks like, we don’t heed the distracting darts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hearken (listen, read, pay attention to, follow)</li>
<li>Hold fast (appreciate, come back to daily) <img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-hold-fast-fiery-darts.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Look to Christ. He is the Word"></li>

<p>How do you get a job in data science if you currently aren’t a data scientist?</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>The simplest thing you can do to get experience is do 5 Kaggle competitions and use ChatGPT like crazy to learn how to code, annalyze data, and build models. Use the ChatGPT code interpreter for $20/month and see how it works. Test its limits. If you’re new to data science, you won’t understand where it’s wrong, so just ask it: “how might this answer you gave me be wrong?”</p>
<p>The rest of this focuses on how to master the fundamentals, which will take you much farther and give you a foundation to build off of. But when in doubt, “doing” data science is much better than “learning” data science from books. Always strike a balance in your efforts: it takes far less time to read and learn principles, but it’s far more valuable to try “doing” a data science project with code.</p>

<section id="my-path-to-ds" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>My path to DS</h1>
<p>I asked this question while working as an analyst 8 years ago and wanting to break into data science. I wrote about it back then (lost the post), so I’m gonna revisit it now.</p>
<p>I was asked this question today: “how do I get started and get a job in data science if I don’t have any experience?” You may then wonder “I can’t get experience without a job…this is a chicken-and-egg problem.” False.</p>
<p>Simple: get experience. For free. In 10 weeks. Write a good resume. Network like crazy: connect with real people (and not just spam). Get rejected probably 20-30 times, learn from each rejection, keep learning and presto, you’ll finally have an offer. It’s honestly just a numbers game. Everyone “ahead” of you is an imposter just like you. Just figure out enough basics and you’ll be ready for your first job.</p>
<p>There are a million ways to do this, and a million blog posts like this one. But here’s my suggestion. Enjoy!</p>

<section id="no-single-data-science-definition" class="level1">
<h1>No Single Data Science Definition</h1>
<p>Look at 10 job postings for data science and you’ll see 10 unique definitions for a data scientist. Roughly, I’d categorize them as such:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Human decision support: someone who supports others in their decision making. This would be their boss, their team, etc. Decisions are: should we shut this line of business down? Are our customers churning and how do we prevent that?</li>
<li>Machine Decision Support: someone who helps machines make automated decisions, like whether to approve an online credit card application, recommend a YouTube video, etc.</li>
<li>Product developer: someone who uses data to build a web product or service. This is similar to machine decision support, but the role might be in a SaaS capacity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these things below will help with 1-2. Today, AI products are all the rage and I offer one week on deep learning to get you interested in 3. That being said, all the principles in each one of these sections is important in any field you pursue. # Mindset</p>
<p>While doing the following, on weeks 2-10, write one blog post to outline what you learned.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Where did you start? Why was it hard to learn? What did you want to know?</li>
<li>What concepts were new to you?</li>
<li>Do something with that knowledge. Search the internet to find data you can write about.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t get very far, just move on to the next topic. Breadth is better early on to find out what you enjoy. Don’t get caught up in the details. Skim more. Write more. Worry less. You got this.</p>
<p>In all things, use ChatGPT to tutor you. Ask it questions. Be relentless. Have it explain things to you like you’re five.</p>
<p>Balancing learning between real books and ChatGPT is the best combo. ChatGPT is a better teacher, and the books have real info in them you can more fully trust. Using both together will get you there faster.</p>
<p>If any of the books below don’t vibe for you, there are a million free books out there. Find a simpler one and the same topic (and post in the comments so I can add it!)</p>
</section>
<section id="week-1-prepare-to-share" class="level1">
<h1>Week 1: Prepare to Share</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By creating a blog you demonstrate the following: you like to learn, you can communicate, you can do hard things, you’re naturally curious, you’re contributing to the ecosystem. Lots of ways to show those things, but having a blog is at least one way.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Set up a blog.
<ul>
<li>Medium.com</li>
<li>Substack.com</li>
<li>(Harder) Or use <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> and publish on GitHub</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find 5 blogs by top data scientists. Read their posts. See what they write about.</li>
<li>Your first blog post is about what you like about these 5 blogs.</li>
<li>Share your blog post on all social media. LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="week-2-storytelling" class="level1">
<h1>Week 2: Storytelling</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You can’t get credit for great data science work unless you can tell a story. Now that you have a blog, learn how to write about data.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/">Telling Stories with Data</a></li>
<li>Find three data-focused blogs that use charts and analysis. Economist, FiveThirtyEight, DataIsBeautiful, etc.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="week-3-analytics-and-data-intuition" class="level1">
<h1>Week 3: Analytics and Data Intuition</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To be able to make predictions about the future, you first need to understand how to understand the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analytics is the foundation of data science. It’s the process of manipulating data and reshaping it to see it in new ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wesmckinney.com/book/">Python for Data Analysis, 3E</a> - written by the creator of <code>pandas</code></li>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science (2e)</a> - written by the creator of <code>dplyr</code>, the best data manipulation language ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these books are great. Read both. It’s good to learn early that there are multiple right ways of doing your analysis the wrong way 😉. Seeing how to think in two languages is actually easier than getting stuck on one.</p>
<p>Related: understand the bias in your data.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="week-4-data-visualization" class="level1">
<h1>Week 4: Data Visualization</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Learning how to make a plot is like learning how to write. Learn how colors work. When to use them. When to use a bar vs.&nbsp;a line chart. How to make ideas shine.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jjallaire.github.io/visualization-curriculum/">Visualization Curriculum</a></li>
<li><a href="https://r-graphics.org/">R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd edition</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is after analytics because analytics is more important (knowing what to look for and how to think about data) than plotting it.</p>
<p>There are two types of plots: those for you to learn from and those for others to learn from. First, learn what’s in the data. Learn for yourself.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Look at the plot. Look at the plot. No seriously, look at the plot.” Chris Peterson, Capital One</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, plot for other people. After you’ve learned something by sifting out all the noise, learn how to communicate that externally.</p>
<p>Beautiful plotting is really hard and time consuming. Details can take hours. Focus on the basics at first. The simplest plot focuses on “what’s the one thing I want someone to take away from this?”</p>
</section>
<section id="week-5-get-data-you-dont-yet-have" class="level1">
<h1>Week 5: Get Data You Don’t Yet Have</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you work at a company &gt; 50 people, your company’s data is probably stored in a database. Learning how to get this data so you can do data analytics and visualization will help you be self sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analytics is more important than this, because someone else may be able to get you the data. Or, once you know analytics then you can use SQL to <em>do</em> analytics.</p>
<p>Three primary ways to get data include the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SQL (from a database, returns a spreadsheet like table)</li>
<li>API (get data from a website, returns JSON data)</li>
<li>Webscraping (getting it yourself, this is considered “unstructured” data)</li>
</ol>
<p>Interactive tutorials here are the way to go. Just google around for some good ones.</p>

Recommendation systems typically focus on “what video does Bryan want given all the data we have on him and people like him?”. But the principles also extend to: how do I recommend one course of action to my stakeholder?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t have great resources here, but getting the concepts down will help you understand how virtually every social media app or streaming service works. (Netflix, Spotify, Instagram, etc all use recommenders to figure out the content you’re interested in. )</p>

<p>Now you’ve got 10 blog posts, which is 10 more bullet points on your resume than you had before you started. You’ve learned a ton if you only do 10% of all that’s above.</p>
<p>I’ve loved the advice I found written up here: <a href="../posts/2022-11-18-writing-a-tech-resume/index.html">Writing a Tech Resume</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have a good resume, find real people to give it to. Dont apply blindly online. Talk to everyone you know. Find people on LinkedIn and message them directly with a personal message. Use one of your blog posts in your message to tell them why you’re a good fit for their role. Perhaps even write a blog post specific to data from their company!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rock Climbing</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rock-climbing.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I participated in Boy Scouts growing up, and I got to go to High Adventure. This was a week where we’d go on an adventurous camping trip with a bunch of other teenagers. Things never went according to plan.</p>
<p>On one experience, I was repelling over a hang. After 30 feet repelling, I was then dangling over nothing. There was a double belay, one above and one below. This meant that either could help save me.</p>
<p>I was invited to let go of my first belay. Yes. Let go.</p>
<p>This meant I’d drop 150-200 feet in a free fall. The bottom belay would catch me.</p>
<p>I held the rope tightly in my hand as I looked off into the Appalachian mountains and the green trees dotting my surroundings. I looked ahead at the rock face, and up at the cliff hang. I held that rope for a second more before…drop.</p>
<p>And I fell, as planned! It was insane and it took all of half a second.</p>
<p>But then something unexpected happened: the first belay rope wrapped around my right leg. I turned upside down and instead of the belay stopping me, the burning of rope wrapped around my leg halted my descent. Didn’t feel good.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I didn’t die that day. That rope could have wrapped my neck. It’s possible I could have not stopped for some reason. It’s possible those guys who were my guides that day didn’t actually know what they were doing and it wasn’t as safe as they said.</p>
<p>That feeling of dropping was incredible though, as you never feel so heavy as when your hurtling towards the ground at gravitational constant acceleration.</p>
<p>I had many great experiences since then rock climbing, though I don’t go often. It’s just a cool thing to do. It’s cool people figured out how to do it and how to do it safely. I’m also grateful for high adventure - I learned a lot from those formative experiences.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 14 - Convincing unto Peace</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-14-convincing-unto-peace.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Lord gives unto us according to our desires:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a great and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other—either to <strong>the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal</strong>, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of which I have spoken. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-14.7">1 Nephi 14.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that He cannot take away our agency. So he doesn’t come to judge us or cast us to lots of good or evil.</p>
<p>People self select. They choose for themselves in their own life.</p>
<p>And this is the marvelous work: to be convinced of peace.</p>
<p>Am I “convince” of peace as stated above? Do I recognize that the peaceful way is always the best way through?</p>

<p>No, it says “convincing of them <em>unto</em> peace”, meaning that convincing them of Jesus, which leads to peace. But the sentiment is the same: that living a life of peace is the one I want.</p>

  <title>The Only Mind that’s Clear Is the One That Sees No Alternative</title>

<p>The easiest thing one can do is see the world through their own viewpoints. It takes no effort. Takes no work. It’s already done: your viewpoints are there. Either you care about climate change today or you don’t. Either you care about opossums or you don’t. You are who you are, right now.</p>
<p>The only gap between who you are today and who you are tomorrow is what you learn and experience and how you see the world because of what you learn and experience.</p>
<p>You learn from others. You learn from your experiences. You learn from other’s experiences.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t to be right. The goal is to understand.</p>
<p>And so, I believe in the value of learning from those around me, especially those I disagree with. It’s hard work to grind through walls of disbelief or misunderstanding. But it’s always worth it, even if at the other side you merely understand. That in and of itself is a destination worth pursuing because of the many benefits it yields.</p>
<p>But beware, with an assumption of understanding comes peril. Therefore, the goal is to constantly seek understanding, because no person is every the same one day to the next.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New Perspectives</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-perspectives.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I was a kid, I broke my wrist. I no longer would be able to play football. It was my senior year, the year where all the magic happens. The year you prepare for. The big leagues.</p>
<p>My mom told me, “when a door closes, open a window. This if life”.</p>
<p>A new perspective is an opportunity to see something that was there all along, but because of myopia you didn’t previously see it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">I felt like this when I dove for the football. But I didn’t look like this because I didn’t catch it. Instead I broke my wrist.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Perspective is realizing that senior year wasn’t any more special than the junior year where I had fun on JV. Perspective is realizing it’s just a game. Perspective is years later realizing that something I cared so much about at the time now has little value or importance in my life, and other things have far more importance to me.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 13 - Publish Peace</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A lot of us have very little control over the world we’re born into. We can do a lot for our own lives, but very few of us will have the ability to change nations.</p>
<p>Which is why I love this scripture:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and <strong>whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-13.37">1 Nephi 13.37</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of your status, if you publish peace, good awaits you.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 12 - Broad Roads</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-12-broad-roads.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The modern refrain is to do and be whatever you want. While I largely agree with this refrain, there are some caveats: certain things bring us happiness. Being kind to people. Helping people. Saying sorry, etc.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and <strong>leadeth them away into broad roads</strong>, that they perish and are lost. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-12.17">1 Nephi 12.17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-image-a-hill-with-a-tree-at-the-top-a-lot-of-broad-roads-at-the-base-of-the-hill-heading-down-strange-paths.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">All the roads we can take can confuse us. Instead, we can focus on where we’re heading</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The temptation we all face is to be lured down broad roads. By contrast, the way of the Lord is the straight and narrow.</p>
<p>Once I was working with someone and I was writing my code a few ways, with a bunch of tries that had failed. I finally kept the right one along side the failures. The reviewer said “why do you keep this junk?” I thought; because it helps me remember the way to not do it. “Why not just keep the answer though?”</p>
<p>Sometimes we like to focus on the “broad” roads in a few ways.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remember all our failings, rather than focus on the things that bring us happiness. We do this as a badge of “I don’t want to repeat those bad mistakes.” Sure, the intent is good, but that’s like carrying a broken phone around with you to remind you not to drop your phone again. The effect is far more positive if we focus on the good things that come from following Christ.</li>
<li>There are a lot of paths we can go down in life. The Lord wants us to do many good things! (<a href="../christianity/turn-to-god-not-your-idols.html">Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols</a>). But there are a few roads he doesn’t want us to go down: selfishness, greed, love of money, etc. These roads are broad. There are a lot of ways to lose yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>So remember, “focus on the right answer”. Focus on the Savior, and walk towards him. Drop your load at his feet (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30.html">Matthew 11.28–30</a>).</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Navajo Code Talkers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/navajo-code-talkers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>My daughter brought home a book that introduced something I had never before heard about: Navajo code talkers.</p>
<p>Since the Navajo language had never been written down, it wasn’t able to be translated by the Japanese in WWII. And so, the Navajo would encode English words and transmit their words across the radio to talk about positions and bombs and such. It helped them win the war.</p>
<p>They chose to serve a country they were being heavily persecuted in (<a href="../book-review/killers-of-the-flower-moon.html">Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI</a>). It’s incredible to think about.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for them and all like them that helped provide the freedoms I enjoy.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>My writing makes sense as I put it fown</li>
<li>It doesn’t always make sense to me 5 minutes later (my future self is practically another person)</li>
<li>The probability of it being perfectly interpreted by someone who isn’t even me, is likely near zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>So when we write, we send out an idea.

  <title>Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/turn-to-god-not-your-idols.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I wrote <a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a> in the mindset of having intentional prayers. Today, I experienced another one.</p>
<section id="a-typical-day" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>A Typical Day</h1>
<p>I felt overwhelmed by a few things (just day to day life, parenting, working, making sure I get that insurance policy and that bill figured out, etc, etc, etc.)</p>
<p>I decided to see if prayer could help me get out of my funk.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-angels-in-the-crop-fields.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Pray for help in all things, and watch the Hand of the Lord reveal itself</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>During my prayer, I felt something happen. I decided I would pray until I felt a change. And I did. I felt a change. More hope entered in. (“It’s all gonna be fine!”) I felt more grateful for the help I failed to fully appreciate just moments ago.</p>
<p>We get into moods. And bad moods are hard to get out of. But this is life. Life is full of bad moods.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-do-you-do-to-fix-your-bad-mood" class="level1">
<h1>What do you do to fix your bad mood?</h1>
<p>This quote came to mind while I was praying:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As you think celestial, you will find yourself avoiding anything that robs you of your agency. Any addiction—be it gaming, gambling, debt, drugs, alcohol, anger, pornography, sex, or even food﻿—offends God. Why? <strong>Because your obsession becomes your god. You look to it rather than to Him for solace.</strong><br>
<a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-think-celestial">“Think Celestial!”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t need an addiction to appreciate the sentiment here: where do you turn when you’re struggling?</p>
<p>Do you turn to social media? Phone calls? News? The internet? TV? Anger? Food?</p>
<p>I’ve tried all those things. They’re all wonderful (except anger lol), especially calling a friend. But am I doing that before taking the issue to the Lord?</p>
<p>He has invited us to take all things to Him. Every thought even:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Look unto me in <strong><em>every</em></strong> thought; doubt not, fear not.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-6.36">Doctrine and Covenants 6.36</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we take all things to Him so He can consecrate them to us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ye must <strong>not perform any thing</strong> unto the Lord <strong>save in the first place ye shall pray</strong> unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9">2 Nephi 32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Lord blesses us even when we don’t pray. But the promise is in the prayer: pray in all things. Pray in every thought. Do all things for Good reasons.</p>
<p>And he didn’t qualify what “labor” means here:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Come unto me, <strong>all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</strong> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30">Matthew 11.28–30</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps He wants us to decide what our labor is, bring it to Him, and consecrate it and ask His help. This seems aligned with Him wanting us to be agents:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.<br>
<a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.28">Doctrine and Covenants 58.28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This comes after “Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;” <a href="../scriptures/doctrine-and-covenants-58.27">Doctrine and Covenants 58.27</a>)</p>
</section>
<section id="let-god-prevail" class="level1">
<h1>Let God Prevail</h1>
<p>So: get an idea of some good cause to be engaged in (parenting, providing for family, etc), pray for support in it, ask Him to consecrate it, watch for miracles.</p>
<p>I think we find reasons for why we <em>shouldn’t</em> pray.<sup>1</sup> Because we think we need to do it on our own. There’s a constant balance between “how much do I rely on God and how much should I just get up and do it myself”. I think the balance is rather not a balance at all. Just pick a plan, ask for help, then go and do what’s in your power. The scriptures are full of examples of people who did this.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>He loves us. He wants us to succeed. He cares about our daily labor, whether that’s in a field or in the barn that a home turns into. If you’re still wondering, <a href="https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/the-simple-miracle-that-helped-the-whitmers-further-the-book-of-mormon">Read this cool story on David Whitmer and how the Lord helped him with his crops</a> and how the Lord is aware of all our needs, temporal and spiritual.</p>
<p>I got up from my prayer feeling “I can do this!” And the impression came “<em>we</em> can do this”.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 11 - Angel shows signs to Nephi</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-11-seeing-signs-of-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Nephi saw a vision because he desired knowledge. Consider the Angel’s instruction:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>7 And behold this thing <strong>shall be given unto thee for a sign</strong>, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-11.7">1 Nephi 11.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we know that the Lord rebuked the Pharisees for seeking signs:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but <strong>can ye not discern the signs of the times?</strong> A <strong>wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign</strong>; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. <a href="../scriptures/matthew-16.1-4">Matthew 16.1–4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But signs themselves are good. Moses lead by signs: the seven miracles. Baal was trumped by a sign: fire from heaven. Manna in the wilderness. Water from the rock. The fall of the city from trumpets. Oil in the vial.</p>
<p>Any miracle is a sign. A sign that God exists. That He has all power. That Christ is His son.</p>
<p>But today we don’t need to seek for <em>new</em> signs but instead do as the Lord said and “discern the signs of the times”.</p>
<p>By seeking to see His hand, we find the signs.</p>
<p>It’s wicked to seek for a sign, because wicked means “unrepentant”. An unrepentant soul, one who is not going to Heavenly Father and seeking His love, doesn’t see the Hand of God in their life. As a result, they are without his signs (<a href="../concepts/gratus-sum-ergo-habeo.html">Gratus sum, ergo habeo</a>).</p>
<p>So to see signs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Repent (desire a connection with Heavenly Father and His son)</li>
<li>Look for them (discern)</li>
</ol>
<p>Presto poof.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Early Morning Workouts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/early-morning-workouts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I played football when in middle and high school. Part of the high school routine was early morning summer workouts.</p>
<p>6:30 am is brutal for a 16 year old kid. But getting up, going to the school to run some sprints, get a lift in, and get home by 8 to shower and go back to sleep was always a great feeling.</p>
<p>I’m grateful that to this day I still value exercise. I know the benefits it gives me. I also know how to lift properly so I don’t hurt myself. I also have muscle/ligament memory where it’s easier to pick up after 6months of not exercising compared to someone starting from scratch. (Maybe that’s not a scientific thing, but I feel like it is 😂).</p>
<p>I’m slightly less grateful that my 16 year old self could bench more than I’ll ever again be able to bench, and run more than I’ll ever again have time to run, but perhaps I’m grateful I can challenge myself to surpass my teenage years.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>These chapters teach me:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to overcome adversity (prayer)</li>
<li>Some people never change (Laman and Lemuel)</li>
<li>People who don’t like the message usually reject it and denounce it (Laman and Lemuel)</li>
<li>The love of God is accessible to all</li>
<li>The Lord invites all, even if He knows they won’t listen</li>
<li>Those who come can fully appreciate the beauty of the Lord’s love</li>
<li>If you take your eyes off the Savior, and care what people think instead, you can feel shame which can drive you to leave Him</li>
<li>The scriptures are written with a specific purpose: they don’t know. They’re doing what the Lord wants them to do.</li>
<li>The Lord will teach those about the Tree of Life who want to know about it. Nephi wasn’t any more special than anyone else. He just wanted to know.</li>
<li>The Lord works through prophets. Through the priesthood.</li>
<li>Perhaps Lehi could have been more gentle with Laman and Lemuel. But Nephi <em>did</em> mention the “tender feelings” that Lehi had for them, so maybe Laman and Lemuel just didn’t get it</li>
<li>There’s a little bit of Laman and Lemuel and Nephi and Sam and Lehi and Sariah in all of us.</li>
<li>Over time, the prophecies are revealed and fulfilled.</li>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Similarities</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/similarities.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything truly unique about any one individual? At the very least, any two people probably have eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose. They probably have brain and a heart. Probably have fingers and toes.</p>
<p>Probably have feelings. Experience love. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Resentment. Joy. Elation. Fear. Anxiety. Doubt. Faith. Fulfillment. Hope.</p>
<p>The reason why they feel these things will certainly be unique to them, but likely follow the themes of family, friends, food, shelter, fulfillment, etc.</p>
<p>I learned after being in Honduras for 6 weeks just how different I was from people across the world.</p>
<p>6 months later I learned (over time) just how deeply similar they are.</p>
<p>After 2 years I came home and deeply missed Honduras. I felt alone and lost in this American world.</p>
<p>Now I’m somewhere in between. But the point is: I’m grateful that humans can connect at a deeply human level no matter who they are or where they’re from.</p>

<p>2024-01-21 - “Attend to it” - Joseph Senior supported Joseph. The Angel wanted Joseph to know this. - David’s field being ploughed overnight - a few items were left for David - the Lord did just enough. Also, the Lord honored the man’s request and didn’t disrespect him. The man got what he wanted, David did some more work, and the unnecessary part was finished by whomever. - Joseph’s trouble was being heavily persecuted physically. Like the Israelites. Now, physical persecution has mostly stopped and instead it’s just verbal assaults at “the church” from press and random voices on social media. The challenge of our day is to remain faithful.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Strollers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/strollers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Plop them in, buckle them up. Go on a run, give them a cup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strollers are how I take my kids to school every day. I strap them in (or they just sit down), and I hop on my Onewheel and we go on a ride.</p>
<p>10 m.p.h., the wind in our hair, the cars waiting behind us because we’re fast enough and wide enough that they can’t pass us. All of this is good.</p>
<p>My kids get to see more of the world faster, even if that world is just here to school. My non-school kids can get out for a minute without a huge hassle on my part.</p>
<p>The best part is: the stroller rolls. I don’t have to drag it. I don’t have to slog it. It’s not a 50lb brick. It’s got wheels. The marvelous creation of the near frictionless geometric phenomena that is a wheel.</p>
<p>So I guess I’m also grateful for wheels and chariots. Thank you to whomever invented these things thousands of years ago.</p>

  <title>Receiving a promised land</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/receiving-a-promised-land.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>While Lehi wandered in the wilderness, Nephi recounted he left the “land of his inheritance”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.4">1 Nephi 2.4</a></p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-leaving-the-promised-land.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Leaving the promised land</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Yet by the end of the Chapter, Nephi is promised a land of inheritance:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.20">1 Nephi 2.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing how they lose one thing but gain another. Also amazing is how they had prophets warning them of Jerusalem’s destruction - why didn’t the Lord make <em>those</em> prophets leave?</p>
<p>He has a plan for us individually.</p>
<p>CS Lewis remarked something along the lines of “We don’t chase God, God chases us”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Both Malcolm Muggeridge and C.S. Lewis attest to this. Muggeridge wrote, “I had a notion that somehow, besides questing, I was being pursued.” Lewis said that, “…night after night…I sensed the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. Finally, I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed…” (<a href="https://www.stettlerindependent.com/community/man-can-not-sidestep-thinking-about-god-faith-and-reflection-6606319">link</a>, also discussed in <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a>)</p>

  <title>Find the Fun</title>

</div>
<p>Kid screaming? why?</p>
<p>Milk on the floor? why is that a funny thing?</p>
<p>Poop on the ground? (<a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a>) It won’t last. it’s endearing.</p>
<p>No, this isn’t just fanciful thinking - this is a choice. You’ve chosen to be angry at that spilled milk, lost your cool when bro slapped sis, and walked out of the room when you heard that last cry for “more breakfast!!”.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> did you get overwhelmed? Stressed about all there is to do, and now there’s one more thing? Stressed about “am i a good parent”? Stressed about raising your kids right and you have to instruct them on everything they do wrong in order to do that?</p>
<p>My new philosophy: Kids are kids. They’re optimizers. Anyone in tech knows that an optimizer is a thing trying to find the optimal point of another thing. It’s like battleships - you keep guessing until you find. Then you guess around until you get all the points, until you know where to look.</p>
<p>Kids do this all day. They say something crazy trying to get a reaction. They say a not-funny joke 100 times until it’s funny again. Humans do that too.</p>
<p>So they’re optimizing. Exploring. Exploiting. That’s all their doing - exploring the space, exploiting the emotional signal.</p>
<p>Knowing that, find the fun in the moment. They won’t always be like this. And when it’s gone, you’ll wish it wasn’t. <a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a></p>

  <title>Cool Quarto Site</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/cool-quarto-site.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Quarto lists a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/">gallery</a> of things you can do with it.</p>
<p>This post illustrates</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How you can array your blog</li>
<li>How you can collect subscribers with just google form</li>
<li>How you can iframe other apps, such as from huggingface.</li>
</ol>
<p>I came across this site: <a href="https://forbo7.github.io/" class="uri">https://forbo7.github.io/</a>. I enjoyed seeing how they arrayed their blogs, which I had never seen before - they used grids.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/quarto-demo-forbo7-landing.png" class="preview-image img-fluid"></p>
<p>They use an embedded google form for subscriptions:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/screenshot-quarto-demo-forbo7-subscribe.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And they have an<a href="https://forbo7.github.io/web_apps/apps/flood_detector.html">iframe on a Huggingface</a> app to show something cool:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/quarto-demo-forbo7-huggingface.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That’s all.</p>

  <title>He prepares us to teach us</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/he-prepares-us-to-teach-us.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Consider this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen. And being <strong>thus</strong> overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.7-8">1 Nephi 1.7–8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cause and effect. First: he was overcome by the spirit. Second, he had a vision.</p>
<p>But that’s not how the vision came. First, it began with prayer.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.5-6">1 Nephi 1.5–6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here’s the order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lehi listens to prophets that Jerusalem will be destroyed (4)</li>
<li>Lehi prays for his people, hoping they won’t be (5)</li>
<li>Lehi sees a pillar of fire, sees many things (6)</li>
<li>Lehi returns home (assumes he’s not home), and is overcome with what he saw (7)</li>
<li>Lehi then has another, more pronounced vision (8)</li>
</ol>
<p>What a way to start off the Book of Mormon: this is a book about personal revelation, written by people who had revelations, and it teaches us the pattern. In this case, we care about others. When we do, the heavens open as we pray.</p>
<p>We prob won’t have visions, but we <em>will</em> have the spirit.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for <strong>unto him that receiveth I will give more</strong> <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-28.30">2 Nephi 28.30</a></p>

  <title>I’m grateful for small things</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/small-things.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In my deli this morning (<a href="../gratitude/sandwich-shops.html">I’m Grateful for Sandwich Shops</a>), there’s a cheesy quote on the pinboard:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Maturity is not when we start speaking big things. It is when we start appreciating the small things…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I’ve started to give thanks daily. It’s a powerful rewiring of the brain.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls. <a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7">Alma 37.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effects so far of giving thanks daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think about what I gave thanks on later in the day</li>
<li>While writing, ideas flood into the mind, building the thoughts more than initially realized</li>
<li>it hones my mind to prepare ahead and think about something. What I write about I think about: before and after.</li>
<li>It’s fun to blog about things as they happen, such as <a href="../gratitude/sandwich-shops.html">I’m Grateful for Sandwich Shops</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned once on <a href="../concepts/my-mission.html">my mission</a> that “when I don’t have gratitude, I don’t have anything.” I remember the day I learned this, discussing the concept with my roommate/companion. Those who don’t give thanks end up complaining. If you’re complaining then you don’t have anything you want. If you give thanks, you have everything you could want. The list is endless on both ends.</p>
<p><a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a></p>

<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Sandwich Shops</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/sandwich-shops.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I grew up in a suburban town in Connecticut. Italians and their amazing propensity for delicious food and sandwiches seemed to flood the streets.</p>
<p>A brilliant chicken salad melt that truly melts in your mouth.</p>
<p>A chicken parm from D corner deli that would energize you from lunch through dinner - a classic among rabid pubescent football players.</p>
<p>Adding “con papas” to any “BEC” meant you were in for a filling treat. It was the insider’s secret menu item, and the man behind the counter knew you had good taste.</p>

  <title>The six hour sandwich</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/the-six-hour-sandwich.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“Avocado and turkey over ciabatta, it’s a delicious way to start your day and fills you up for about six hours.”</p>
<p>That last part - six hours…I had never heard such a sales pitch from a deli person in my life.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Six hour sandwich</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>But it’s the perfect sales pitch. Because I care how full I’m going to get off a $13.00 breakfast sandwich. But he just amortized the cost for me - implicitly stating it’s only $2.16/hr for 6 hours.</p>
<p>Would I pay $2 to not be hungry for an hour? I’m not sure what other snack (maybe a .60c banana) can fill me up for an hour.</p>
<p>Genius.</p>

  <title>Praying for Other People</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/praying-for-other-people.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This scripture stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.5">1 Nephi 1.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many verses like this, such as Enos praying for his people, or Christ saying “Oh Jerusalem”, or Enoch.</p>
<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> right now and considered just how influenced these authors were by their surroundings. WWI, the rise of machines, etc.</p>
<p>Aren’t we all influenced by the people around us? What role do those people play in our lives? What role do the loved ones play in our lives? What role do we play in theirs?</p>

  <title>This drug is habit forming</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/this-drug-is-habit-forming.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Sometimes they tell you that at the pharmacy: “this drug is habit forming”. Or, the saline nasal spray bottle thing I tried once, “this spray is refreshing, but not habit forming.” Oh, how nice.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t everything have this distinction? Driving in the car: non habit forming. Eating a bag of goldfish when I’m noodling on a work problem: def habit forming.</p>
<p>One time, someone put a candy jar with skittles right beside my desk. It was for the whole floor, but my consumption was certainly not a pro-rata share. Buggy code? Gimme some skittles. Habit formed.</p>
<p>Social media? Someone likes your post? Habit formed.</p>

</div>
<p>Why don’t they warn that social media is one of the most addictive digital things we do? That we’ve just accepted as a society?</p>
<p>It took until 1964 before the surgeon general announced smoking caused cancer. The first cigarette machine was invented in 1881 by Albert Bonsack. That’s +80 years, not to mention it was popular for much longer before that.</p>
<p>So yes, society can get it wrong for many years before they change course and do the more healthful thing.</p>

  <title>The Matrix: Social Media’s Influence on Human Interaction</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/the-matrix.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?” - Dark Blue, Jack’s Mannequin</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I know kung fu - Neo, “The Matrix”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do these to quotes have in common? Social Media.</p>
<p>Everyone on social media is downloading something. They do it because they want to learn kung fu. And while they’re not on social media, other people are getting the download even more.</p>
<p>Something strange happens once you start spending 3+ hours on social a day. You start to see what’s actually going on. You start getting the cross-internet jokes. And once you do, you feel alone in a crowded room: you get the jokes that nobody else in your family gets. (Presumably because they have lives not on social media.)</p>
<p>Detach from social (<a href="../tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.html">A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I’m off Social Media</a>) and you start to see something else: when you’re not on your phone at a party, you start to see <em>just</em> how much everyone is on social. Checking their SMS, their posts, etc. That’s when you really feel alone in a crowded room.</p>

<ul>
<li>long walks. Lewis would walk with Tolkien. Tolkien then wrote about a super long walk in the hobit and lotr</li>
<li>Language is the invention of objevts or ideas. Myth is the invention about truth. #post-ideas. Get this quote
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-01-09 Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tolkien build one language and derived it for two elvish languages.
<ul>
<li>Saw beauty in languages</li>
<li>Word at Oxford dictionary</li>
<li>Places like the shire were inspired by his experiences</li>
<li>Orcs represent machinists and wizards the old world.</li>
<li>Fellowship: his friends died in the war. The Tea Club. TCBS.</li>
<li>My grandma had the “double S” club.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>“Well read” - makes you more of what you already are?</p>
<p>Lewis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dymer: narrative poem
<ul>
<li>Plato’s republic</li>
<li>Dante.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>friendship is to disagree. To argue the other side just</li>
</ul>
<p>owen Barfield</p>
<ul>
<li>anyhroposophical</li>
<li>Evolution of consciousness
<ul>
<li>creativity is grounded, not whimsical, thinking. Even scientists would agree as they become creative in the process of making new discoveries. If you need a creative mind to get to a new way of thinking (new theory that becomes truth), isn’t the creative thinking truth itself? (Or rather it’s not just whimsical).</li>
<li>Imaginative thinking is crucial for both artistic creation and scientific discovery
<ul>

<li></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Takeaway - their creative ideas took decades to form. Or went years without being published. - Surround yourself with people who challenge you - They created a new syllabus. - power is to those who hold it. Everyone else adapts.</p>
<p>Blog ideas: - don’t mistake challenge with truth. Someone who is on mistrurh side can convince you</p>

  <title>What’s your decision framework?</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/whats-your-decision-framework.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Annie Duke asks the question “how do you make decisions? What’s your framework?” (<a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a>)</p>
<p>She remarks that many people don’t have one. Many CEO’s just go off their gut.</p>
<p>I encountered this in my investing days (ahem, internship). I lead a discussion on a paper I had read about how emotions affect our judgment and investment decisions.</p>
<p>I proposed an idea: that the investors should make a spreadsheet with labels on their feelings for that decision. They can use this as further information later on when evaluating their buy/sell/holding decisions.</p>
<p>I was laughed out of the room.</p>
<p>“Hey! Why don’t we all get some mood rings?!” Well, that guy (the boss) was later fired, but that’s not the point.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-unhappy-investor-vector.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Don’t let your emotions cloud your judgment.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Point is: if you think you’re making decisions independent of your emotions, you’re incredibly mistaken. Judgment is based off reason and gut. Decisions usually rely on gut though. You have to “feel good”.</p>
<p>I had seen this boss make many decisions without explaining his thinking. “Hold.” Why? The company is tanking per reports. “Sell”, but this one’s looking good!</p>
<p>The point is nobody could replicate his decision making. Half the time it felt arbitrary.</p>
<p>Only later did I learn that one of the most famous investment company, Bridgewater Capital, does this very thing. It’s not for everybody, nor do I do it, but I think it’s a good idea 😄. # proposal</p>
<p>Make a spreadsheet for your decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What to decide</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Decision: what you chose</li>
<li>Rationale: why you chose it</li>
<li>Facts: supporting facts</li>
<li>Emotional Reasoning: how you “felt” about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do this for all decisions: even the “hold” decisions (maintain status quo). Because decision to not change course is a decision in and of itself.</p>

  <title>Organization and Minimalism</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/organization-and-minimalism.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It’s hard to be a minimalist as a parent. Or as…a human…in this economy. We all want more stuff.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-bear-with-messy-stuff.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">When in doubt, toss it out</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>With a small living space and a growing family I’ve grown accustomed to throwing stuff out. I grew up in a bigger house than I have now so there was space for everything. Now there’s space for very little. It’s actually a great feeling because I know what’s in every box (after doing some deep cleaning over winter break).</p>
<p>I remember helping a friend move in high school. Endless hoards of products, products, products. Three moving trucks. Why? I wondered.</p>
<p>My philosophy now is: RAM and Hard drive.</p>
<p>RAM: the random access memory. The things you see when you open doors affect your brain state. Your brain can only hold so much. If you live in clutter you have clutter. So the things you see in your house should reflect what you can hold in memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toys should have a theme (blocks, action figures, doll house). If it doesn’t match a theme, it’s gone (begone random slap bracelet! “Afuera!!!”, (quote from new Argentine President))</li>
<li>Things you see should be things you use. Don’t use flower every day? Don’t have it in the pantry. Put it in the corner thing. Cereal every day? Put that front and center.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then long-storage is the hard drive. It’s about keeping stuff you know you’ll want. This is easier to say than do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holiday decoration? (Theme) keep those in the attic, out of sight out of mind. But when you need it you know where it is.</li>
<li>You get the point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same goes for code. Maintenance and search cost increase as you add garbage. When it doubt, delete code. Afuera!!</p>
<p>When in doubt, “afuera!!”</p>

<ul>
<li>Give the book one hour. if it’s not great, then move on.
<ul>
<li>Aim to finish 30% of all books started? (Debating this.)</li>
<li>There are a million books and a million recommendations.</li>
<li>Not all books are worth the time though. Perhaps I’ve already learned that lesson. Perhaps it’s just not enjoyable, or I don’t like the author’s style. In these moments I wonder: what does this book being popular tell me about society? (There’s always something to be learned.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The good <em>stuff</em> sticks.
<ul>
<li>Note taking is interesting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fiction is more powerful for philosophy than anything
<ul>
<li>putting philosophy next to characters living it is better than just listening to <a href="../book-review/socrates-a-life-worth-living.html">“Socrates A Life Worth Living” by Devra Lehman</a> and hearing back and forth arguments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read things I’m not interested in
<ul>
<li>the best book on cooking. The best book on nascar, etc. I don’t need to be an expert in everything, but to pick a random field and get the best book in that field can open my mind up.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

  <title>Audiobooks</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I first discovered audiobooks it felt like a super power. I can listen while working out, while doing dishes, while folding laundry, etc. the possibilities! Then came Libby, the app that allows me to connect to my local library and do what?! Download audiobooks?! Yes plz.</p>
<p>In 2023 I got back into podcasts. Lots of All-in listening, a lot of Tim Ferris again, some Huberman, etc.</p>
<p>Despite fascinating interviews that tell the story of now, the benefit of a book is that it’s hundreds if not thousands of hours of mental preparation, editing, preparing. Why wouldn’t I want to read something that someone spent thousands of hours curating vs them just spitballing for 60m.</p>
<p>Some podcasts can tell a different story than you can get in a book, or tell the backstory, etc. but they’re usually on a podcast to get you to read the book!!</p>
<p>Thank you to the writers, and to all readers who give them an audience and a livelihood so they’ll keep writing.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 3 - Dreamed a Dream</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-3-dreamed-a-dream.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A great quote leading up to MLK Jr day:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Behold I have dreamed a dream <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-3.2">1 Nephi 3.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lehi dreamed many dreams. It got him in trouble with his boys, as Laman and Lemuel “did murmur in many things against their father, <strong>because he was a visionary man</strong>” (<a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.11">1 Nephi 2.11</a>).</p>
<p>Lehi’s wife, Sariah, also murmured against him, “she also had complained against my father, <strong>telling him that he was a visionary man;</strong> saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.” (<a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.2">1 Nephi 5.2</a>)</p>
<p>Lehi’s response to this is great:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I <strong>know that I am a visionary man</strong>; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren. But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.4-5">1 Nephi 5.4–5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This response teaches me a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>when people struggle, they can complain against a good thing and make it a bad thing. “Why do you always have to be such a goodie two shoes?”</li>
<li>The response is “if I weren’t such a goodie two shoes I’d be miserable”. Helps remind people of the value of their own biases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complaining is a natural part of life. Just be careful what you complain about.</p>

  <title>You can plan your life in 5 minutes</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It doesn’t take 30 years to plan a good life. It’s actually quite simple and if you sit down for 5 minutes you can figure out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do you like where you’re at? Heading? No? Where do you want to go? Why? What do you need to change to get there?</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>No fancy grand vision. No elaborate planning. Just maybe 15 minutes to plan ahead.</p>
<p>The speed of planning is 0.01% of the effort required to execute. “We’re going to the moon by the end of the decade”. Plan. Done. Execution is hard.</p>
<p>Ideas are fleeting. Plans are changeable. Plans and ideas aren’t the IP of your company. It’s the people and the execution. Thats the hard part.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for My Childhood</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/my-childhood.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I won the childhood lottery. I had good parents, good siblings, good friends, and luckily made a few good choices.</p>
<p>That’s all it takes: a few good choices. I credit my parents for giving me a good home to grow up in, a good religion to teach me good principles, and a lot of support.</p>
<p>As I grow older, time reveals itself. The dust under the childhood cushion is now identified. As I raise my own children I wonder: how did they do it?</p>
<p>Which perhaps is what my children will ask me someday.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Childhood is playing</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I’m grateful I played a lot.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for parents who take up the challenge to raise the next generation. I’m grateful for siblings to live, love, and learn from. For friends who make the journey an adventure, and for a family that I can always come back to.</p>

  <title>Junk attracts Junk</title>

<p>Ever throw the shoes <em>by</em> the shoe rack? Or leave <em>one</em> dish in the sink? You know what happens: an avalanche.</p>

<p>Badly formatted code attracts more badly formatted code.</p>
<p>But the same is for good: a clean floor makes you want to keep it clean.</p>
<p>So what explains the fulcrum - where is the balance between accepting dire straights vs pushing for perfection? We oscillate between these worlds as our attention wanders.</p>
<p>I’m guessing the fulcrum is based on incentives. Guests coming over? Clean up the house. Boss reviewing? Clean the code.</p>

  <title>Biden’s debt relief won’t relieve what he thinks it will</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/bidens-debt-relief-wont-relieve-what-he-thinks-it-will.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/the-quest-for-cosmic-justice.html">The Quest for Cosmic Justice</a>, Sowell points out repeatedly how policies focused on helping a target demographic may not only hinder them, but those around them too. Policies are for politicians to pursue power, to win the next vote.</p>
<p>What good does relieving <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-9-billion-student-debt-relief">130bn</a> in university debt do?</p>
<p>the argument is that our system is broken. So we’ll fix it with money.</p>
<p>The more flawed thinking is that “education is a right.” Should this be true, then food is a right. Then social media is a right. Our phones are a right.</p>
<p>Life is a right. Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, too.</p>
<p>But my decision to go 200k in debt for an investment that didn’t return dividends (hence my inability to pay), is not a right. It’s a poor investment choice.</p>
<p>Sending out money signals a poor precedence, apart from the blatant desire to buy votes. The economics aren’t aligned. The incentives are bad.</p>
<p>“Go learn about something, investing 4 years, and discover it’s not capable of helping you earn wages” is nothing more than a sabbatical.</p>
<p>We need to spend that money incentivizing innovation. Entrepreneurs. People who create value.</p>
<p>The “educated” masses (3.6m) who cannot afford to pay their debt, when they scoffed at tradespeople who were employable the moment they finished their 3 week training, and then asked those tradespeople to pay for their schooling, is disappointing.</p>
<p>We need to think about incentives, both long and short term.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">At some level the government stole from the uneducated to pay for the unemployable ‘educated’</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The solution: student loan officers should be on the hook to ask “what is your potential income return?” The loan must be payable within 8 years at a 10% additional tax on their wages. They need to be able to survive with this 10% tax, and the 10% tax over 8 years should be sufficient to pay the bills.</p>
<p>So if you have a $100k job, that’s $80k education. 10% tax for 8 years is 10k per year to pay the debt.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Strollers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/strollers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Plop them in, buckle them up. Go on a run, give them a cup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strollers are how I take my kids to school every day. I strap them in (or they just sit down), and I hop on my Onewheel and we go on a ride.</p>
<p>10 m.p.h., the wind in our hair, the cars waiting behind us because we’re fast enough and wide enough that they can’t pass us. All of this is good.</p>
<p>My kids get to see more of the world faster, even if that world is just here to school. My non-school kids can get out for a minute without a huge hassle on my part.</p>
<p>The best part is: the stroller rolls. I don’t have to drag it. I don’t have to slog it. It’s not a 50lb brick. It’s got wheels. The marvelous creation of the near frictionless geometric phenomena that is a wheel.</p>
<p>So I guess I’m also grateful for wheels and chariots. Thank you to whomever invented these things thousands of years ago.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/receiving-a-promised-land.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>While Lehi wandered in the wilderness, Nephi recounted he left the “land of his inheritance”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.4">1 Nephi 2.4</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-leaving-the-promised-land.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Leaving the promised land</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Yet by the end of the Chapter, Nephi is promised a land of inheritance:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-2.20">1 Nephi 2.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing how they lose one thing but gain another. Also amazing is how they had prophets warning them of Jerusalem’s destruction - why didn’t the Lord make <em>those</em> prophets leave?</p>
<p>He has a plan for us individually.</p>
<p>CS Lewis remarked something along the lines of “We don’t chase God, God chases us”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Both Malcolm Muggeridge and C.S. Lewis attest to this. Muggeridge wrote, “I had a notion that somehow, besides questing, I was being pursued.” Lewis said that, “…night after night…I sensed the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. Finally, I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed…” (<a href="https://www.stettlerindependent.com/community/man-can-not-sidestep-thinking-about-god-faith-and-reflection-6606319">link</a>, also discussed in <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a>) (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/681434-you-must-picture-me-alone-in-that-room-in-magdalen">good reads link</a>)</p>

<p>Poop on the ground? (<a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a>) It won’t last. it’s endearing.</p>
<p>No, this isn’t just fanciful thinking - this is a choice. You’ve chosen to be angry at that spilled milk, lost your cool when bro slapped sis, and walked out of the room when you heard that last cry for “more breakfast!!”.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> did you get overwhelmed? Stressed about all there is to do, and now there’s one more thing? Stressed about “am i a good parent”? Stressed about raising your kids right and you have to instruct them on everything they do wrong in order to do that?</p>
<p>My new philosophy: Kids are kids. They’re optimizers. Anyone in tech knows that an optimizer is a thing trying to find the optimal point of another thing. It’s like battleships - you keep guessing until you find. Then you guess around until you get all the points, until you know where to look.</p>
<p>Kids do this all day. They say something crazy trying to get a reaction. They say a not-funny joke 100 times until it’s funny again. Humans do that too.</p>
<p>So they’re optimizing. Exploring. Exploiting. That’s all their doing - exploring the space, exploiting the emotional signal.</p>
<p>Knowing that, find the fun in the moment. They won’t always be like this. And when it’s gone, you’ll wish it wasn’t. <a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a></p>

<li>cosmic justice - principle of equity</li>
<li>People who want equality will end up destroying it - Milton Friedman’s. They’ll be consumed by their power.</li>
<li>We must consider the costs given the world we live in now. We cannot recreate the world from scratch.</li>

  <title>Cool Quarto Site</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/cool-quarto-site.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Quarto lists a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/">gallery</a> of things you can do with it.</p>
<p>This post illustrates</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How you can array your blog</li>
<li>How you can collect subscribers with just google form</li>
<li>How you can iframe other apps, such as from huggingface.</li>
</ol>
<p>I came across this site: <a href="https://forbo7.github.io/" class="uri">https://forbo7.github.io/</a>. I enjoyed seeing how they arrayed their blogs, which I had never seen before - they used grids.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/quarto-demo-forbo7-landing.png" class="preview-image img-fluid"></p>
<p>They use an embedded google form for subscriptions:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/screenshot-quarto-demo-forbo7-subscribe.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And they have an<a href="https://forbo7.github.io/web_apps/apps/flood_detector.html">iframe on a Huggingface</a> app to show something cool:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/quarto-demo-forbo7-huggingface.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That’s all.</p>

  <title>He prepares us to teach us</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/he-prepares-us-to-teach-us.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Consider this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen. And being <strong>thus</strong> overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.7-8">1 Nephi 1.7–8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cause and effect. First: he was overcome by the spirit. Second, he had a vision.</p>
<p>But that’s not how the vision came. First, it began with prayer.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.5-6">1 Nephi 1.5–6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here’s the order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lehi listens to prophets that Jerusalem will be destroyed (4)</li>
<li>Lehi prays for his people, hoping they won’t be (5)</li>
<li>Lehi sees a pillar of fire, sees many things (6)</li>
<li>Lehi returns home (assumes he’s not home), and is overcome with what he saw (7)</li>
<li>Lehi then has another, more pronounced vision (8)</li>
</ol>
<p>What a way to start off the Book of Mormon: this is a book about personal revelation, written by people who had revelations, and it teaches us the pattern. In this case, we care about others. When we do, the heavens open as we pray.</p>
<p>We prob won’t have visions, but we <em>will</em> have the spirit.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for <strong>unto him that receiveth I will give more</strong> <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-28.30">2 Nephi 28.30</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m grateful for people who really know how to sing. This song moved me, and I’m grateful music has that capacity.</p>

  <title>I’m grateful for small things</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/small-things.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In my deli this morning (<a href="../gratitude/sandwich-shops.html">I’m Grateful for Sandwich Shops</a>), there’s a cheesy quote on the pinboard:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Maturity is not when we start speaking big things. It is when we start appreciating the small things…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I’ve started to give thanks daily. It’s a powerful rewiring of the brain.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls. <a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7">Alma 37.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effects so far of giving thanks daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think about what I gave thanks on later in the day</li>
<li>While writing, ideas flood into the mind, building the thoughts more than initially realized</li>
<li>it hones my mind to prepare ahead and think about something. What I write about I think about: before and after.</li>
<li>It’s fun to blog about things as they happen, such as <a href="../gratitude/sandwich-shops.html">I’m Grateful for Sandwich Shops</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned once on <a href="../concepts/my-mission.html">my mission</a> that “when I don’t have gratitude, I don’t have anything.” I remember the day I learned this, discussing the concept with my roommate/companion. Those who don’t give thanks end up complaining. If you’re complaining then you don’t have anything you want. If you give thanks, you have everything you could want. The list is endless on both ends.</p>
<p><a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.</p>

<p>I grew up in a suburban town in Connecticut. Italians and their amazing propensity for delicious food and sandwiches seemed to flood the streets.</p>
<p>A brilliant chicken salad melt that truly melts in your mouth.</p>
<p>A chicken parm from D corner deli that would energize you from lunch through dinner - a classic among rabid pubescent football players.</p>
<p>Adding “con papas” to any “BEC” meant you were in for a filling treat. It was the insider’s secret menu item, and the man behind the counter knew you had good taste.</p>

  <title>The six hour sandwich</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/the-six-hour-sandwich.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“Avocado and turkey over ciabatta, it’s a delicious way to start your day and fills you up for about six hours.”</p>
<p>That last part - six hours…I had never heard such a sales pitch from a deli person in my life.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-avocado-sandwich.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Six hour sandwich</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>But it’s the perfect sales pitch. Because I care how full I’m going to get off a $13.00 breakfast sandwich. But he just amortized the cost for me - implicitly stating it’s only $2.16/hr for 6 hours.</p>
<p>Would I pay $2 to not be hungry for an hour? I’m not sure what other snack (maybe a .60c banana) can fill me up for an hour.</p>
<p>Genius.</p>

  <title>Praying for Other People</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/praying-for-other-people.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This scripture stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-1.5">1 Nephi 1.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many verses like this, such as Enos praying for his people, or Christ saying “Oh Jerusalem”, or Enoch.</p>
<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> right now and considered just how influenced these authors were by their surroundings. WWI, the rise of machines, etc.</p>
<p>Aren’t we all influenced by the people around us? What role do those people play in our lives? What role do the loved ones play in our lives? What role do we play in theirs?</p>

<p>Sometimes they tell you that at the pharmacy: “this drug is habit forming”. Or, the saline nasal spray bottle thing I tried once, “this spray is refreshing, but not habit forming.” Oh, how nice.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t everything have this distinction? Driving in the car: non habit forming. Eating a bag of goldfish when I’m noodling on a work problem: def habit forming.</p>
<p>One time, someone put a candy jar with skittles right beside my desk. It was for the whole floor, but my consumption was certainly not a pro-rata share. Buggy code? Gimme some skittles. Habit formed.</p>
<p>Social media? Someone likes your post? Habit formed.</p>

<p>Why don’t they warn that social media is one of the most addictive digital things we do? That we’ve just accepted as a society?</p>
<p>It took until 1964 before the surgeon general announced smoking caused cancer. The first cigarette machine was invented in 1881 by Albert Bonsack. That’s +80 years, not to mention it was popular for much longer before that.</p>
<p>So yes, society can get it wrong for many years before they change course and do the more healthful thing.</p>

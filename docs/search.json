If you see a big reaction, you know you found a number they cared about.\nGo ahead, write the conclusion first. Fake the chart first.

    "text": "Since that time, I’ve thought about how valuable it was to get information straight from the source.\nAlberto Savoia’s new book, “The Right It”, is re-teaching me this principle. Data beats opinions, he says. In another book I’m reading, “Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments”, the former CEO of Netscape is quoted saying,\n\nIf we have data, let’s go with data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine. - Jim Barksdale\n\nData sourced from your manager, your stakeholder, or your customer are invaluable to help you know if you’re solving their problem. Too often it’s easy to get stuck in the original solution that comes to our mind.\nData from customers directly shape the product. Data sourced at scale from online experiments refine it.\nOpinions from the customer shape the product. Their behavior (captured as data) speaks louder than their words. Frequently, it’s challenging to correlate the two. We’re left to guess why someone actually clicked, bought, churned. It’s a beautiful cycle.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{whiting2020,\n  author = {Bryan Whiting},\n  title = {Data {Beats} {Opinions}},\n  date = {2020-12-15},\n  url = {https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/2020-12-15-data-beats-opinions},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBryan Whiting. 2020. “Data Beats Opinions.” December 15,\n2020. https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/2020-12-15-data-beats-opinions."

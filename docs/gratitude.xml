  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Navajo Code Talkers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/navajo-code-talkers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>My daughter brought home a book that introduced something I had never before heard about: Navajo code talkers.</p>
<p>Since the Navajo language had never been written down, it wasn‚Äôt able to be translated by the Japanese in WWII. And so, the Navajo would encode English words and transmit their words across the radio to talk about positions and bombs and such. It helped them win the war.</p>
<p>They chose to serve a country they were being heavily persecuted in (<a href="../book-review/killers-of-the-flower-moon.html">Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI</a>). It‚Äôs incredible to think about.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm grateful for them and all like them that helped provide the freedoms I enjoy.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Early Morning Workouts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/early-morning-workouts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I played football when in middle and high school. Part of the high school routine was early morning summer workouts.</p>
<p>6:30 am is brutal for a 16 year old kid. But getting up, going to the school to run some sprints, get a lift in, and get home by 8 to shower and go back to sleep was always a great feeling.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm grateful that to this day I still value exercise. I know the benefits it gives me. I also know how to lift properly so I don‚Äôt hurt myself. I also have muscle/ligament memory where it‚Äôs easier to pick up after 6months of not exercising compared to someone starting from scratch. (Maybe that‚Äôs not a scientific thing, but I feel like it is üòÇ).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm slightly less grateful that my 16 year old self could bench more than I‚Äôll ever again be able to bench, and run more than I‚Äôll ever again have time to run, but perhaps I‚Äôm grateful I can challenge myself to surpass my teenage years.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Similarities</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/similarities.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything truly unique about any one individual? At the very least, any two people probably have eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose. They probably have brain and a heart. Probably have fingers and toes.</p>
<p>Probably have feelings. Experience love. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Resentment. Joy. Elation. Fear. Anxiety. Doubt. Faith. Fulfillment. Hope.</p>
<p>The reason why they feel these things will certainly be unique to them, but likely follow the themes of family, friends, food, shelter, fulfillment, etc.</p>
<p>I learned after being in Honduras for 6 weeks just how different I was from people across the world.</p>
<p>6 months later I learned (over time) just how deeply similar they are.</p>
<p>After 2 years I came home and deeply missed Honduras. I felt alone and lost in this American world.</p>
<p>Now I‚Äôm somewhere in between. But the point is: I‚Äôm grateful that humans can connect at a deeply human level no matter who they are or where they‚Äôre from.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Social Gatherings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/social-gatherings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week I went to a tiny venue concert. The person who invited me said, ‚ÄúCan you believe that just two years ago we were forbidden to gather like this?‚Äù</p>
<p>We were listening to a Honky Tonk/Rockability Banjo jammer who just absolutely slayed the whole night. The energy was off the charts. Everyone was dancing and having a great time.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm glad and grateful we can get together again.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Baby Formula</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/baby-formula.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Baby formula is a miracle. According to the internet, without it, people would either use cows milk, goats milk, etc and mix it with water and honey.</p>
<p>The fact that people can go to the store and buy food to feed their infant is a miracle. It‚Äôs one of the things that has reduced infant mortality.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Things I Don‚Äôt Understand</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/things-i-dont-understand.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I don‚Äôt know about or understand a lot of things. Here‚Äôs a random list:</p>
<ul>
<li>molecular biology</li>
<li>brain surgery</li>
<li>Shakespeare</li>
<li>Diplomacy between nations</li>
<li>Best teaching methods for four year olds</li>
<li>How the heater in my house works</li>
<li>How Apple Silicon works</li>
<li>A lot of data science stuff despite working as a data scientist for 10 years</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing with knowledge is that the more you get of it, the more questions you have about the world. It was kind of hard even making that list above because I know enough to know that I don‚Äôt know enough about it. What about all the things I know nothing about. Or scarier, what about the things I think I know something about but really don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>All these things mean there‚Äôs something to be learned on every day, every minute. The world is full. We are all multi-faceted individuals who can do a ton of different things. Perhaps often we compare ourselves to those who know most about a subject vs the value and opportunity we bring with the unique set of knowledge each of us has accumulated.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôm usually wrong. It means there‚Äôs a better way. And if things turned out okay <em>and</em> I‚Äôm wrong, that‚Äôs even better: it means I can improve!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôm able to learn from anyone on earth, who at least has a guaranteed different life experience and set of knowledge gained. I‚Äôm also grateful that everyone else is as imperfect as me, which means I can challenge them to figure out how they came to their knowledge and whether their knowledge is actually that or just a belief/opinion/etc.</p>
<p>All of this is fun, gives diversity to life, lets me know that there‚Äôs hope for a better world.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Music</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/music.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Music is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not much of a musician, but I do love it. The first time I learned to play the guitar I felt a new form of communication.</p>
<p>I had known the piano before that, having played it in high school. But there was something about the guitar that taught me how to speak with music.</p>
<p>You speak with random noises from your mouth, surely you can speak with emotion from a musical instrument.</p>
<p>And people do. Great musicians communicate something in a way that words alone cannot express. And sometimes the music itself evokes an identity you didn‚Äôt know existed.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the power of music. And I think it‚Äôs really cool that humans all over the world understand this power.</p>

<p>Reminds me as well of a close friend who wrote an album when a loved one passed away. Those were some of the most beautiful lyrics and music I had ever heard. Sometimes the best music comes from nobodies, including yourself.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Open Source</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/open-source.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Open source software is incredible. I‚Äôm deeply grateful for the people who create it and share it.</p>
<p>So much of the world benefits from open source software. YouTube was built off Python. Samsung phones run on Android. Most modern websites are built off something Zuckerberg released. PyTorch and Tensorflow have ushered in the AI revolution.</p>
<p>We‚Äôd get along without open source. But we‚Äôd be using SAS or Stata, beholden to Oracle and Java everywhere and just enduring a slow pace of innovation.</p>
<p>AI is open sourced. The future is now.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Ice Skating</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ice-skating.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I went ice skating. It was great.</p>
<p>I remembered a video about this old guy that wakes up at 5am or something and goes out and waters the ice rink. He fills up a few tubs of his own hot water and just treks over to the public park to fill up the rink. He uses his own homemade zamboni and what not.</p>
<p>There are good people in this world.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Ice rink</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What‚Äôs cool about an ice rink is I don‚Äôt think about it for 364 days a year. But it‚Äôs there when I want to go. So that means enough people love it to keep it in business, and I can go only when I want to (once a year). Thats a cool thing too: collective community makes so many things possible, like downtown restaurants and museums - places that if they relied just on me they‚Äôd never last. But the community keeps them afloat (pun?).</p>
<p>I tried finding it, but this is the closest thing I could find. Just imagine this very old guy out there shlepping 55 gallon drums of water.</p>

<p>I found it!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs just become a way of life. If I don‚Äôt do the rink I don‚Äôt feel right.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Heaven</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/heaven.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I‚Äôm not sure what I would do if I didn‚Äôt have a concept of Heaven in my mind. It yields so very many benefits for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives me hope for when family members pass</li>
<li>Reminds me why life matters: I can only take with me my relationships.</li>
<li>Heaven is about people, not money. Reminds me what matters <em>in</em> life and what will bring me happiness.</li>
<li>Gives me purpose as I raise my family.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a sense that heaven is more like a peaceful home than a luxurious resort. Physical amenities don‚Äôt yield joy. True pleasure and enduring happiness in life come from inner peace.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">My heavenly home would probably be more spruced up, but this is pretty peaceful.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As a concept alone, it guides you to make better decisions by living long term: death is only a door to the beyond. Even if I assume that heaven is a farce, still believing in it yields so much good for one‚Äôs life. But thankfully it‚Äôs not just some notion. It‚Äôs a real place. I‚Äôm grateful the Lord created the heavens.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-4.9">Mosiah 4.9</a></p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for My Childhood</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/my-childhood.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I won the childhood lottery. I had good parents, good siblings, good friends, and luckily made a few good choices.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs all it takes: a few good choices. I credit my parents for giving me a good home to grow up in, a good religion to teach me good principles, and a lot of support.</p>
<p>As I grow older, time reveals itself. The dust under the childhood cushion is now identified. As I raise my own children I wonder: how did they do it?</p>
<p>Which perhaps is what my children will ask me someday.</p>

</div>
<p>I‚Äôm grateful I played a lot.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm grateful for parents who take up the challenge to raise the next generation. I‚Äôm grateful for siblings to live, love, and learn from. For friends who make the journey an adventure, and for a family that I can always come back to.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Strollers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/strollers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Plop them in, buckle them up. Go on a run, give them a cup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strollers are how I take my kids to school every day. I strap them in (or they just sit down), and I hop on my Onewheel and we go on a ride.</p>
<p>10 m.p.h., the wind in our hair, the cars waiting behind us because we‚Äôre fast enough and wide enough that they can‚Äôt pass us. All of this is good.</p>
<p>My kids get to see more of the world faster, even if that world is just here to school. My non-school kids can get out for a minute without a huge hassle on my part.</p>
<p>The best part is: the stroller rolls. I don‚Äôt have to drag it. I don‚Äôt have to slog it. It‚Äôs not a 50lb brick. It‚Äôs got wheels. The marvelous creation of the near frictionless geometric phenomena that is a wheel.</p>
<p>So I guess I‚Äôm also grateful for wheels and chariots. Thank you to whomever invented these things thousands of years ago.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm grateful for small things</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/small-things.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In my deli this morning (<a href="../gratitude/sandwich-shops.html">I‚Äôm Grateful for Sandwich Shops</a>), there‚Äôs a cheesy quote on the pinboard:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Maturity is not when we start speaking big things. It is when we start appreciating the small things‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I‚Äôve started to give thanks daily. It‚Äôs a powerful rewiring of the brain.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls. <a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7">Alma 37.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effects so far of giving thanks daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think about what I gave thanks on later in the day</li>
<li>While writing, ideas flood into the mind, building the thoughts more than initially realized</li>
<li>it hones my mind to prepare ahead and think about something. What I write about I think about: before and after.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs fun to blog about things as they happen, such as <a href="../gratitude/sandwich-shops.html">I‚Äôm Grateful for Sandwich Shops</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned once on <a href="../concepts/my-mission.html">my mission</a> that ‚Äúwhen I don‚Äôt have gratitude, I don‚Äôt have anything.‚Äù I remember the day I learned this, discussing the concept with my roommate/companion. Those who don‚Äôt give thanks end up complaining. If you‚Äôre complaining then you don‚Äôt have anything you want. If you give thanks, you have everything you could want. The list is endless on both ends.</p>
<p><a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I grew up in a suburban town in Connecticut. Italians and their amazing propensity for delicious food and sandwiches seemed to flood the streets.</p>
<p>A brilliant chicken salad melt that truly melts in your mouth.</p>
<p>A chicken parm from D corner deli that would energize you from lunch through dinner - a classic among rabid pubescent football players.</p>
<p>Adding ‚Äúcon papas‚Äù to any ‚ÄúBEC‚Äù meant you were in for a filling treat. It was the insider‚Äôs secret menu item, and the man behind the counter knew you had good taste.</p>

  <title>Audiobooks</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/audiobooks.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I first discovered audiobooks it felt like a super power. I can listen while working out, while doing dishes, while folding laundry, etc. the possibilities! Then came Libby, the app that allows me to connect to my local library and do what?! Download audiobooks?! Yes plz.</p>
<p>In 2023 I got back into podcasts. Lots of All-in listening, a lot of Tim Ferris again, some Huberman, etc.</p>
<p>Despite fascinating interviews that tell the story of now, the benefit of a book is that it‚Äôs hundreds if not thousands of hours of mental preparation, editing, preparing. Why wouldn‚Äôt I want to read something that someone spent thousands of hours curating vs them just spitballing for 60m.</p>
<p>Some podcasts can tell a different story than you can get in a book, or tell the backstory, etc. but they‚Äôre usually on a podcast to get you to read the book!!</p>
<p>Thank you to the writers, and to all readers who give them an audience and a livelihood so they‚Äôll keep writing.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for the Toothbrush</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/toothbrush.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything more refreshing than brushing your teeth? Anything less satisfying than going to bed without brushing your teeth (camping, airplane ride?)?</p>
<p>Brushing my teeth is a gift. And I know it prevents problems (cavities, disease, etc). It also enables me to have more sugar, which is probably bad for me but I enjoy regardless.</p>
<p>In <a href="../book-review/the-power-of-habit.html">The Power of Habit</a> and learned about this great fact about tooth brushing (summarized by ChatGPT):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yes, ‚ÄúThe Power of Habit‚Äù by Charles Duhigg does mention toothpaste. The book discusses how toothpaste companies, particularly Pepsodent, leveraged the power of habit to increase their product‚Äôs usage. Duhigg explains how Pepsodent created a daily habit for people by associating the use of toothpaste with the tingling sensation it produces, which wasn‚Äôt common in toothpastes before Pepsodent. This case study is used to illustrate how cues and rewards can create lasting habits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pepsodent and their marketing team in the 1920‚Äôs changed life for us all. Same goes for body wash, hand soap, and other soaps - they put the bubbles in them to make us think it‚Äôs ‚Äúworking‚Äù.</p>
<p>But I also like bubbles. Who doesn‚Äôt like bubbles? Toothpaste has bubbles. What a gift.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When‚Äôs the last time I walked 40 miles? 30? 20? 10?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been a minute. Only 150 years ago or 200 years ago I may have done one of those maybe once a month or year.</p>
<p>While I‚Äôm not entirely sure it‚Äôs beneficial for my health <em>not</em> to walk a ton every day, I‚Äôm grateful for cars.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can live far from my workplace.</li>
<li>I can visit my parents in a day, today if I wanted</li>
<li>I can go to the hills, take a hike, and be back to take my kids to school</li>
<li>I can go get groceries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe life was simpler back in the days without cars, I‚Äôm not sure. But I‚Äôm grateful for the variety of life I can live <em>with</em> a car. I also remember not having easy access to a car while living in the city and I just felt so trapped all the time. Cars are great.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Haircuts</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Growing up my mom would cut my hair. I would sit in the bathroom on a wooden stool, looking into the mirror.</p>
<p>Today I cut my son‚Äôs hair for the first time. I couldn‚Äôt help but think of those many years of one-on-one conversations with my mom.</p>
<p>Spending time just sitting and talking can be the best time we have to share. It can be something as simple as a boring haircut.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Social Gatherings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/social-gatherings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week I went to a tiny venue concert. The person who invited me said, “Can you believe that just two years ago we were forbidden to gather like this?”</p>
<p>We were listening to a Honky Tonk/Rockability Banjo jammer who just absolutely slayed the whole night. The energy was off the charts. Everyone was dancing and having a great time.</p>
<p>I’m glad and grateful we can get together again.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Baby Formula</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/baby-formula.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Baby formula is a miracle. According to the internet, without it, people would either use cows milk, goats milk, etc and mix it with water and honey.</p>
<p>The fact that people can go to the store and buy food to feed their infant is a miracle. It’s one of the things that has reduced infant mortality.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Things I Don’t Understand</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/things-i-dont-understand.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I don’t know about or understand a lot of things. Here’s a random list:</p>
<ul>
<li>molecular biology</li>
<li>brain surgery</li>
<li>Shakespeare</li>
<li>Diplomacy between nations</li>
<li>Best teaching methods for four year olds</li>
<li>How the heater in my house works</li>
<li>How Apple Silicon works</li>
<li>A lot of data science stuff despite working as a data scientist for 10 years</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing with knowledge is that the more you get of it, the more questions you have about the world. It was kind of hard even making that list above because I know enough to know that I don’t know enough about it. What about all the things I know nothing about. Or scarier, what about the things I think I know something about but really don’t.</p>
<p>All these things mean there’s something to be learned on every day, every minute. The world is full. We are all multi-faceted individuals who can do a ton of different things. Perhaps often we compare ourselves to those who know most about a subject vs the value and opportunity we bring with the unique set of knowledge each of us has accumulated.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’m usually wrong. It means there’s a better way. And if things turned out okay <em>and</em> I’m wrong, that’s even better: it means I can improve!</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’m able to learn from anyone on earth, who at least has a guaranteed different life experience and set of knowledge gained. I’m also grateful that everyone else is as imperfect as me, which means I can challenge them to figure out how they came to their knowledge and whether their knowledge is actually that or just a belief/opinion/etc.</p>
<p>All of this is fun, gives diversity to life, lets me know that there’s hope for a better world.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Music</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/music.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Music is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I’m not much of a musician, but I do love it. The first time I learned to play the guitar I felt a new form of communication.</p>
<p>I had known the piano before that, having played it in high school. But there was something about the guitar that taught me how to speak with music.</p>
<p>You speak with random noises from your mouth, surely you can speak with emotion from a musical instrument.</p>
<p>And people do. Great musicians communicate something in a way that words alone cannot express. And sometimes the music itself evokes an identity you didn’t know existed.</p>
<p>That’s the power of music. And I think it’s really cool that humans all over the world understand this power.</p>

<p>Reminds me as well of a close friend who wrote an album when a loved one passed away. Those were some of the most beautiful lyrics and music I had ever heard. Sometimes the best music comes from nobodies, including yourself.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Open Source</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/open-source.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Open source software is incredible. I’m deeply grateful for the people who create it and share it.</p>
<p>So much of the world benefits from open source software. YouTube was built off Python. Samsung phones run on Android. Most modern websites are built off something Zuckerberg released. PyTorch and Tensorflow have ushered in the AI revolution.</p>
<p>We’d get along without open source. But we’d be using SAS or Stata, beholden to Oracle and Java everywhere and just enduring a slow pace of innovation.</p>
<p>AI is open sourced. The future is now.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Ice Skating</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ice-skating.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I went ice skating. It was great.</p>
<p>I remembered a video about this old guy that wakes up at 5am or something and goes out and waters the ice rink. He fills up a few tubs of his own hot water and just treks over to the public park to fill up the rink. He uses his own homemade zamboni and what not.</p>
<p>There are good people in this world.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Ice rink</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What’s cool about an ice rink is I don’t think about it for 364 days a year. But it’s there when I want to go. So that means enough people love it to keep it in business, and I can go only when I want to (once a year). Thats a cool thing too: collective community makes so many things possible, like downtown restaurants and museums - places that if they relied just on me they’d never last. But the community keeps them afloat (pun?).</p>
<p>I tried finding it, but this is the closest thing I could find. Just imagine this very old guy out there shlepping 55 gallon drums of water.</p>

<p>I found it!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s just become a way of life. If I don’t do the rink I don’t feel right.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Heaven</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/heaven.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m not sure what I would do if I didn’t have a concept of Heaven in my mind. It yields so very many benefits for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives me hope for when family members pass</li>
<li>Reminds me why life matters: I can only take with me my relationships.</li>
<li>Heaven is about people, not money. Reminds me what matters <em>in</em> life and what will bring me happiness.</li>
<li>Gives me purpose as I raise my family.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a sense that heaven is more like a peaceful home than a luxurious resort. Physical amenities don’t yield joy. True pleasure and enduring happiness in life come from inner peace.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-heavenly-home.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">My heavenly home would probably be more spruced up, but this is pretty peaceful.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As a concept alone, it guides you to make better decisions by living long term: death is only a door to the beyond. Even if I assume that heaven is a farce, still believing in it yields so much good for one’s life. But thankfully it’s not just some notion. It’s a real place. I’m grateful the Lord created the heavens.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-4.9">Mosiah 4.9</a></p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for My Childhood</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/my-childhood.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I won the childhood lottery. I had good parents, good siblings, good friends, and luckily made a few good choices.</p>
<p>That’s all it takes: a few good choices. I credit my parents for giving me a good home to grow up in, a good religion to teach me good principles, and a lot of support.</p>
<p>As I grow older, time reveals itself. The dust under the childhood cushion is now identified. As I raise my own children I wonder: how did they do it?</p>
<p>Which perhaps is what my children will ask me someday.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Childhood is playing</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I’m grateful I played a lot.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for parents who take up the challenge to raise the next generation. I’m grateful for siblings to live, love, and learn from. For friends who make the journey an adventure, and for a family that I can always come back to.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Strollers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/strollers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Plop them in, buckle them up. Go on a run, give them a cup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strollers are how I take my kids to school every day. I strap them in (or they just sit down), and I hop on my Onewheel and we go on a ride.</p>
<p>10 m.p.h., the wind in our hair, the cars waiting behind us because we’re fast enough and wide enough that they can’t pass us. All of this is good.</p>
<p>My kids get to see more of the world faster, even if that world is just here to school. My non-school kids can get out for a minute without a huge hassle on my part.</p>
<p>The best part is: the stroller rolls. I don’t have to drag it. I don’t have to slog it. It’s not a 50lb brick. It’s got wheels. The marvelous creation of the near frictionless geometric phenomena that is a wheel.</p>
<p>So I guess I’m also grateful for wheels and chariots. Thank you to whomever invented these things thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>I’m grateful for people who really know how to sing. This song moved me, and I’m grateful music has that capacity.</p>

  <title>I’m grateful for small things</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/small-things.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In my deli this morning (<a href="../gratitude/sandwich-shops.html">I’m Grateful for Sandwich Shops</a>), there’s a cheesy quote on the pinboard:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Maturity is not when we start speaking big things. It is when we start appreciating the small things…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I’ve started to give thanks daily. It’s a powerful rewiring of the brain.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls. <a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7">Alma 37.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effects so far of giving thanks daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think about what I gave thanks on later in the day</li>
<li>While writing, ideas flood into the mind, building the thoughts more than initially realized</li>
<li>it hones my mind to prepare ahead and think about something. What I write about I think about: before and after.</li>
<li>It’s fun to blog about things as they happen, such as <a href="../gratitude/sandwich-shops.html">I’m Grateful for Sandwich Shops</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned once on <a href="../concepts/my-mission.html">my mission</a> that “when I don’t have gratitude, I don’t have anything.” I remember the day I learned this, discussing the concept with my roommate/companion. Those who don’t give thanks end up complaining. If you’re complaining then you don’t have anything you want. If you give thanks, you have everything you could want. The list is endless on both ends.</p>
<p><a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.</p>

<p>I grew up in a suburban town in Connecticut. Italians and their amazing propensity for delicious food and sandwiches seemed to flood the streets.</p>
<p>A brilliant chicken salad melt that truly melts in your mouth.</p>
<p>A chicken parm from D corner deli that would energize you from lunch through dinner - a classic among rabid pubescent football players.</p>
<p>Adding “con papas” to any “BEC” meant you were in for a filling treat. It was the insider’s secret menu item, and the man behind the counter knew you had good taste.</p>

  <title>Audiobooks</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/audiobooks.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I first discovered audiobooks it felt like a super power. I can listen while working out, while doing dishes, while folding laundry, etc. the possibilities! Then came Libby, the app that allows me to connect to my local library and do what?! Download audiobooks?! Yes plz.</p>
<p>In 2023 I got back into podcasts. Lots of All-in listening, a lot of Tim Ferris again, some Huberman, etc.</p>
<p>Despite fascinating interviews that tell the story of now, the benefit of a book is that it’s hundreds if not thousands of hours of mental preparation, editing, preparing. Why wouldn’t I want to read something that someone spent thousands of hours curating vs them just spitballing for 60m.</p>
<p>Some podcasts can tell a different story than you can get in a book, or tell the backstory, etc. but they’re usually on a podcast to get you to read the book!!</p>
<p>Thank you to the writers, and to all readers who give them an audience and a livelihood so they’ll keep writing.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the Toothbrush</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/toothbrush.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything more refreshing than brushing your teeth? Anything less satisfying than going to bed without brushing your teeth (camping, airplane ride?)?</p>
<p>Brushing my teeth is a gift. And I know it prevents problems (cavities, disease, etc). It also enables me to have more sugar, which is probably bad for me but I enjoy regardless.</p>
<p>In <a href="../book-review/the-power-of-habit.html">The Power of Habit</a> and learned about this great fact about tooth brushing (summarized by ChatGPT):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yes, “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg does mention toothpaste. The book discusses how toothpaste companies, particularly Pepsodent, leveraged the power of habit to increase their product’s usage. Duhigg explains how Pepsodent created a daily habit for people by associating the use of toothpaste with the tingling sensation it produces, which wasn’t common in toothpastes before Pepsodent. This case study is used to illustrate how cues and rewards can create lasting habits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pepsodent and their marketing team in the 1920’s changed life for us all. Same goes for body wash, hand soap, and other soaps - they put the bubbles in them to make us think it’s “working”.</p>
<p>But I also like bubbles. Who doesn’t like bubbles? Toothpaste has bubbles. What a gift.</p>

  <title>Cars</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When’s the last time I walked 40 miles? 30? 20? 10?</p>
<p>It’s been a minute. Only 150 years ago or 200 years ago I may have done one of those maybe once a month or year.</p>
<p>While I’m not entirely sure it’s beneficial for my health <em>not</em> to walk a ton every day, I’m grateful for cars.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can live far from my workplace.</li>
<li>I can visit my parents in a day, today if I wanted</li>
<li>I can go to the hills, take a hike, and be back to take my kids to school</li>
<li>I can go get groceries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe life was simpler back in the days without cars, I’m not sure. But I’m grateful for the variety of life I can live <em>with</em> a car. I also remember not having easy access to a car while living in the city and I just felt so trapped all the time. Cars are great.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Haircuts</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Growing up my mom would cut my hair. I would sit in the bathroom on a wooden stool, looking into the mirror.</p>
<p>Today I cut my son’s hair for the first time. I couldn’t help but think of those many years of one-on-one conversations with my mom.</p>
<p>Spending time just sitting and talking can be the best time we have to share. It can be something as simple as a boring haircut.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for time.</p>
<p>Time to live. Time to breathe. Time to eat. Time to walk. Time to sit at my computer and hope I’m making a difference in the world. Time to be with my family and realize I am.</p>
<p>Children are more affected by time than others. Time robs them of their youth, forcing them minute by minute into the world. But time is generous, equitable, and just. It’s fair to everyone. We all have time.</p>
<p>But we don’t all have the same time. Someone I know had cancer. Their time was marked. Another with cancer had their marking erased. Another on a bike passed out mid ride; time ran out. Another on a hill whose time was almost out recovered quickly. Time.</p>
<p>And I’m grateful for that time is temporary. (<a href="../creative/poem-the-dove-forevermore.html">The Dove (Forevermore)</a>)</p>

  <title>Hard Work and its Reward</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/hard-work.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>My dad grew up on a sheep farm. And his dad grew up farming too. Same with his dad, all the way back to when dads were a thing.</p>
<p>One of my grand/great grands worked on a beet farm. I read a story once about the beet farmers by Jay Jensen. It was called “Hoe to the end of the row” (apparently there’s a poem with that same title).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-beat-farming.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Beet it, just beet it…</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The principle the author shared was of planting to the end of the row. Some people got lazy and gave up 80% of the way through. But the hard workers went to the end. They took pride in it. And when the harvest came the boss knew who was coming back next summer: those with finished rows.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for hard work. My grandpa told my dad to work with his mind, not his back.<br>
So my dad got a desk job. And so did I.</p>
<p>Perhaps if my grandpa had seen today maybe he would instead say “get off those screens and go plant a beet”. But hard work is hard regardless of it being mental or physical. “Hard work” is the reward itself.</p>
<p>In another quote my father shared with me: “the gift of a good life is having lived it”. Same applies to hard work. The reward of hard work is having done it.</p>
<p>Most of what we do on a daily basis goes unnoticed. The rewards are for ourselves. This is a joy of life.</p>

  <title>Zoom</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/zoom.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I first heard about zoom many years ago on a random podcast. Had no idea what it was or why it was useful. Now it’s enabled me to work remotely, chat with friends across the nation, and even attend church during lockdowns.</p>
<p>Behind this is a person with an idea that changed the world. Surely they weren’t the first video service, but they build off the earlier, crappier products.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for V1’s like Skype that paved the way for Zoom, which learned a ton, probably poached some talent, and gave me something with using.</p>

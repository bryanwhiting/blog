  <title>The Thief of Time</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There are only two robbers of childhood: death and time.</p>
<p>Time is a death in a way. A cessation of your four year old self. Of your 10 year old self. Of your ignorant self. Of your yesterday self.</p>
<p>Time is constant, pushing us closer to one inevitable.</p>
<p>Time is a gift, the only gift we all share while here on earth.</p>
<p>What is the time constant? There’s a gravitational constant. A Planck constant. What about a time constant - the rate at which time ticks? At which our molecules age. At which our beings move from one state to another?</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll get the time to answer that…</p>

<p>How would you like to sleep next to a stranger?</p>
<p>How about <em>between</em> two strangers?</p>
<p>And sometimes you cuddle! But you can’t pick the strangers.</p>
<p>Oh! And all three of you are sleeping in chairs!</p>
<p>Does that sound like something you’d like? No!?</p>
<p>But what if you got a midnight snack, would that make it better?</p>
<p>Or if someone interrupted your sleep at 4am with an irrelevant megaphone announcement?</p>
<p>But what if there were not two, but 200 strangers?</p>
<p>…Why can’t I convince you? Okay, last try:</p>
<p>What if you all were sleeping in a moving object?</p>
<p>Going 700mph?</p>
<p>And everyone is suspended at 30,000 feet?</p>
<p>Yea, you’d like that? You’d pay a <em>lot</em> of money for that experience? Wow.</p>
<p>Well, I guess everybody has their limit.</p>

  <title>The Dove (Forevermore)</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A twist on “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven">The Raven</a>”, from <a href="../book-review/the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.html">The Best of Edgar Allen Poe</a>. Poe got it all wrong.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven">The Raven</a>” recently, take a moment first to remember, remember that Raven of yore.</p>
<section id="the-dove-forevermore" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>The Dove (Forevermore)</h1>
<p><em>A twist on “The Raven”</em> by Bryan Whiting</p>
<pre><code>Three A.M., I hear you wrapping.
Desitin, I keep slapping.
Diapers fresh, for poop, post napping.
Diapers fresh, for my Adore.

It was a cold and bleak December.
Dark and dreary, I remember.
Sleepless nights and occasional frights,    
I'd forgotten the parent's implore:
  please protect my Sweet Adore   

Nothing strange, just parents living.
Babies growing, always swimming
through the tides of life they're dipping,    
  dripping, 
    tripping, slick socks 
        slipping    
    lovey, pants, they all keep ripping    
"Will it stop?", my mind is tipping
I love them so, my Adore.   
But I just ask rest, I implore.    
Will I get it? 
  "Nevermore."    

What's that I hear, is something slapping?    
No! by Jove! A creature crapping!    
Crapping on my kitchen floor!! 
Right next to the. bathroom..door...
I just cannot believe for sure.
Not another chore.
I just mopped there, I can assure.
I feel denial swelling more.
  That creature must be 
    her 
  Adore.  

Then in Jan the rain starts stalling.  
On my chest, her eyes are falling,  
Napping, cooing, smiling, fawning,
My bedroom window, in Jan is calling
Calling in a creature, sure.

"What's this?" I wonder, as I slumber.
Is it just me, or am I dumber?    
Is that a bird?! What's that number? 
"Animal control!" I now thunder,
"For the dove! Not one mess more!!"
"Begone, you bird!" I implore!
It cocks its head, 
  "Nevermore."

Something changed, as I remember,
after that, cold, bleak December.
The sleep rolled in, and so I weather,
  weather just a little bit more.

The baby's coos I now see freshly.
The piqued smiles now enmesh me.
The drools of milk now refresh me.
"Refresh me, my Adore."
How could I ever
  have seen anything more?
    Please don't let it end, I implore.
The dove then whispers, 
  "Evermore."

The children calling, wailing, falling
at my feet, screaming, brawling,
incessant thumping, pounding, hounding,
  is pleasant to my ears once more.
Pleasant because they're my Adore.

I see it now, that bright December.
It wasn't dark, I now remember.
Just a dog, a fog, but nothing more. 
But now it's gone, and nevermore.
I took photos, Polaroids, sure.
But now it's gone. 
  And I want more. 

Remembered now are the cuddles.
Long forgotten: spilled milk puddles.
Spilled milk puddles are 
  nevermore. 

Days asleep and nights awake.
Dream eyes open, for goodness sake.
What I wouldn't give to take
another look at my Make.
Another look at 
    my 
  Adore.

When I could hold her, and nothing more. 
When in my hands, and on the floor
we cuddle, huddle, muddle more.
"Bring it back", I implore
"Turn back time", I plead pure.

Then entered in that dove once more, 
the welcomed bird, the dove of yore.
"The past is gone, time pressed its seal.
But yours to keep, for it is real
past and present, space time is traveled
In eternity, your gift unravels
  Forevermore."</code></pre>
<p>The tides of parenting are just phases. The good, the bad, the guilt, the love, the denial you even have kids to the overwhelming joy you could never express adequately in words…it all comes and goes - sometimes within the same hour.</p>
<p>Then suddenly we realize it’s all gone before we can blink.</p>
<p>The newborn is now walking at my feet. The eighteeen-month-old-diaper-generator is now riding his bike. The four-year-old brother slapper is now six and creating “Daddy, I love you” cards. Thankfully families are forevermore.</p>
<p><em>(Mostly) written 5:02am on Jan 5, 2024, after a sweet midnight feeding, where she cooed and smiled right before passing out peacefully on my chest.</em></p>

<p>Other lines…</p>
<pre><code>Pints of puke are never more
Once held lovey is now a bore
once scraped knees now never sore
going to the park now a chore</code></pre>

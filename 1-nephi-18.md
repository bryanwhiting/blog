# Scriptures

Nephi has two powerful verses about prayer:

> And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things.
> [1 Nephi 18.3](../scriptures/1-nephi-18.3)

When we pray often, we are shown great things. And then after he's tied up and being beaten by his brothers. According to what he wrote, this is the first thing he did when he was released:

> And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.
> [1 Nephi 18.21](../scriptures/1-nephi-18.21)

# Meaning

Do I turn to the Lord the moment something goes wrong? [Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols](christianity/turn-to-god-not-your-idols.md) The winds in our life can cease when we turn to God.

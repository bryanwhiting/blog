What is it about a new release that gets people excited? Would you buy software that never changes? How about a hammer?

Why are we okay with buying a hammer, but not stagnant software? Our culture is addicted to new widgets. A/B testing.

Software releases are free, but development is not. Therefore, research and development is constant, whereas the Hammer company hasn't needed to update its product in a couple...millennia. That's why they call it software. It's not hard to make. 

Is there a way to sell software like you sell a hammer?

No. Because per [Innovator's Dilemma](../book-review/innovators-dilemma.md), those who can out-do you will. And software is easy to alter and improve. I'm not convinced all "updates" done in the software industry are actually improvements, but people like change. Ever see a fashion line repeat itself?

Software is like fashion.

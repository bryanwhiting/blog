Working for a startup is like being a nanny. You can love it all you want, but it's not yours.

In the words of Michael Jackson: 

> Billie Jean is not my lover
> She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
> But the kid is not my son
> She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Always remember: unless you own it, the kid is not your son.

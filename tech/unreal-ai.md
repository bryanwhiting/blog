Now OpenAI is probably using reinforcement learning using physics engines. Meet Sora: [Sora](https://openai.com/sora).
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you think OpenAI Sora is a creative toy like DALLE, ... think again. Sora is a data-driven physics engine. It is a simulation of many worlds, real or fantastical. The simulator learns intricate rendering, &quot;intuitive&quot; physics, long-horizon reasoning, and semantic grounding, allâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/pRuiXhUqYR">pic.twitter.com/pRuiXhUqYR</a></p>&mdash; Jim Fan (@DrJimFan) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1758210245799920123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

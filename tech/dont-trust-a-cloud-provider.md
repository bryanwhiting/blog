Never trust a cloud provider to do compute for you, like AmazonForecast. (Or LLM tuning?)

Amazon will charge $1440, take 4.1 hours, and have an accuracy 3x worse than using an open source Nixtla, which cost $1.20, took 15 minutes and had an accuracy metric 1/3 the Amazon service offered (lower accuracy is good in this case.)

Where else are cloud providers ripping you off?

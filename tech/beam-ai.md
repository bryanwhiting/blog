# description

Runs GPT locally, has tons of templates, can interact with your screen. Run ChatGPT plus locally. 

I have not used it. Just thought it's cool. 
# commentary 
I don't see why Open AI can't build something like this, but they're focused on much higher value problems such as solving enterprise hunger. 

So we'll see niche tools like this that pop up and solve the needs of a few - satisfying the developer costs of some indie programmers. thinking of Innovators Dilemma, there's just not enough juice in this lemon for Open AI to squeeze, but plenty for a small fish.

Notes:

- The main breakthrough of TimeGPT is that it showed for the first time in the history of the field that the idea of a general pre-trained model was possible. In other words, TimeGPT is the first large-scale example of the transferability of time series models ready for production. We believe this marks a new chapter in the time series field, and we are extremely happy to see entities like Google (TimesFM), ServiceNow (LagLlama), Amazon (Chronos), Salesforce (Moirai), and CMU (Moment) following in our footsteps and contributing to this idea of pre-trained models for time series.

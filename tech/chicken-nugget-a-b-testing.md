Why cutting chicken nuggets for my 2y old is an optimization problem, and how social media companies use these principles:

Objective: maximize my 2 year olds caloric intake

- Inputs: chicken nugget size. 

- Cut two nuggets four ways: 8 pieces. 

- Cut two nuggets two ways: 4 pieces. 

Will the kid eat 5 small pieces or 3 big ones?

On one hand, he eats 62.5% of nuggets. On the other, 75%. But maybe he only eats two halves - that drops him to 50% consumption.

What gets you watching one more YouTube, one more Spotify song, one more TikTok? One more LinkedIn post?

Do people sign off after 5 posts? One post? If we slide a video into the fifth spot after the first four posts, do they engage? If they engage with the video do they come back tomorrow or in a week?

Everything's an optimization. Even cutting nuggets. Your mind just does this subconsciously.

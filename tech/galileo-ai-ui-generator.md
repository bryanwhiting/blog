I came across [Galileo AI](https://www.usegalileo.ai/). It lets you mock up UI interfaces. Great story in their blog: [Galileo AI - Feb 6 Launch Announcement](https://www.usegalileo.ai/blog/seed)

It doesn't export the code itself, but for a fee it'll export to Figma for you. The cool thing is they trained or fine tuned an LLM specifically on design components. This is a cool use case of how people with specialized skill sets will create custom LLMs to compete in areas ChatGPT won't be able to. 

This is also showing the emergence in new software: don't build a rules engine, train an LLM to solve the problem.

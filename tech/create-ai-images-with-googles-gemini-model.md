[Ethan Mollick on LinkedIn: I think that Google may have come out of nowhere to have the best LLMâ€¦ | 19 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_i-think-that-google-may-have-come-out-of-ugcPost-7162219043054170112-73pn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios)

[ImageFX](https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx#) Is the tool to generate images with Google's Gemini. I've been a huge fan of using ChatGPT on iOS to get images for this blog. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually good or not. But it's helped me associate a post with an idea (image), which I think is incredibly helpful for memory retention. So my theory has been: some content is better than no content. The other thought is: better learn now what these tools are and how to use them because you never know where you're going to be able to take them. They're like learning how to drive a car: if you can drive, you can go places. 

So how does ImageFX compare? Here's the prompt:

> a battle of chatgpt vs Google Gemini photo generators. Psychedelic. Parasitic. Enlightened. Groovy. Ethereal. Down to earth.

Google:

And ChatGPT:

This is but one test, and clearly chatGPT wins.

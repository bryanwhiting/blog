# There is Divine Discontent in the Consumer Appetite

Jeff Bezos alluded to the "divinely discontent" customer in a 2017 shareholder letter ([Elements of Amazonâ€™s Day 1 Culture | AWS Executive Insights](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/)).

> One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static â€“ they go up. Itâ€™s human nature. We didnâ€™t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterdayâ€™s â€˜wowâ€™ quickly becomes todayâ€™s â€˜ordinaryâ€™. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before

More googling shows the phrase was also used by Neal A Maxwell in 1976 ([Notwithstanding My Weakness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng)):

> What can we do to manage these vexing feelings of inadequacy? Here are but a few suggestions: (1) We can distinguish more clearly between **divine discontent** and the devilâ€™s dissonance, between dissatisfaction with self and disdain for self. We need the first and must shun the second, remembering that when conscience calls to us from the next ridge, it is not solely to scold but also to beckon.

(Just dropping that in case Bezos gets all the credit for the term ðŸ˜‰.)

# LLM Discontent

People grappling with building LLMs are facing this discontent at an alarming rate. The [LLM Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](llm-chatbot-arena-leaderboard.md) is a testament to how quickly appetites will change. Many AI tool providers refrain from vendor lock in and try to build LLM agnostic tooling. 

How do you compete? Well, most of us aren't building these foundational models. How do they compete with each other? None of us care. We just want a good one. 

But ask yourself, would you rather have Bard from today or nothing from 2022?

These leaderboards are fascinating because in 14 months since ChatGPT emerged we've become so reliant on these tools but yet they're not even old enough to walk or talk by human standards. Yet we now have Bard, ChatGPT, LLaMA, Mistral, Claude, and whatever's cooking at Amazon/Apple/Microsoft (behind the scenes as a contingency plan I'm sure) and the Chinese/Indian companies that don't want to rely on the U.S.  

It's the early days of search: Yahoo, AOL, Ask Jeeves, etc. One will emerge as your favorite perhaps, like how we all use Google even though Bing probably isn't that bad anymore (I wouldn't know...).[^1]

Point is: it's a race to the bottom, the customer is fickle. They know this, which is why they keep releasing new stuff every 6 months. 

Point is: as you build your LLM application, your customer will be divinely discontent with *you*. This is nothing knew, it's just the age of software development. 

Expectations of what software can do are rising. Those expectations are becoming indiscernible from the magic that software is becoming.

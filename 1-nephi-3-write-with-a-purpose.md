The Book of Mormon has a purpose:

> I have received a commandment of the Lord that I should make these plates, for the special purpose that there should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people.
> [1 Nephi 9.3](../scriptures/1-nephi-9.3)

![Write with a purpose. Journal with a purpose. ](img/dalle-writing-on-gold-plates.jpeg){.preview-image}

Then the other plates had a different purpose:

> the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions of my people.
> [1 Nephi 9.4](../scriptures/1-nephi-9.4)

What purpose does my writing have? What is the purpose of this blog?

When we write, it helps to have a purpose. It guides the writing. How does writing for entertainment differ from writing to try to change someone's life by inviting them to Christ? The Book of Mormon is written for the later. 

Let us write. Write with a purpose.

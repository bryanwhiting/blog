# Scriptures

> The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
> [2 Nephi 21.6](../scriptures/2-nephi-21.6)

# Meaning

What does this mean to me? 

- Right now the wolf and the lamb do not rest together. Be cautious. The adversary seeks to sift like wheat. 
- Peace is coming. The end is known. 

What have Christians to fear?

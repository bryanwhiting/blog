# Scriptures

Lehi, now in America after a long journey, sits his son, Jacob, down for a chat. He told him all his hard times would be rewarded:

> Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall **consecrate** thine afflictions for thy gain.
> [2 Nephi 2.2](../scriptures/2-nephi-2.2)

This reminds me of:

> I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will **consecrate** thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul. 
> [2-nephi-32.9](../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9.md) 

To consecrate is to "make or declare something sacred" (Oxford), or "to devote or dedicate exclusively to a purpose".

From this lens, Jacob's trials (like all his brothers and sisters) could be declared sacred (for the purposes of the Lord) and dedicated to the Lord's purposes and cause. 

Likewise, through prayer we can consecrate all of our acts. We can make them sacred devotions. What would your life be like if every day you dedicated it to the Lord? Where you did everything with a sacred purpose and cause?

And what if He made all those things consecrated for your spiritual gain?

# Meaning

I can find more ways to consecrate my day and actions. To give myself with greater purpose.

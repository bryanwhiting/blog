# Scriptures

Nephi sees what happens to his people 600 years into the future. They suffer a lot, and are almost destroyed. 

> But the Son of Righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness.
> [2 Nephi 26.9](../scriptures/2-nephi-26.9)

# Meaning

The Savior heals. He is the One Who Comes. Who has come. Who will come. 

It doesn't matter anymore to me *when* he'll return. Just *that* he's retuning. This is a beautiful perspective.

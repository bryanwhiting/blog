Today is #Easter, the most important holiday of the year for Christians, and perhaps the most radical and profound holiday for the world. It shows the most #inclusive 

On this day, nearly 2,000 years ago, it is believed that Jesus Christ, considered the Son of God, resurrected from the tomb. He was the first to rise from the dead, and then gave power to others to resurrect. 

Consider the hope this offers. Death is only momentary. Everlasting life awaits for us all. 

Here's what Jesus did that was incredibly kind, selfless and #inclusive:

- He first appeared to Mary, a woman. He frequently "broke the rules" by spending time with those society marginalized, and forgiving the sins of people worthy of death. 
- He told his followers to share His gospel with the world. It was no longer restricted to just the Israelites (of which Jews are one of twelve houses)
- He shared the gospel with the dead, who live as spirits on the other side. He freed the captive spirits.

![The Scriptures are precious and worth our time](../img/dalle-white-fruit-delicious-zoom-in.jpeg){.preview-image}

Nephi recounts how they had obtained some scriptures:

> And **we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us**, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.
> [1 Nephi 5.21](../scriptures/1-nephi-5.21)

A few things that stand out to me:

- He thought about his children. In [2 Nephi 25.26](../scriptures/2-nephi-25.26) it's mentioned "that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins."
- They had the scriptures because they accomplished the task laid before them, "I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them." [1 Nephi 3.7](../scriptures/1-nephi-3.7.md) 
- These scriptures were "desirable". Know what else is desirable? The fruit of the tree of life:

> And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.
> [1 Nephi 8.10](../scriptures/1-nephi-8.10)

The scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, are precious to help our families know of Christ, have been obtained and written by those obedient to Christ, and are desirable and great to consume. 

In [A Knife to a Gun Fight: Why I'm off Social Media](../tech/a-knife-to-a-gun-fight.md), I talk about how tech workers talk of social media as "snackable content". Frequently the word "consumption" is used to describe how app "users" "consume" content. 

It's mostly not the stuff worth consuming in great quantities. Don't settle for snacks. Enjoy a feast:

> Wherefore, do not spend **money** for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and **feast upon that which perisheth not**, neither can be corrupted, and **let your soul delight in fatness.**
> [2 Nephi 9.51](../scriptures/2-nephi-9.51)

*Replace "money" with "time".*

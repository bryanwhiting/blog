The Book of Mormon is the most powerful book I've read. 

This is how I get the most out of the book:

> I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye **must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father** in the name of Christ, that **he will consecrate thy performance unto thee**, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.
> [2 Nephi 32.9](../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9)

I've read a lot of self help books. It's not like that.  This is a book that inspires personal revelation and a relationship with Christ and Heavenly Father. I get the most out of it when I have a true desire in my heart:

> And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a **sincere heart, with real intent,** having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
> [Moroni 10.4](../scriptures/moroni-10.4)

When I read it in a rush, I don't get much out of it. When I don't pray before hand, or if I'm not sincere, I don't really get anything substantive. 

It's like texting vs calling a friend. If you're in a rush, you give a half thought text. But if you're on a long drive and want to build a relationship, you give the friend a call.

The best insight doesn't come from the Book of Mormon. It comes from the Holy Ghost. So I can read the book as a literary critique and not see its divinity. But as I read it trying to build a relationship with Heavenly Father, then I feel that relationship grow. 

> Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be **planted in your heart**, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselvesâ€”It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it **beginneth to be delicious to me.**

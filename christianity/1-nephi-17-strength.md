# Scriptures

Consider how the Lord provided for Nephi and his people 

> And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.  
> And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he **doth nourish them, and strengthen them**, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness.
> [1 Nephi 17.2â€“3](../scriptures/1-nephi-17.2-3)

# Meaning

The Lord intends to strengthen me to overcome the trials ahead, not to take them away. The purpose of the life is to be strengthen. Whenever we feel overwhelmed, we can take those things to the Lord.

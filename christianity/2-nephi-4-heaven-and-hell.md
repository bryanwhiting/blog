# Scriptures

This quote focuses on the dichotomy people feel as they draw closer to Christ. First, they have the desire. Second, they have positive experiences. Third, they doubt their worthiness. Or they wish that all the good things could prevent them from sinning again:

> O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions?  27 And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy?
> [2 Nephi 4.26â€“27](../scriptures/2-nephi-4.26-27)

# Meaning

The Lord wants us to grow. Sometimes that involves choosing to see the good in an experience.

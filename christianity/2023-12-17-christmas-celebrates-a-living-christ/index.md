# Old news

Elder Neil Anderson's invitation here is worth listening to. It's an invitation to ponder the reality of the birth of our Savior. It's rather simple, but it evokes a profound question we should all consider. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How wonderful it is to celebrate the birth of our Savior and Redeemer.

# Did He come?

Nothing Elder Anderson shares here is new. It's rather repetitive. Same old story. Same-old old-guy telling me to believe in a Jesus. 

If you consider the most currently interesting things in this world, Artificial Intelligence, some may tell you that there exists a future utopia where we're supported by infinitely intelligent digital agents who can solve complex world problems and bring us to...utopia. 

Ok. We've also heard this before. The Tower of Babel tried to approximate heaven, and now humanity is trying to approximate Godlike intelligence. 

The void of Christ in one's life produces a desire to create Christ. A savior. Something to literally save us from our woes.

Let's be real. I'm a tech optimist. I say bring it on. But I'm also a Christian. In my view, the most important question isn't "what will AGI do to/for humanity?" Instead, the most important question is "was Jesus Christ the promised messiah?"

If Christ came, and was indeed the prophesied Christ, then all of life's ultimate questions are already answered. 

- Why are we here? To die and be resurrected to live again. 

- Where did we come from? The same place He came from: the presence of God. 

- Who are we? We are sons and daughters of God worth saving. 

Yes, the questions are already answered: it doesn't matter what happens with AI. Because the end is known: the Lord will come again. 

Let us treasure this time to reflect on a Savior who already came. Who lives. Who loves us beyond mortal (or AI) comprehension. 

# What can we do?

Let's take a moment, perhaps an hour, to consider the miracle of Christmas:

A great quote leading up to MLK Jr day:

> Behold I have dreamed a dream
> [1 Nephi 3.2](../scriptures/1-nephi-3.2)

Lehi dreamed many dreams. It got him in trouble with his boys, as Laman and Lemuel "did murmur in many things against their father, **because he was a visionary man**" ([1 Nephi 2.11](../scriptures/1-nephi-2.11)).

Lehi's wife, Sariah, also murmured against him, "she also had complained against my father,  **telling him that he was a visionary man;** saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness." ([1 Nephi 5.2](../scriptures/1-nephi-5.2))

Lehi's response to this is great: 

> I **know that I am a visionary man**; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren. But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness.
> [1 Nephi 5.4â€“5](../scriptures/1-nephi-5.4-5)

This response teaches me a few things:

- when people struggle, they can complain against a good thing and make it a bad thing. "Why do you always have to be such a goodie two shoes?"
- The response is "if I weren't such a goodie two shoes I'd be miserable". Helps remind people of the value of their own biases. 

Complaining is a natural part of life. Just be careful what you complain about.

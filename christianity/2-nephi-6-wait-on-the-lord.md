# Scriptures

Two scriptures stand out in 2 Nephi 6:

> for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
> [2 Nephi 6.7](../scriptures/2-nephi-6.7)

And

> for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people. For thus saith the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth with thee
> [2 Nephi 6.17](../scriptures/2-nephi-6.17)

The implication of "wait" means that not all things happen in the time table that we want to expect it to happen on. It's important we don't lose faith when what we perceive should be the timeline ends up not being the Lord's timeline. 
# Meaning

Challenges come and go in life. What do we do when the Lord doesn't turn back the challenge immediately? Do we "wait" to see His deliverance?

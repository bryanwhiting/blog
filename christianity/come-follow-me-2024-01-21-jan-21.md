# Summary

These chapters teach me:

- how to overcome adversity (prayer)
- Some people never change (Laman and Lemuel)
- People who don't like the message usually reject it and denounce it (Laman and Lemuel)
- The love of God is accessible to all
- The Lord invites all, even if He knows they won't listen
- Those who come can fully appreciate the beauty of the Lord's love
- If you take your eyes off the Savior, and care what people think instead, you can feel shame which can drive you to leave Him
- The scriptures are written with a specific purpose: they don't know. They're doing what the Lord wants them to do. 
- The Lord will teach those about the Tree of Life who want to know about it. Nephi wasn't any more special than anyone else. He just wanted to know. 
- The Lord works through prophets. Through the priesthood. 
- Perhaps Lehi could have been more gentle with Laman and Lemuel. But Nephi *did* mention the "tender feelings" that Lehi had for them, so maybe Laman and Lemuel just didn't get it
- There's a little bit of Laman and Lemuel and Nephi and Sam and Lehi and Sariah in all of us. 
- Over time, the prophecies are revealed and fulfilled.

# Activity Ideas

- "let me see" ([1 Nephi 11.1](../scriptures/1-nephi-11.1.md)) - show a video to one kid, have him share or try to draw it. Have others try to understand. They just have to see for themselves. 
- Iron rod activity: blindfold.

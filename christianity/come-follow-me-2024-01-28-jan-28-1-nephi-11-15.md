# Focus Scriptures 

## Covenant Armor

> " And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; **and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory."** ([1 Nephi 14.14](../scriptures/1-nephi-14.14))

## Protection through the Word of God

> And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree?  24 And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and **would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness**, to lead them away to destruction.  25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.
> [1 Nephi 15.23–25](../scriptures/1-nephi-15.23-25)

## Armor of God
> 10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.  11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;  15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;  16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:  18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
> [Ephesians 6.10–18](../scriptures/ephesians-6.10-18)

# Alpha and Omega

- Why would Christ use these words? They're Greek. Why not Hebrew?

> [Romans 1:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/1?id=p16&lang=eng#p16) For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

This teaches me that Christ speaks the language of those whom he's speaking to.

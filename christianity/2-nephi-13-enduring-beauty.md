# Scriptures

While this scripture is sad, it tells some important truths:

> In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon;  19 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers;  20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings;  21 The rings, and nose jewels;  22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins;  23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils.  24 And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty.  25 Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war.
> [2 Nephi 13.18–25](../scriptures/2-nephi-13.18-25)

This lists out all the things we think are so important, but really at the end of the day are meaningless:

- Our dress
- our decorations and fine things
- Our hair
- Our beauty
# Meaning

Beauty is a closeness with the Lord. Adhering to His gospel. 

> And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!  16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace!  17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever!  18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people;
> [Mosiah 15.15–18](../scriptures/mosiah-15.15-18)

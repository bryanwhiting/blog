# Scriptures

> I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you. Behold, who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of man, who shall die, and of the son of man, who shall be made like unto grass?
> [2 Nephi 8.12](../scriptures/2-nephi-8.12)

# Meaning

I remember reading this scripture when I was younger and just loving the concept: why be afraid? Compared to God, we are like blades of grass. Our problems too. If He created the earth, surely he can help us.

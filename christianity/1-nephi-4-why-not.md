Nephi asks a faith-opening question:

> for behold he is mightier than all the earth, **then why not mightier than** Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?
> [1 Nephi 4.1](../scriptures/1-nephi-4.1)

As I wrote in [An Unknown God](unknown-god.md), Nephi demonstrates the ability to find a way with his questioning. Instead of asking doubtfully, he asks faithfully. 

It reminds me of Enoch:

> 31 And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord, saying: **Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight**, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?  32 And the Lord said unto Enoch: **Go forth and do** as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee.
> [Moses 6.31â€“32](../scriptures/moses-6.31-32)

The Lord didn't tell him why he was chosen. He just said "go forth". 

The Lord's thoughts are above our thoughts. Too often we put limiting beliefs on ourselves - I'm not good enough, why me? Or, why would God want to help me?

Why not instead ask, "why *wouldn't* Heavenly Father want to help me? He loves me and has promised he *would* help me. "

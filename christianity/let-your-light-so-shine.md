When Christ was teaching his disciples, he invited them to share their light to the world. But then he elaborated in an interesting way:

> [3rd Nephi 18:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?id=p24&lang=eng#p24) Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold upâ€”that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed.

The Lord is their light. He is our light. He is the light we hold up to the world and let shine. He is our light that we let shine. 

The pronouns here are impactful by their implication:

1. He assumes we have light
2. He assumes we have Him as our light
3. He invites us to share the light we possess
4. The light we possess is His light
5. But it is ours. And it is his. Our light is His light. His light is our light. 

"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works...". Read in this new way: obtain the Lord as your light. Then shine His light before men.

The modern refrain is to do and be whatever you want. While I largely agree with this refrain, there are some caveats: certain things bring us happiness. Being kind to people. Helping people. Saying sorry, etc. 

> And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and **leadeth them away into broad roads**, that they perish and are lost.
> [1 Nephi 12.17](../scriptures/1-nephi-12.17)

![All the roads we can take can confuse us. Instead, we can focus on where we're heading](../img/dalle-image-a-hill-with-a-tree-at-the-top-a-lot-of-broad-roads-at-the-base-of-the-hill-heading-down-strange-paths.jpeg){.preview-image}

The temptation we all face is to be lured down broad roads. By contrast, the way of the Lord is the straight and narrow. 

Once I was working with someone and I was writing my code a few ways, with a bunch of tries that had failed. I finally kept the right one along side the failures. The reviewer said "why do you keep this junk?" I thought; because it helps me remember the way to not do it. "Why not just keep the answer though?"

Sometimes we like to focus on the "broad" roads in a few ways. 

1. Remember all our failings, rather than focus on the things that bring us happiness. We do this as a badge of "I don't want to repeat those bad mistakes." Sure, the intent is good, but that's like carrying a broken phone around with you to remind you not to drop your phone again. The effect is far more positive if we focus on the good things that come from following Christ. 
2. There are a lot of paths we can go down in life. The Lord wants us to do many good things! ([Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols](turn-to-god-not-your-idols.md)). But there are a few roads he doesn't want us to go down: selfishness, greed, love of money, etc. These roads are broad. There are a lot of ways to lose yourself. 

So remember, "focus on the right answer". Focus on the Savior, and walk towards him. Drop your load at his feet ([Matthew 11.28â€“30](../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30.md)).

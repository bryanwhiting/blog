I want these young men to come away with an appreciation for the restoration of the gospel and how the Book of Mormon plays a role in their lives. 

How do I get a seven year old class to appreciate the Book of Mormon? The restoration?

# Scriptures

> And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
> [2 Nephi 27.3](../scriptures/2-nephi-27.3)


The Lord won't help us unless we act in faith:

> For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith.
> [2 Nephi 27.23](../scriptures/2-nephi-27.23)


# Lesson

Know: What the apostasy is. What a prophet is. 
Feel: that they're alive at a special time. 
Do: ask Heavenly Father if this church is the true church. And keep asking. 

Activity:
- apostasy. 
	- Every boy is a prophet. 
	- They need to invite people to repent. Repent and come unto Jesus. 
	- Everyone else throws things at them. 
- Ask: who would you rather be - the one listening or preaching? 
- Have a pause for one minute of silence for how long the time was that they didn't have a prophet.

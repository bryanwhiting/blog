I've been a member of this church, also known as the Mormon church, my whole life. I've studied it, learned its history, and have come to believe that it provides a marvelous sense of purpose and guidance. I believe it teaches the most truth about Jesus Christ and His plan of happiness for us, and I believe it's people (including my own) have a lot to learn from those teachings.

This is an interesting scripture:

> and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit. And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost. (1 Nephi 8:27-28)

Imagine you're eating at a Michelin star restaurant and across the street there's a food court at the mall with a bunch of people eating McDonalds and Burger King. And they're mocking you. 

Reasons this relationship is so fascinating:

- the people in the building don't know what the tree tastes like. 
- The people in the building are far away. 
- The people eating the fruit are able to be numbed by the perceptions of others, and aren't focusing on their own experience. 

If they had focused on their own experiences it would have been delicious.

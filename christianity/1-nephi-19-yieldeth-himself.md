# Scriptures

On Sunday I was thinking about [Bread given freely, like His life](../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.md). It's powerful to read this verse today:

> And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, **yieldeth himself**, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel.
> [1 Nephi 19.10](../scriptures/1-nephi-19.10)

Also [Bread in the Oven](../sacrament-symbols/bread-in-the-oven.md) post touches here. 

He gave His life freely. He yielded himself. 

So much doctrine is packed in this one verse:

- Christ had all power. He was a deity. 
- He obeyed the father. 
- He fulfilled prophesy. 
- He was the God of Abraham. He is distinct from the Father. 
- It was prophesied he would resurrect. Prophets in America knew this. 
- There is a space between death and the resurrection. Christ lived in that space for 3 days. 
- There are prophets who have testified of the Lord whom we don't have records from. 
- Jesus delivered the Israelites. â†’ the Israelites then delivered him unto the cross.

# Meaning

Every scripture in the Book of Mormon can contain some or many truths about the Savior. There's always something to learn. 

Humility is the process of putting the Lord's wishes above my own, as He put the Father's wishes above perhaps his own (yet they are one).

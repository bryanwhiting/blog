# Scriptures

> And the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory of Zion shall be a defence.
> [2 Nephi 14.5](../scriptures/2-nephi-14.5)

# Meaning

The Lord seeks to offer individualized guidance, the way that He provides guidance for the group. Fire to light the way, smoke to shield you from the past.

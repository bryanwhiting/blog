# Scriptures

The Lord reminds us he had not forgotten us:

> But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me—but he will show that he hath not.  15 For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.  16 Behold, I **have graven thee upon the palms of my hands**; thy walls are continually before me.
> [1 Nephi 21.14–16](../scriptures/1-nephi-21.14-16)

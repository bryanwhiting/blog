# Scriptures

> In the same way, the Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, “doubting nothing.” Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith. I promise that you can experience for yourself that Jesus Christ “giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.” Few things will accelerate your spiritual momentum more than realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life.

# Meaning

Reading this gives me pause. I have always thought not to seek for signs. "A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh signs " or what not. But this is different. This is seeking miracles, which is the Lord's hand in our life. 

If I seek a miracle, I seek Jesus' hand in my life. His healing. His advice. His teachings. Those are and were His miracles.

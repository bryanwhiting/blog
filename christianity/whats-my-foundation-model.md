# Scriptures

Thinking on [A foundation on Christ](a-foundation-on-christ.md), I wondered: what is my "foundation model?"

# Meaning

In machine learning there's all this talk of foundation models. If you have a bad foundation model, you can't build good software. 

Likewise, the quality of a prediction system is in the data. And in the model. And upon that I can build a system. 

And the quality of my testimony is based on how much I put Christ as my guide, inspiration, and foundation.

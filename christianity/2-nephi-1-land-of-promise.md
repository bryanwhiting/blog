# Scriptures: A Land of Promise

I thought about the phrase "land of promise" in [1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land](1-nephi-2-receiving-a-promised-land.md) and there's the verse in [1 Nephi 5.5](../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5.md) where Lehi says "I have obtained a land of promise". He says that years before arriving in the promised land. 

But now, years later, he testifies:

> notwithstanding our afflictions, **we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands**; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.
> [2 Nephi 1.5](../scriptures/2-nephi-1.5)

How long did it take for them to receive that land? Many years. And many hardships. Lehi complained and was chastised at some point (1 Nephi 16). So the journey isn't without its struggles.

# Meaning

The Lord is with us. Even if we complain and struggle, He wants to help us get to a better place, our promised lands. 

We can be like Lehi and seek to obtain that personal vision.  And receive a personal covenant of how the Lord wants to bless us in our lives.

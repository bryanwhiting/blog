# Scriptures

Nephi explains why he writes the words of Isaiah in his record:

> For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for **he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him**. And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.
> [2 Nephi 11.2â€“3](../scriptures/2-nephi-11.2-3)

First, he read the words and enjoyed reading them. Second, he identified with Isaiah - he felt a common bond with him, namely that they had both seen the Redeemer. Third, He wants to establish a testimony to his posterity by saying "Isaiah saw it, but Jacob and I did too. And there will be others as well."

# Meaning

Can I say I've seen my Redeemer?

Nephi wasn't Moses. He wasn't the son of Moses. He was the son of a dad who was called to preach to people. There were many prophets like Lehi, per 1 Nephi 1. But Lehi was chosen to leave. Nephi was diligent in His duties. 

Seeing the Redeemer is a spiritual event. Moroni was visited by the Lord, "And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus." ([Mormon 1.15](../scriptures/mormon-1.15))

If we recall, many were visited by Jesus and saw him with their physical eyes and didn't recognize Him ([Matthew 16.15-17](../scriptures/matthew-16.15-17.md)).

Then there was King Lamoni who also experienced a spiritual witness of the Lord: "For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have **seen my Redeemer**; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name." ([Alma 19.13](../scriptures/alma-19.13)) Was King Lamoni a prophet? No. A week before this spiritual experience he was sentencing his servants to death for not taking good enough care of his flocks. 

I'm not sure there is a pre-requisite to "seeing" the Lord. I'm also not sure that seeing him with your literal eyes is important at all. But gaining a witness from the Holy Ghost that Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Chosen One on whom we rely on for forgiveness...this is what matters. If ye seek, ye shall find.

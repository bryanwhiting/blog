At least a dozen people claimed to have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith. 

There were the "Three Witnesses", the "Eight Witnesses", Emma Smith, Joseph Smith, and perhaps a few others. 

What's powerful to me is this testimony that the Eight shared:

> And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.
> [Testimony of Eight Witnesses](../scriptures/testimony-of-eight-witnesses)

I admire any who live with such conviction. It calls to mind the John Hancock's of the world. 

> Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come:
> [Testimony of Eight Witnesses](../scriptures/testimony-of-eight-witnesses) 

We're invited to "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in," ([Mosiah 18.9](../scriptures/mosiah-18.9)), to share what we've seen. 

May we stand boldly, which doesn't mean confrontational, contentiously, or loudly. It just means unequivocally. Sincerely.

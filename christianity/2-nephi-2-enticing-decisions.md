# Scriptures

What's enticing you right now?

> Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.
> [2 Nephi 2.16](../scriptures/2-nephi-2.16)

Can you make a decision without being presented at least two options?

If you feel like you made a decision on something, what did you decide and what was the alternative option?

If you're torn about a decision, why? What's on the other side?

# Meaning

Life is full of enticing things. Sometimes, self defeating thoughts can be enticing. We have a bias towards negativity as humans. But thankfully we always have a choice. 

Recognize the behavior. And then find the perhaps less *enticing* but far more healthy thought pattern.

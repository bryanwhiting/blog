While Lehi wandered in the wilderness, Nephi recounted he left the "land of his inheritance":

> And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him,
> [1 Nephi 2.4](../scriptures/1-nephi-2.4)

Yet by the end of the Chapter, Nephi is promised a land of inheritance:

> And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.
> [1 Nephi 2.20](../scriptures/1-nephi-2.20)

Amazing how they lose one thing but gain another. Also amazing is how they had prophets warning them of Jerusalem's destruction - why didn't the Lord make *those* prophets leave? 

He has a plan for us individually.

CS Lewis remarked something along the lines of "We don't chase God, God chases us".

> Both Malcolm Muggeridge and C.S. Lewis attest to this. Muggeridge wrote, “I had a notion that somehow, besides questing, I was being pursued.” Lewis said that, “…night after night…I sensed the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. Finally, I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed…” ([link](https://www.stettlerindependent.com/community/man-can-not-sidestep-thinking-about-god-faith-and-reflection-6606319), also discussed in [The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle](../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.md))

# Scriptures

> Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to **provoke him** to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and **view his death,** and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.
> [Jacob 1.8](../scriptures/jacob-1.8)

Christ was clearly angry when he flipped the market at the temple. And it's said he's a "jealous" God and has his wrath and such. 

God won't be mocked. But he's the first to love and forgive us. So when we bring upon us his wrath, I see this as we're bringing upon ourselves the consequences of our own actions. The wrath was determined when He made the law. But it's better said "we bring upon ourselves the wrath of breaking his commandments" than "provoke him to anger", for Charity sufferers long and is Kind and is not easily provoked. For He is Charity. 

# Meaning

It's much healthier for me to see the commandments as immutable as gravity. Drop something, it'll brake. Face the wrath of the hardwood floor. But God is quite in control. Quite loving. Quite fair and just.

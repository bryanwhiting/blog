# Scriptures

Today in Sunday school we studied Helaman 5:12:

> 12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.
> [Helaman 5.12](../scriptures/helaman-5.12)



# Meaning

In reading [Thinking, Fast and Slow](../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.md), a big section is dedicated to the tale of two selves: the experiencing self and the remembering self. 

The peak-end bias is that despite enjoying several hours or years of an experience, we only remember the high and the end. This happens in movies - if you don't like how it ends you hate the movie. If you don't like the bill you won't remember the food you just ate. 

I was sick this week, laying on the ground unable to move much with some food poisoning. I said a prayer to have a positive experience, or to learn something.  And I did! While sick I was just impressed at how my body was able to instinctively know what to do to fight the illness. 

And now I look back and I'm almost glad I had that experience. It taught me some important things. 

That's the power I've felt of building a foundation on Christ. When I'm challenged, I know I can seek the Lord (it's easier to remember this with a physical sickness than many other things in life). And when I do, He both helps the experiencing self and the remembering self. He consecrates those experiences for our good [2-nephi-32.9](../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9.md) .

> he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.

He will consecrate both hard and good things for our good.

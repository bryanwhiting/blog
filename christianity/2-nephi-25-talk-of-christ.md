# Scriptures

There is one purpose of a law: to prevent something. Or to ensure something happens. But you really can't prevent bad things from happening by creating a law because laws are just rules. They define what's bad. 

Consider the law of Moses. It defined what was bad. The Ten Commandments. The ordinances. The many rituals and performances. 

But the law was dead. 

> And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled.
> [2 Nephi 25.24](../scriptures/2-nephi-25.24)

> For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the **law hath become dead** unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.  26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.
> [2 Nephi 25.25â€“26](../scriptures/2-nephi-25.25-26)

Forgetting even the spirit of the law, we can just focus on Christ. Just men need no law.
# Meaning

The goal of following Christ isn't to follow him. It's to become like him. To experience what He experienced. To feel what He felt. The law is dead once you know that and pursue that.

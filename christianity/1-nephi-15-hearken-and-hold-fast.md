Who do we listen to?

> And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.
> [1 Nephi 15.24](../scriptures/1-nephi-15.24)

To learn biology, do you go to the math teacher? To learn happiness, perhaps the Source of truth and light can be our Teacher. 

Once we learn truth, everything else becomes a lot more clear. And once we know what clear looks like, we don't heed the distracting darts. 

1. Hearken (listen, read, pay attention to, follow)
2. Hold fast (appreciate, come back to daily)

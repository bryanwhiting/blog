As people, we are consistently imperfect:

> Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer.
> [1 Nephi 10.6](../scriptures/1-nephi-10.6)

The blessing of this imperfection is a constant reminder that to become who we need to, we need to rely on the Savior. 

This isn't a one-time thing. Perhaps it's like walking up a slippery hill. There are grips on our knee pads, but not on our shoes. 

Kneel in prayer to rely on the Redeemer.

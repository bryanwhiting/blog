Obtaining the love of Christ is not easy:

> I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree.
> [1 Nephi 8.24](../scriptures/1-nephi-8.24)

Now, He loves us unconditionally. But it is up to us to come to Him. 

He constantly invites us to come to Him, and because He gives us agency ([Stop trying to change people. Stop it.](stop-trying-to-change-people.md)), we have to choose to follow Him. 

This choice isn't an easy one. It's a difficult one. Some of us get tired and let go. Or we get distracted by all there is around us. Whatever the case - God's love for us is constant. It's there. It's available. It's at the tree. It's felt through meaningful prayer ([The Power of Habitual Prayer](the-power-of-habitual-prayer.md)). It's felt through studying His words. It's by building a relationship that we come to Him. It's hard work, but it's the way we experience the delicious fruit.

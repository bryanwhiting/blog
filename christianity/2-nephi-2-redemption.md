# Scriptures

Notice the words "in" and "through":

> Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.
> [2 Nephi 2.6](../scriptures/2-nephi-2.6)

This provides some meaningful words. Rambling a bit here:

- in: because of?
- through: by means of

How are these two words different? One, Christ is a Being. He's not an "amorphous entity". By means of what He did for us, we can be redeemed. But it's also because of who He is (presently as the Living Christ) in granting us forgiveness.

# Meaning

Christ's atonement is infinite. It's empowering to know that he's already suffered for my sins of today and yesterday as well as tomorrow and beyond. Meaning, he already knows the mistakes I'm going to choose to make, which is kind of trippy in a way, but also comforting thinking about how He still loves me and knows how I'll falter. That brings me peace knowing He knows me, who I am today, who I'll develop into tomorrow.

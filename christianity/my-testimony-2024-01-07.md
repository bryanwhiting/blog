*Today is fast Sunday, a day when testimonies are shared in church. Here's my testimony I shared today. Someone had just spoken about moving to a new place and seeing God in their lives, even if it was far away from where they had thought they needed to be. They had moved away from family.*

I was reminded today of why I live where I do. Without going into personal details, as a family we decided it was time to leave the east coast and move west. As I wondered how it might be possible, I was encouraged by my wife to reach out to an old contact on a random spreadsheet I had kept seven years prior when I was first looking for jobs. The guy had since changed jobs from when he had interviewed me, but he referred me to his new company. 

Well, this company was otherwise impossible to get noticed at, even with referrals. Turns out this guy was a lot higher than I had known. It was enough to get me the first interview. Four years later we're still on the west coast. It's definitely a better situation for our family in many ways.

And in terms of family, I grew up living far away from cousins. My church congregation became my family. My parents friends became my Sunday school teachers and mentors. My friends at church became my closest confidants and kept me company in living the principles I believed in.  

Recently, this church family helped us with meals, gifts, and emotional warmth. I don't know what I'd do without belonging to a group of people who care for one another (I know many communities are like this, but I think it's extra special in a Christian context where everyone wants to help and strengthen each other in kindness. We all try their best.)

Christ's design that we have a church is inspired:

> There is **one body, and one Spirit**, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;  One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
> [Ephesians 4.4–6](../scriptures/ephesians-4.4-6)

And are we not all family? The spiritual children of Christ and sons and daughters of Heavenly Father. 

> And now, because of the covenant which ye have made **ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters;** for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.   ... therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ...
> [Mosiah 5.7–8](../scriptures/mosiah-5.7-8)

I testify the [Hand of God](../concepts/hand-of-god.md) is real. He leads and guides people to where they need to be gathered. And when we gather together as one body, miracles happen.

I also love this scripture, how Lehi was guided to a "land of promise". 

> behold, I **have obtained** a land of promise
> [1 Nephi 5.5](../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5)

He wrote "have obtained" while he was struggling for food and water in the desert. He saw ahead to when he'd eventually live in a near rain forest paradise.

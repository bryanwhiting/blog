# Scriptures

> Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, **shall grow together**, unto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.
> [2 Nephi 3.12](../scriptures/2-nephi-3.12)

The scriptures will grow together over time. 

- Do we use the scriptures, both the Book of Mormon and the Bible, to lay down false doctrines and contentions?
- Do we seek these books to understand true doctrine?

# Meaning

I can apply this in my own life by seeking to use the scriptures to address false beliefs in my life. To challenge the thoughts of the day.

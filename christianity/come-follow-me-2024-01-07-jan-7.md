# Keystone Activity (10m)

Bring magnitiles. Have them try to build a triangle without any supporting pieces. 

Test the strength of their creations. Pull out one piece and see if it falls.

:::

Goal: spiritual closeness with the Savior every day. 

> The voices and pressures of the world are engaging and numerous. But too many voices are deceptive, seductive, and can pull us off the covenant path. To avoid the inevitable heartbreak that follows, I plead with you today to counter the lure of the world by **making time for the Lord in your life—each and every day.**
> ["Make Time for the Lord", Russell M. Nelson](../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-make-time-for-the-lord)

Read the Book of Mormon every day 

> My dear brothers and sisters, **I promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon every day, you will make better decisions—every day**. I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life. I promise that as you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized against the evils of the day, even the gripping plague of pornography and other mind-numbing addictions.

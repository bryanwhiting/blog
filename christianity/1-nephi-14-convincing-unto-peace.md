The Lord gives unto us according to our desires:

> For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a great and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the otherâ€”either to **the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal**, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of which I have spoken.
> [1 Nephi 14.7](../scriptures/1-nephi-14.7)

Remember that He cannot take away our agency. So he doesn't come to judge us or cast us to lots of good or evil. 

People self select. They choose for themselves in their own life. 

And this is the marvelous work: to be convinced of peace. 

Am I "convince" of peace as stated above? Do I recognize that the peaceful way is always the best way through?

No, it says "convincing of them *unto* peace", meaning that convincing them of Jesus, which leads to peace. But the sentiment is the same: that living a life of peace is the one I want.

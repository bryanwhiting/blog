# Scriptures

The Lord's atonement is infinite. 

> Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonementâ€”save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.
> [2 Nephi 9.7](../scriptures/2-nephi-9.7)

# Meaning

When considering building a building, we may choose to have a super strong foundation or a mediocre foundation. My house has a mediocre one compared to the foundation of a skyscraper. 

The Lord's atonement isn't temporary. It isn't 80%. It's infinite. It fulfilled all that it needed to fulfill. It left no stone unturned.

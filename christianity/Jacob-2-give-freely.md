# Meaning

Reading [Building a Story Brand](../book-review/building-a-story-brand.md), I was impressed by the author's philosophy on giving away things. His time. Resources. Knowledge. He challenged the notion that in business you should charge for everything. Instead he sought to give away as much as he could. His business has grown pretty well. 

There's also the principle of reciprocity, well studied in [Influence The Psychology of Persuasion](../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.md). When we give, people feel a social debt and want to repay it even more than what was given. 

Both of these things are taught by the Savior's desire for us to give freely, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." ([Acts 20.35](../scriptures/acts-20.35))

Consider the design: instill in people a desire to repay debts. When one person gives, other people give more back. Then the first person wants to give because a surplus was given to them. And then and then and then. More giving. 

I reviewed this in [I'm Grateful for Marriage](../gratitude/marriage.md), the parable of the no-elbow people. Better to give.

A lot of us have very little control over the world we're born into. We can do a lot for our own lives, but very few of us will have the ability to change nations. 

Which is why I love this scripture:

> And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and **whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be.**
> [1 Nephi 13.37](../scriptures/1-nephi-13.37)

Regardless of your status, if you publish peace, good awaits you.

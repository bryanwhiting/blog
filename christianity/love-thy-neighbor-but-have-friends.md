Christ invited us to love our neighbors:

>  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord.
> [Leviticus 19.18](../scriptures/leviticus-19.18)

But He himself had his friends: his disciples. He didn't try hanging out with the Pharisees or the Romans. He spent time at dinner with his apostles and followers. 

He had four brothers. Did he call them to apostleship? No. Did he *not* love them? No, he loved them. 

He loved the Roman as much as he loved John the Beloved: enough to die for them and prepare the way for them to rejoin him in heaven. 

But he also spent time with those he loved. What does this teach us about love?

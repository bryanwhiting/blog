# Scriptures

This chapter doesn't lay about all the purposes of the Book of Mormon, but it lays out some. 

Purpose: help people eat and be filled. The souls who aren't fed are like hungry men who dream of eating but awake empty. 

> And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
> [2 Nephi 27.3](../scriptures/2-nephi-27.3)

The book is a revelation. It's a miracle in itself. It's a witness of all things, and a testament of its translator. 

> And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.
> [2 Nephi 27.7](../scriptures/2-nephi-27.7)

It will be a revelation of the doctrines that have been taught since the foundation of the world and will be taught until the end of it:[^1]

> And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.
> [2 Nephi 27.11](../scriptures/2-nephi-27.11)



Evidence that this is the Lord's work, because he turned a plow boy into a translator of a sealed book:

> Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee.
> [2 Nephi 27.20](../scriptures/2-nephi-27.20)

The Lord will do a marvelous work through this book. It'll be the means of converting people to Him and His gospel:

> Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid.
> [2 Nephi 27.26](../scriptures/2-nephi-27.26)

# Meaning

This teaches me that the Lord is doing His work. That I have a role in this work. 


[^1]: it's incredible how when you read this you want to know what those hidden mysteries are. When in reality it's the simple things that have always been taught: the gospel of faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost.

# Scriptures

> Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I cast thee off forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is the bill of your motherâ€™s divorcement? To whom have I put thee away, or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
> [2 Nephi 7.1](../scriptures/2-nephi-7.1)

# Meaning

We often think God has abandoned us. But this ancient reminder lays out that the Lord cannot leave us. He's bound by the covenant even if we abandon it. 

That it's only our separating ourselves from God and not repenting to reconcile the gap that were separated from Him.

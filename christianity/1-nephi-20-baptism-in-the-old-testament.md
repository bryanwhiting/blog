# Scriptures

The Isaiah chapters in Nephi often get skipped. But if you skip them, we miss out on important doctrine, like how "baptism" appears in the Nephi version of Isaiah 48 but not in the King James Version. 

> Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or **out of the waters of baptism**, who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in truth nor in righteousness.
> [1 Nephi 20.1](../scriptures/1-nephi-20.1)

But if you compare to Isaiah 48, that line is not mentioned: 

> Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.
> [Isaiah 48.1](../scriptures/isaiah-48.1)

The only reference to baptism in the Old Testament is found only in the chapter heading of 1 Kings 7:

> The molten sea (baptismal font) rests on the backs of twelve oxen.
> [1 Kings 7](../scriptures/1-kings-7)

This is clearly one of the "plain and precious" things taken, or lost in translation, from the Bible:

> they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and **also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away**.
> [1 Nephi 13.26](../scriptures/1-nephi-13.26)

But we know they practiced baptism in the Old Testament because Nephi lived and taught it, and the Pearl of Great Price talks about Adam's baptism and ordination into the priesthood:

> And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water.  65 And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man.  66 And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever;  67 And thou art after the order of him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity.  68 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons. Amen.
> [Moses 6.64–68](../scriptures/moses-6.64-68)

# Meaning

- It was cool to notice this today, as that verse popped out to me and that word "baptism". It makes me wonder what else was taken from these Isaiah chapters
- It makes sense to me how valuable the Book of Mormon is to answer these longstanding questions. 
- Those who are of the house of Israel are those who are baptized. The baptized are adopted into the Abrahamic family. This is is consistent with Galatians 3:

> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.  29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
> [Galatians 3.27–29](../scriptures/galatians-3.27-29)

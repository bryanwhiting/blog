Just cleaned up the Christmas tree and all its ornaments and needles. The glittering, shimmering sparkles and lights that have warmed us for the last month are officially gone. Packed up. Shipped out. Sent home. 


My child remarked, "it feels so empty without the tree!" I couldn't help but agree.

The thought dawned on me, perhaps this is what the disciples felt once His light left the earth. Some accounts declare there was thundering and lightning and three days of darkness after He gave his life. 

But just as his easily preventable departure left friends and parents weeping (because they didn't fully understand what he was dying for), perhaps we can remember a little of that sadness that they felt as we clean up the tree. The child was born. He was hung on a tree. And now, my pine tree is dead. 

But remember what happened after? He resurrected. He brought his light back to his friends. Perhaps New Year's lights can remind us of His return. And perhaps the New Year's resolution can remind us that He invited His disciples to change their ways and go and preach to the gentiles, to share the gift of Christmas with everyone.

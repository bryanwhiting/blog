# Scriptures

2 Nephi 4 has two interesting scriptures:

> And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.

> He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.

Can you imagine a human who has felt so much love to describe it as the consuming of his flesh, yet have perhaps a degree of self loathing because of his sins? That he'd like to be happy but he can't because he knows what he's done wrong?

I think anyone who is a human can empathize.

# Meaning

Humanity is about building a relationship with God. God is about letting us have agency. He doesn't expect us to be perfect. He expects us to be human, but guides us to perfection. In some sense He demands it, knowing we'll fall short. 

But we can take comfort in that He will bless us even when we feel undeserving.

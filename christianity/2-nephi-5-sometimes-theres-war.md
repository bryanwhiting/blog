# Scriptures
[2 Nephi 5 - Emergency Preparedness](../2-nephi-5-emergency-preparedness.md) talks about how Nephi was prepared to leave his family. He made swords. 

Sadly, we learn that Laman and Lemuel and their people did content with Nephi and his people, even to "wars":

> And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had passed away, and we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.
> [2 Nephi 5.34](../scriptures/2-nephi-5.34)

# Meaning

War rages in the hearts of individuals. This verse brings sadness because there's an aspect of not being able to change people (a good thing) and instead realizing that sometimes in life things might not change. So it's time to move on.

It's the first Sunday of the month, and it's tradition in the church to publicly bear one's witness of Christ should they feel inclined. I'll do that here today...

I just watched the movie Dune, part 2 last night. Having been slightly captivated by the story, I first watched the Dune Part 1 movie in November and then proceeded to read [Dune](../book-review/dune.md) and [Dune: Messiah](../book-review/dune-messiah.md). [Frank Herbert](../concepts/frank-herbert.md)'s main ethos in all the interviews he does is to show the horrors that arise when man puts his faith in *heroes*. He cites Hitler, Roosevelt, Kennedy, and others that seem mythic from human comparison but they're only mythic because we made them so. 

Frequently, Paul says things like "these are my followers, but they used to be my friends." In one moment he asks himself "have I lost you too, Gurney", who is his right hand man. 

Separately, I finished reading [The Inklings](../book-review/the-inklings.md), which explains Tolkien and CS Lewis's relationship, and how one of the turning points for Lewis in his atheist-to-Christian conversion was the argument over myth. Lewis chides Christ as just a myth - something people wanted him to be. A story as old as time. 

Tolkien's viewpoint is of the effect "and why is that a problem?" He posits along the lines myth is to creation as mathematical theory is to discovering theorems and proofs. While Lewis calls Christ a Pagan myth, Tolkien responds as follows:

> Now the story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God’s myth where the others are men’s myths: i.e. the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call ‘real things’.
> [J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and the Idea of the “True Myth” | Russell's Inspiration Daybook](https://inspirationdaybook.wordpress.com/2018/06/11/j-r-r-tolkien-c-s-lewis-and-the-idea-of-the-true-myth/) 


What's the relationship here? 

I've often heard Lewis' argument in my life - why believe in Christ - it's just a story that's been told throughout the centuries. Dune is one latest example of this, but for millenia there's been a prophecy of some savior of sorts. It's all just hogwash. 

In Dune, there's a prophesied messiah of the people. But he's not deity - he's the product of selective breeding, excellent combat training, and psychoactive enhancement through drugs. Just a story. Invented by an author. But reflects so many similarities of religious archetypes we hear. 

# Stories that Lead to Christ

Assume I have an eternal truth to teach you: 1+1=2. 

But assume I didn't have numbers to teach you this truth. All I had was leaves from the backyard. 

And instead of the concepts of "one" and "two" I have the concepts of "oof" and "doof", but it's the same thing. 

Get it?

The same story said in other languages is still the same story. 

But what if that story is "999+345=1344". Or the story is "999+344=1345" or "998+346=1344".

Same concept: two numbers added together to equal a third. 

Which is "true"? They're all three just stories. But only one of them is properly constructed. Only one of them represents valid truth. The other two aren't added right, so the story of "+" and "=" doesn't add up. 

# The Story of Christ

There are many moments in Dune that approximate the story of Christ. But there are crucial components that don't add up. 

For example, Paul Atreides is the prophesied messiah of the Fremen, come to liberate their people. And he does this by war. 

Similarly, the Jews thought their Messiah would liberate them from captivity. They assumed physical captivity. Instead, He liberated them from spiritual captivity. 

Similar story, but very different. Because Christ actually happened. He actually came. He actually liberated according to prophesy. 

He's not just another spiritual leader, in the ranks of Buddha, Muhammad, Ghandi, or Zeus. 

He *was* and *is* the chosen Messiah. Chosen by Heavenly Father. Chosen to lead. Chosen to redeem. To save. To suffer. To die. To rise. To return. 

At some point, a friend once said "the universe opens doors when you ask for it". I responded "yea, there's a scripture 'ask and ye shall receive'". He responded "that's great we both come to the same truth but with different belief systems". For example, things like the Golden rule appeared centuries before Christ?[^1]

I agreed about his conclusion, but disagreed with the journey. Because truth cannot be relative. It would cease to operate as truth. 

Instead, what we I believe we see is that the Light of Christ shines through all people, and that God loves His children to share His truth through all nations, by causing great people to rise and lead their nations. But He is doing a great work, one where He teaches truth through many sources, with the goal that when they hear His complete truth they'll comprehend His message and then make covenants with Him to prepare to return to live with him. 

But also consider the stories that Alma taught his people. He perhaps didn't teach them about the kingdoms of glory, like we now know. The truth of Christ is being restored. The story is still unfolding. We still live with incomplete stories. And that's okay. 

The essential is always there: the covenants and the gospel. Abraham lived the covenants of baptism and the priesthood, though the laws and commandments were different. 

I'm grateful for a Lord who teaches us all. I'm grateful for His truth taught in stories all around the world in different forms. It's not evidence of some irrelevant myth. It's the myth of the truth His incredible redemption.

1. Don't ask them about their families. Ask them how they're doing. Minister to them. 
2. Get to know them
	1. This teaches them you care. And it teaches them how to minister. 
	2. A byproduct is you'll eventually talk about your families too. But that can wait till the next interview. 
	3. We got rid of "home visits" but now have an excuse every month to be ministered to by a priesthood leader. 
3. Include the youth. 
4. Follow up. 
5. In person. Texting is useless. Get to know them.

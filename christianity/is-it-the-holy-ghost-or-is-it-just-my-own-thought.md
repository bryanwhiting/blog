This is a frequent question any who has the [Gift of the Holy Ghost](../scriptures/gift-of-the-holy-ghost.md) wonders. 

In my opinion, what matters is that we're doing good work. 

# Scriptures

Jesus went about doing good. Yet his hem was touched and he turned around. 


Anxiously engaged in a good cause. If it's good it's good. If your thought or the Lord's thought then what does it matter? He will guide your thoughts by what you read. By what you do. 

[The Happiest Man on Earth](../book-review/the-happiest-man-on-earth.md) talks about the value of living a good life and doing good work.

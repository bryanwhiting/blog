The Book of Mormon had 12 witnesses of its divinity - the three spiritual testimonies by the Three Witnesses, the eight witnesses with a physical witness, and Joseph Smith, the one who translated it as prophet, seer, and revelator. Powerfully, all Three Witnesses left the church years later (1937/38) nearly 8-9 years after writing their testimony (1829), but never left their testimonies:

> Despite differences with Joseph Smith that led each of the Three Witnesses to part ways individually with the Church (Cowdery and Harris later returned), they continued to affirm their testimony as witnesses throughout their lives.

# When a loved one leaves their testimony

Let's consider the world where these three denied their testimonies. (It's easy to see that they 'never doubted their own witness, therefore it must be true'.) But I think this is a sandy foundation because a thing should be true regardless of what three individuals say about it.

Those who believe in Christ hold strong beliefs in Him, and it must be a belief because they cannot see Him. They rely on the faith and testimony of others. What do you do when a loved one abandons their testimony, or becomes an [unbeliever](../book-review/unbelievable.md). Do you doubt everything you learned from them? Perhaps.

Who do you trust - the "them" now that un-believes, or the "them" *then* that once believed?

Consider a hard-and-fast alternative: what if someone began doubting the existence of gravity? What if they were once your Physics professor? Easy: you just go to the apple tree and demonstrate the principle. "No, that's magnetism", the professor now believes. Okay, then I've gotta prove magnetism has to do with metals, etc. But let's assume you don't know much about magnetism or metals.

You're kind of stuck: well, if you think it's magnetism, there's not much I can do - this concept is called gravity. Similarly, people leave God's path and believe the Hand of God that acts in their live is now, and always has been, just coincidence, luck, etc.

# Putting a name on a Concept

There's precedence for this - When Ammon appeared to the Lamanites, they thought he acted by the Great Spirit. Instead of telling them they were wrong, he instead clarified, "that great spirit *is* God".

Likewise, when unbelievers doubt the Hand of God, or re-cast their old ways according to a *new* belief framework, they're just labeling a concept in a different way.

After all, when people leave God they claim [confirmation bias](https://robjhyndman.com/unbelievable/ch4.html), that you favor the evidence that supports your belief. Hyndman argues can go both ways, for believers and unbelievers, but *does* claim that evidence favors the skeptics because there should be evidence. I'd argue he relies solely on *physical* evidence. There is _spiritual_ evidence to be considered. *Spiritual* evidence is what we believe in. It's what the Three Witnesses relied on. It's unprovable to anyone else, and only receivable by the Holy Ghost. If God exists, let Him reveal himself. Let Him prevail:

The most powerful thing about being a Christian is that *it cannot be proven* Christ *didn't* exist or walk the earth. Even if you falsify the entire bible, erase history, or discover that "Mary" was an invented concept by some creed or counsel bound to oppress us - there's still a question: did the Man exist? We can debate it. Pharisees debated if He was That Messiah. Nobody now can know, except God reveals it to them.

Why? Because to claim God doesn't exist, or the plates weren't real, you'd also have to have evidence. Counter-evidence *isn't* evidence. Lack of evidence likewise. Don't we continually find new fossils? New animals in the wild? Lack of evidence doesn't mean they don't exist. So to prove God doesn't exist people just say "well I found all this stuff about the bible, about church leaders, etc" was wrong or misconstrued. So? First, we have to make sure the "new stuff" learned is actually true (could be a lie), and if it is true, we find out how this fits into Christ's bigger picture.

You can't claim that Joseph Smith *didn't* see God and that the *Three Witnesses* *didn't* see the plates at some point. Because you weren't there. Even if they *had* later denied, from reading [Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI](../book-review/killers-of-the-flower-moon.md), it's quite clear how people can be manipulated in the courts of law, influenced by money, influenced by their own delusions. Relying on people isn't how we learn the existence of a Divine. Peter learned this the way we all must (quote above).
# Flip Floppers on Both Sides

Floppers flip both ways. You've got the Pauls who were once Christian persecutors who flip to believers, and you've got those who claimed Joseph Smith was a fallen prophet. You've got the "apostates", or your "unbeliever" friends. It's fun to say "oh, but that guy lied because XYZ reason", but that's a sandy foundation.

We're all more like Laman and Lemuel than we realize. We see things that make us believe and we repent, then we forget and claim they never happened.

We're all flip floppers. Let us not seek truth from others, or even rely solely on the Prophet. Our testimonies must be on Christ, and learning truth by the Holy Ghost, who will then guide us to understand the words of prophets and imperfect leaders.

TODO: coming day - rely on constant influence of holy ghost.

I'm glad the Three Witnesses never denied their testimonies, but I'm glad there's a way to know the Book of Mormon is true without them. After all, those dudes didn't answer my prayer about the book's truth. God did.

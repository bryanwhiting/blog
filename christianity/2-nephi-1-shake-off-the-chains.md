# Scriptures

Keeping the commandments brings blessings:

> And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence.
> [2 Nephi 1.20](../scriptures/2-nephi-1.20)

Think about it. Keeping the commandments means being honest, being kind, being respectful, finding a way to help others. Not being lazy. Being productive. 

Literally, nobody can prosper without keeping some commandment. Without finding a way to meet someone's need. 

I also like this verse:

> Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust.
> [2 Nephi 1.23](../scriptures/2-nephi-1.23)

It's a rallying cry we can all relate to. We are all bound with chains in life. But we don't have to be. The call to "rise up" is a call to shake the chains to hold you bound. Arise from the dust!

# Meaning

It makes me wonder: what are the chains that hold me bound? Perhaps there are limiting beliefs.

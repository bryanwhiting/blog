# Scriptures

> For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass.
> [2 Nephi 4.2](../scriptures/2-nephi-4.2)

This is another powerful reminder of things lost from the Bible, similar to [1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament](1-nephi-20-baptism-in-the-old-testament.md). As we look at 2 Nephi 3:5, we see a link to the Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis. 

> 24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die, and go unto my fathers; and I go down to my grave with joy. The God of my father Jacob be with you, to deliver you out of affliction in the days of your bondage; for the Lord hath visited me, and I have obtained a promise of the Lord, **that out of the fruit of my loins, the Lord God will raise up a righteous branch out of my loins**; and unto thee, whom my father Jacob hath named Israel, a prophet; (not the Messiah who is called Shilo;) and this prophet shall deliver my people out of Egypt in the days of thy bondage.
> [JST, Genesis 50.24](../scriptures/jst,-genesis-50.24)

Imagine if for 2000 years the entire world knew about this prophecy and the other things in 50:24-38

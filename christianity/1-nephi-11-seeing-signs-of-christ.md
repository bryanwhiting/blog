Nephi saw a vision because he desired knowledge. Consider the Angel's instruction:

> 7 And behold this thing **shall be given unto thee for a sign**, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.
> [1 Nephi 11.7](../scriptures/1-nephi-11.7)

Now, we know that the Lord rebuked the Pharisees for seeking signs:

> The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.  And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but **can ye not discern the signs of the times?**  A **wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign**; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
> [Matthew 16.1â€“4](../scriptures/matthew-16.1-4)

But signs themselves are good. Moses lead by signs: the seven miracles. Baal was trumped by a sign: fire from heaven. Manna in the wilderness. Water from the rock. The fall of the city from trumpets. Oil in the vial. 

Any miracle is a sign. A sign that God exists. That He has all power. That Christ is His son. 

But today we don't need to seek for *new* signs but instead do as the Lord said and "discern the signs of the times".

By seeking to see His hand, we find the signs. 

It's wicked to seek for a sign, because wicked means "unrepentant". An unrepentant soul, one who is not going to Heavenly Father and seeking His love, doesn't see the Hand of God in their life. As a result, they are without his signs ([Gratus sum, ergo habeo](../concepts/gratus-sum-ergo-habeo.md)).

So to see signs:

1. Repent (desire a connection with Heavenly Father and His son)
2. Look for them (discern)

Presto poof.

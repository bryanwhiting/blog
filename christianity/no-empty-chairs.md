I recently heard the 1998 song, "[No Empty Chairs](http://bearlakemonsters.blogspot.com/2010/09/no-empty-chairs.html)", written by the late Senator Orrin Hatch. I had never before heard the song, and it unsettled me.

It talks about this theme long discussed in the church: "no empty chairs." It speaks to our view of eternity and how families can be together forever. It speaks to the desire of family members to all be seated together, not perhaps at a literal table, but just that everyone is together in heaven. What's wrong with that?

The theme and song itself at face value are admirable for anyone who loves their family. It's no different than the soldier's motto "leave no man behind". All are worth it. Save everyone. Leave nobody behind. 

So on one side, you've got the "no empty chairs" people, hoping to leave nobody behind. But on the other side, the phrase could be interpreted differently. 

While reading [Unbelievable](../book-review/unbelievable.md), the autobiography if a man leaving Christianity, I saw how the principles discussed here are more about the relationship between believers and non-believers. I believe it's a pattern found and applied, though I speak specifically to experience of people leaving the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and how this phrase may affect them. 

# The origin of "no empty chairs"

I tried briefly tracking down the origin of this phrase. It was mentioned once in general conference by [Elder Benson in 1984](https://www.lds-general-conference.org/), "...that all will be worthy, without a single empty chair. That is my fervent hope and prayer for each family in the Church..."

In a [1986 article by David B Haight](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#:t109b&%22empty%20chairs%22:st&&1830&2023&gjt&n&30@0$%22empty%20chairs%22), he also paraphrased President Benson's family motto:

> President Benson loves his family and keeps in constant touch with them—his six children (all faithful in the Church), thirty-four grandchildren, and twenty great-grandchildren. He and Sister Benson have a motto in their family, that in this life and the next there will be “no empty chairs.” Can you think of a more heavenly goal?

Church news posted about the theme in [1990](https://www.thechurchnews.com/1990/7/28/23261560/no-empty-chairs), again referring to President Benson. 

But I believe Lucy Mack Smith, an LDS pioneer and father of Joseph Smith, wins the award. She had the phrase "please - no empty chairs" [written on a memorial to her. ](https://latterdaysoprano.com/2008/03/08/no-empty-chairs/)

I'm sure someone somewhere knows the true origin, but that's about all I got out of 10 minutes of googling. (This [author](https://www.ldsliving.com/6-tips-for-parents-of-adult-children-who-dont-believe-in-the-church/s/90940) reached the same conclusion.)
# The impact of concept

For some, this concept can be inspiring. One person recounted how the idea [helped lift them out of drug addiction](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2013/03/no-empty-chairs?lang=eng). This is perhaps the ideal scenario for a believer: to say something that can help a non-believer come back. 

But times are changing and religious dynamics are shifting. Per [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america/pf_2022-09-13_religious-projections_01-01/), 90% of Americans identified as Christian in 1972 and as of 2020 that number dropped to 64%. [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america/) also estimates various scenarios where this number drops to 35% in next 50 years. The Public Religion Research Institute estimates that church-goers in America dropped from [56% to 43% between 2013 and 2022](https://www.prri.org/research/religion-and-congregations-in-a-time-of-social-and-political-upheaval/). All signs point to people leaving Christianity fairly rapidly. Give it 20 years where the geriatric religious are replaced by Gen Z/Millenial non religious and this exacerbates quickly. 

I don't know any close friend who *doesn't* have several family members no longer in the Church. Families are split in terms of people who are religious vs not. Parents who stay in the [church struggle](https://www.ldsliving.com/6-tips-for-parents-of-adult-children-who-dont-believe-in-the-church/s/90940) knowing how to keep relationships with children who have left. They feel like failures they don't have 6 children all "active" like President Benson. But this has never been the norm, as Joseph Smith's son defected from the church, Lehi's sons and daughters didn't stay with it, and I'm sure many countless other leaders who don't have "full participation in the church". 

# Effect on those who leave

But I think for most people who leave the church, they struggle with this concept on the other side. They want to know how to identify themselves to those who are still in the church. They want relationships with their family members and don't know how to do that since so much of their life has been in the church. 

I was talking to my friend the other day at church and he felt like he had to identify, "I don't really come that often, so I guess I'm like less active or something?" People like identities, and they try to categorize themselves.[^1]

This language misaligns their focus. 

# The focus should be on a relationship with the Savior

[How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices](../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.md) lays out how "resulting" is the process of evaluating the quality of a decision based on how it turned out. Instead you should focus on how you went about making the decision because outcomes can always be uncertain. 

"No empty chairs" focuses on the outcome, and not the process. 

Focusing on "no empty chairs" isn't the doctrine. It's an invitation and wish, but even for Heavenly Father 1/3 of hosts of heaven didn't come to earth. Lots of empty chairs. Agency is the doctrine. 

Whether you're in the chair or not, whether less active or active, etc. is just the wrong mindset. The mindset that matters is: do I have a relationship with the Savior? Am I coming to know Him?

"No empty chairs" takes the focus off the Savior and instead perhaps puts it on a social construct or pact "we're all in this together and you'd better be there. No empty chairs." It's probably not meant that way, but it can be chosen to be interpreted that way. The focus is on group think and black and white labels. "Am I the black sheep? The empty chair?" That's yes/no thinking.

Instead, the framework could be "help teach and invite everyone to enjoy a meaningful relationship with the Savior, so they can have greater peace and joy". If that's the mentality, then as people come to the Savior (truth, light), then they will have a reason to sit down. 


Notes:
- someone close to me asked "where do you think I'm going?"  I wonder "if you don't believe in God then why does it matter what I think?" But that wasn't what he was asking. They were asking "do you accept and love me even though I don't believe what you do?"
- imagine going across the street to your neighbor or to a random stranger in the street. "No empty chairs!!!" They'd think you weird. So why do we do this in our family?
- It's a matter of social acceptance with you. How do you see them? Love them? Do they feel your love to them is conditioned on their status in religion? 
- The intention is American: leave no man behind. Nothing wrong with that. But someone just doesn't want to be seen as a "lost" soul when they don't feel lost, and in some sense see you or their former ways in your religion as lost. 

[^1]: an author Rob Hyndman [talked about his departure from Christianity](https://robjhyndman.com/unbelievable/ch2.html) as "So what should I call myself now I am not a Christadelphian, or even a Christian? I don’t like the term atheist, because it carries a sense of militancy and certainty that I don’t feel. I don’t like agnostic, because it implies (in Australia at least) a lack of interest in the questions of religion. I think I prefer “unbeliever”."

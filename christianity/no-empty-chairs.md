With those who have a view of eternity, they may consider the desire to have "no empty chairs" in the world to come. This simply implies that they want to see everyone in heaven. 

# The origin of the phrase

I recently heard the 1998 classic, "[No Empty Chairs](http://bearlakemonsters.blogspot.com/2010/09/no-empty-chairs.html)", written by the late Senator Orrin Hatch. It talks about this theme clearly. 

I tried briefly tracking down the origin of this phrase. It was mentioned once in general conference by [Elder Benson in 1984](https://www.lds-general-conference.org/), "...that all will be worthy, without a single empty chair. That is my fervent hope and prayer for each family in the Church..."

In a [1986 article by David B Haight](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#:t109b&%22empty%20chairs%22:st&&1830&2023&gjt&n&30@0$%22empty%20chairs%22), he also paraphrased President Benson's family motto:

> President Benson loves his family and keeps in constant touch with them—his six children (all faithful in the Church), thirty-four grandchildren, and twenty great-grandchildren. He and Sister Benson have a motto in their family, that in this life and the next there will be “no empty chairs.” Can you think of a more heavenly goal?

Church news posted about the theme in [1990](https://www.thechurchnews.com/1990/7/28/23261560/no-empty-chairs), again referring to President Benson. 

But I believe Lucy Mack Smith, an LDS pioneer and father of Joseph Smith, wins the award. She had the phrase "please - no empty chairs" [written on a memorial to her. ](https://latterdaysoprano.com/2008/03/08/no-empty-chairs/)

# The impact of concept

For some, this concept can be inspiring. One person recounted how the idea [helped lift them out of drug addiction](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2013/03/no-empty-chairs?lang=eng). 

But times have changed. I don't know any close friend who doesn't have several family members no longer in the church. Families are split in terms of people who are religious vs not. Parents who stay in the [church struggle](https://www.ldsliving.com/6-tips-for-parents-of-adult-children-who-dont-believe-in-the-church/s/90940) knowing how to keep relationships with children who have left. They feel bad they don't have 34 grandchildren all "active" like President Benson. 

But I think for most people who leave the church, they struggle with this concept on the other side. They want to know how to identify themselves to those who are still in the church. They want relationships with their family members and don't know how to do that since so much of their life has been in the church. 

I was talking to my friend the other day at church and he felt like he had to identify, "I don't really come that often, so I guess I'm like less active or something?" People like identities, and they try to categorize themselves. 

This language misaligns their focus. 

# The focus should be on a relationship with the Savior

[How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices](../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.md) lays out how "resulting" is the process of evaluating the quality of a decision based on how it turned out. Instead you should focus on how you went about making the decision because outcomes can always be uncertain. 

"No empty chairs" focuses on the outcome, and not the process. 

Focusing on "no empty chairs" isn't the doctrine. It's actually anti-doctrine. 1/3 of hosts of heaven didn't come to earth. Lots of empty chairs. Agency is the doctrine. 

Whether you're in the chair or not, whether less active or active, etc is just the wrong mindset. The only mindset that matters is: do I have a relationship with the Savior? Am I coming to know Him?

"No empty chairs" takes the focus off the Savior and instead perhaps puts it on a social construct or pact "we're all in this together and you'd better be there. No empty chairs." It's probably not meant that way, but it can be chosen to be interpreted that way. 

Instead, the framework could be "help teach and invite everyone to enjoy a meaningful relationship with the Savior, so they can have greater peace and joy". If that's the mentality, then as people come to the Savior (truth, light), then they will have a reason to sit down.

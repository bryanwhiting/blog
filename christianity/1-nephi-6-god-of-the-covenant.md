Nephi introduces the concept of the "God of Abraham" in the Book of Mormon:

> For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and be saved.
> [1 Nephi 6.4](../scriptures/1-nephi-6.4)

Why? Well, repetition helps us remember. Calling out multiple names also tells us that there were several generations of believers. Also, many people are descendants of these folks so using their name invokes their ancestry. These are three reasons why Nephi (and others) may use this triple threat to identify the God we can worship. 

But I think there's one more reason: the God of the Old Testament is Jesus. He's the god is the covenant. The covenant of Abraham in which all seeds of the earth shall be blessed. God of Isaac and Jacob - who also received more covenants. 

When we worship a God of covenants, we become empowered by those covenants.

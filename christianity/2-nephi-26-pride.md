# Scriptures

> And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.
> [2 Nephi 26.20](../scriptures/2-nephi-26.20)

# Meaning

I think I've always assumed that Nephi saw the restoration and then saw the second coming. And that's it. That's kind of how it reads. 

But as I ponder this I wonder how much he saw. Did he see 2024? Did he see what my people would be going through? Probably. Perhaps. 

Assuming he did, and that this was written about today, what are the churches that have risen up to get gain? Probably people with pride in their heart.

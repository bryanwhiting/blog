"Gratus sum, [ergo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum) habeo." (I'm thankful, therefore I have.)

In November 2020, a Christian apostle named Russell Nelson invited the world to [flood social media with gratitude](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude?lang=eng). I rather enjoyed posting gratitude publicly, so here we go.

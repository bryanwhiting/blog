workout-notes: About 20 pushups, assisted on knees second time. 20-25 on lower back and squat. 10ish on abs.
workout-vibe: I was feeling really really sluggish like I didn't want to do it. Then by the very last set of the last round I felt like the workout woke me up. Probably the first time I workout where I feel like I wasn't feeling well and workout out and the last exercise got me energized and out of a funk. Only took 10 minutes. It reset my day.

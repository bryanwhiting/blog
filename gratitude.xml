  <title>I’m Grateful for Basketball</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just played some ball tonight. Not sure who invented this game, but it’s really come a long way.</p>
<p>The cool thing is that you can be horrible at shooting and still find a way to contribute. There are a lot of skills and abilities that make a good team.</p>
<p>I play with the same 20 guys, and it’s amazing how different combinations of 5 people play so differently. The flow, the passing, the defense - it all varies with who’ve you got on the court. And that’s what makes it fun. Sometimes you contribute more. Sometimes less.</p>

<p>I’ve played it my whole life, though never well. I played in rec leagues in college. In rec leagues in high school. And now with a bunch of folks who just love the game. And that’s why it’s fun: it brings people together.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rescue Workers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rescue-workers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just read a book about the true “heroes” of this world with my kids. It illustrated the many perils that members of the coast guard, police department, fire department, and health care workers and such face.</p>
<p>I think about the souls who lost their lives trying to save victims of 9/11. I think about someone close to me who was flown on a helicopter to another hospital and saved there. I think about a friend in high school who was carted away in an ambulance because they collapsed right on the ground during the middle of a game.</p>
<p>We have an amazing response team in America. The fact that anyone can pick up their phone and dial 3 numbers and get help within 5 minutes from people trained to help is pretty incredible. It’s a safety net we don’t appreciate until we need it. And many in the world live without it.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Imagination</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/imagination.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was with my kids at the park as we go from tree to tree. One is my house. One is her house. One is his house. We’re playing neighbors, having ice cream, and cooking s’mores on a fire. None of these things exist.</p>
<p>It dawned on me for a moment: I wish I could see what they see. Where did it go - my constant imagination? It’s in there somewhere, the place where there’s no difference between dream and reality. The joy they feel at make believe Disneyland (the playground) and real Disneyland is in many degrees the same.</p>
<p>This is all because of their imagination. I’m grateful to have kids show me the many uses for a boring twig: a wand; a walking stick; a s’mores roaster; a knob to open a secret gate to the house; a portal to another world…</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Chirping Birds</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/chirping-birds.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Been hearing some birds chirp lately. It’s still January but around where I live it’s practically spring.</p>
<p>On early morning hikes I can sometimes hear the birds waking up. Sometimes a tree will be full of the little chirpers.</p>
<p>Why do birds sing? Why do they like singing more in the late winter, or after a rain storm? It’s a calming reassurance that we’ve all been hunkered down during a storm and are relieved to see the sun.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the beady eyes, the quick twitch of the head and neck, the instinctual liftoff when you get too close…maybe that’s why I like them. They’re just cool. Birds are cool.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rock Climbing</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rock-climbing.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I participated in Boy Scouts growing up, and I got to go to High Adventure. This was a week where we’d go on an adventurous camping trip with a bunch of other teenagers. Things never went according to plan.</p>
<p>On one experience, I was repelling over a hang. After 30 feet repelling, I was then dangling over nothing. There was a double belay, one above and one below. This meant that either could help save me.</p>
<p>I was invited to let go of my first belay. Yes. Let go.</p>
<p>This meant I’d drop 150-200 feet in a free fall. The bottom belay would catch me.</p>
<p>I held the rope tightly in my hand as I looked off into the Appalachian mountains and the green trees dotting my surroundings. I looked ahead at the rock face, and up at the cliff hang. I held that rope for a second more before…drop.</p>
<p>And I fell, as planned! It was insane and it took all of half a second.</p>
<p>But then something unexpected happened: the first belay rope wrapped around my right leg. I turned upside down and instead of the belay stopping me, the burning of rope wrapped around my leg halted my descent. Didn’t feel good.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I didn’t die that day. That rope could have wrapped my neck. It’s possible I could have not stopped for some reason. It’s possible those guys who were my guides that day didn’t actually know what they were doing and it wasn’t as safe as they said.</p>
<p>That feeling of dropping was incredible though, as you never feel so heavy as when your hurtling towards the ground at gravitational constant acceleration.</p>
<p>I had many great experiences since then rock climbing, though I don’t go often. It’s just a cool thing to do. It’s cool people figured out how to do it and how to do it safely. I’m also grateful for high adventure - I learned a lot from those formative experiences.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New Perspectives</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-perspectives.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I was a kid, I broke my wrist. I no longer would be able to play football. It was my senior year, the year where all the magic happens. The year you prepare for. The big leagues.</p>
<p>My mom told me, “when a door closes, open a window. This if life”.</p>
<p>A new perspective is an opportunity to see something that was there all along, but because of myopia you didn’t previously see it.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">I felt like this when I dove for the football. But I didn’t look like this because I didn’t catch it. Instead I broke my wrist.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Perspective is realizing that senior year wasn’t any more special than the junior year where I had fun on JV. Perspective is realizing it’s just a game. Perspective is years later realizing that something I cared so much about at the time now has little value or importance in my life, and other things have far more importance to me.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Navajo Code Talkers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/navajo-code-talkers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>My daughter brought home a book that introduced something I had never before heard about: Navajo code talkers.</p>
<p>Since the Navajo language had never been written down, it wasn’t able to be translated by the Japanese in WWII. And so, the Navajo would encode English words and transmit their words across the radio to talk about positions and bombs and such. It helped them win the war.</p>
<p>They chose to serve a country they were being heavily persecuted in (<a href="../book-review/killers-of-the-flower-moon.html">Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI</a>). It’s incredible to think about.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for them and all like them that helped provide the freedoms I enjoy.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Early Morning Workouts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/early-morning-workouts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I played football when in middle and high school. Part of the high school routine was early morning summer workouts.</p>
<p>6:30 am is brutal for a 16 year old kid. But getting up, going to the school to run some sprints, get a lift in, and get home by 8 to shower and go back to sleep was always a great feeling.</p>
<p>I’m grateful that to this day I still value exercise. I know the benefits it gives me. I also know how to lift properly so I don’t hurt myself. I also have muscle/ligament memory where it’s easier to pick up after 6months of not exercising compared to someone starting from scratch. (Maybe that’s not a scientific thing, but I feel like it is 😂).</p>
<p>I’m slightly less grateful that my 16 year old self could bench more than I’ll ever again be able to bench, and run more than I’ll ever again have time to run, but perhaps I’m grateful I can challenge myself to surpass my teenage years.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Similarities</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/similarities.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything truly unique about any one individual? At the very least, any two people probably have eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose. They probably have brain and a heart. Probably have fingers and toes.</p>
<p>Probably have feelings. Experience love. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Resentment. Joy. Elation. Fear. Anxiety. Doubt. Faith. Fulfillment. Hope.</p>
<p>The reason why they feel these things will certainly be unique to them, but likely follow the themes of family, friends, food, shelter, fulfillment, etc.</p>
<p>I learned after being in Honduras for 6 weeks just how different I was from people across the world.</p>
<p>6 months later I learned (over time) just how deeply similar they are.</p>
<p>After 2 years I came home and deeply missed Honduras. I felt alone and lost in this American world.</p>
<p>Now I’m somewhere in between. But the point is: I’m grateful that humans can connect at a deeply human level no matter who they are or where they’re from.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Social Gatherings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/social-gatherings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week I went to a tiny venue concert. The person who invited me said, “Can you believe that just two years ago we were forbidden to gather like this?”</p>
<p>We were listening to a Honky Tonk/Rockability Banjo jammer who just absolutely slayed the whole night. The energy was off the charts. Everyone was dancing and having a great time.</p>
<p>I’m glad and grateful we can get together again.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Baby Formula</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/baby-formula.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Baby formula is a miracle. According to the internet, without it, people would either use cows milk, goats milk, etc and mix it with water and honey.</p>
<p>The fact that people can go to the store and buy food to feed their infant is a miracle. It’s one of the things that has reduced infant mortality.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Things I Don’t Understand</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/things-i-dont-understand.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I don’t know about or understand a lot of things. Here’s a random list:</p>
<ul>
<li>molecular biology</li>
<li>brain surgery</li>
<li>Shakespeare</li>
<li>Diplomacy between nations</li>
<li>Best teaching methods for four year olds</li>
<li>How the heater in my house works</li>
<li>How Apple Silicon works</li>
<li>A lot of data science stuff despite working as a data scientist for 10 years</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing with knowledge is that the more you get of it, the more questions you have about the world. It was kind of hard even making that list above because I know enough to know that I don’t know enough about it. What about all the things I know nothing about. Or scarier, what about the things I think I know something about but really don’t.</p>
<p>All these things mean there’s something to be learned on every day, every minute. The world is full. We are all multi-faceted individuals who can do a ton of different things. Perhaps often we compare ourselves to those who know most about a subject vs the value and opportunity we bring with the unique set of knowledge each of us has accumulated.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’m usually wrong. It means there’s a better way. And if things turned out okay <em>and</em> I’m wrong, that’s even better: it means I can improve!</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’m able to learn from anyone on earth, who at least has a guaranteed different life experience and set of knowledge gained. I’m also grateful that everyone else is as imperfect as me, which means I can challenge them to figure out how they came to their knowledge and whether their knowledge is actually that or just a belief/opinion/etc.</p>
<p>All of this is fun, gives diversity to life, lets me know that there’s hope for a better world.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Music</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/music.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Music is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I’m not much of a musician, but I do love it. The first time I learned to play the guitar I felt a new form of communication.</p>
<p>I had known the piano before that, having played it in high school. But there was something about the guitar that taught me how to speak with music.</p>
<p>You speak with random noises from your mouth, surely you can speak with emotion from a musical instrument.</p>
<p>And people do. Great musicians communicate something in a way that words alone cannot express. And sometimes the music itself evokes an identity you didn’t know existed.</p>
<p>That’s the power of music. And I think it’s really cool that humans all over the world understand this power.</p>

<p>Reminds me as well of a close friend who wrote an album when a loved one passed away. Those were some of the most beautiful lyrics and music I had ever heard. Sometimes the best music comes from nobodies, including yourself.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Open Source</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/open-source.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Open source software is incredible. I’m deeply grateful for the people who create it and share it.</p>
<p>So much of the world benefits from open source software. YouTube was built off Python. Samsung phones run on Android. Most modern websites are built off something Zuckerberg released. PyTorch and Tensorflow have ushered in the AI revolution.</p>
<p>We’d get along without open source. But we’d be using SAS or Stata, beholden to Oracle and Java everywhere and just enduring a slow pace of innovation.</p>
<p>AI is open sourced. The future is now.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Ice Skating</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ice-skating.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I went ice skating. It was great.</p>
<p>I remembered a video about this old guy that wakes up at 5am or something and goes out and waters the ice rink. He fills up a few tubs of his own hot water and just treks over to the public park to fill up the rink. He uses his own homemade zamboni and what not.</p>
<p>There are good people in this world.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Ice rink</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What’s cool about an ice rink is I don’t think about it for 364 days a year. But it’s there when I want to go. So that means enough people love it to keep it in business, and I can go only when I want to (once a year). Thats a cool thing too: collective community makes so many things possible, like downtown restaurants and museums - places that if they relied just on me they’d never last. But the community keeps them afloat (pun?).</p>
<p>I tried finding it, but this is the closest thing I could find. Just imagine this very old guy out there shlepping 55 gallon drums of water.</p>

<p>I found it!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s just become a way of life. If I don’t do the rink I don’t feel right.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Heaven</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/heaven.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m not sure what I would do if I didn’t have a concept of Heaven in my mind. It yields so very many benefits for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives me hope for when family members pass</li>
<li>Reminds me why life matters: I can only take with me my relationships.</li>
<li>Heaven is about people, not money. Reminds me what matters <em>in</em> life and what will bring me happiness.</li>
<li>Gives me purpose as I raise my family.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a sense that heaven is more like a peaceful home than a luxurious resort. Physical amenities don’t yield joy. True pleasure and enduring happiness in life come from inner peace.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-heavenly-home.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">My heavenly home would probably be more spruced up, but this is pretty peaceful.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As a concept alone, it guides you to make better decisions by living long term: death is only a door to the beyond. Even if I assume that heaven is a farce, still believing in it yields so much good for one’s life. But thankfully it’s not just some notion. It’s a real place. I’m grateful the Lord created the heavens.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend. <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-4.9">Mosiah 4.9</a></p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for My Childhood</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/my-childhood.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I won the childhood lottery. I had good parents, good siblings, good friends, and luckily made a few good choices.</p>
<p>That’s all it takes: a few good choices. I credit my parents for giving me a good home to grow up in, a good religion to teach me good principles, and a lot of support.</p>
<p>As I grow older, time reveals itself. The dust under the childhood cushion is now identified. As I raise my own children I wonder: how did they do it?</p>
<p>Which perhaps is what my children will ask me someday.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Childhood is playing</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I’m grateful I played a lot.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for parents who take up the challenge to raise the next generation. I’m grateful for siblings to live, love, and learn from. For friends who make the journey an adventure, and for a family that I can always come back to.</p>

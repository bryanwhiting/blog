  <title>I’m Grateful for Book Club</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/book-club.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Belonging to a book club means you’re old. You’re so old that book clubs are how you have fun. Not playing pickup basketball. Not going to concerts. Not going to the movies. Not going longboarding down the canyon. A book club.</p>
<p>What’s better than any old book club? One with friends that you’ve already done all that other stuff with. One that helps you stay connected. One that inspires new ideas.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the boring book club. Because it’s fun.</p>
<p>It’s also fascinating how everyone picks up different insights. <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> talks about how hostage negotiators always have one speaker and three or four other people on the call trained to listen to just one thing. It’s because the mind can only process so much information. It’s cool to see how friends pick up on all that different stuff.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Explorers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/explorers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-wager.html">The Wager</a> right now and am enthralled and saddened by the horrible circumstances people had to go through on boats back in the day.</p>
<p>Without explorers, we wouldn’t have the knowledge of the world that we have now.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the freedoms we enjoy now, as most of us don’t have to fear about body snatchers coming to take us on a ship and force us to work until we die.</p>
<p>It’s the simple things, I guess…</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Foam Mattresses</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/foam-mattresses.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Bed in a box. It’s all the rage.</p>
<p>It shows up on your porch. You lug it upstairs, cut it open, unravel it and poof: you have a bed.</p>
<p>The first time we got a foam mattress was in 2017. It changed our life.</p>
<p>Anytime I travel I always wish I was home. Nothing like a long nights sleep in a reasonably priced, highly comfortable, never sagging, bed in a box mattress.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Chicken Sliders</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/chicken-sliders.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I sit down for lunch with a friend. The seat is leather. The booth is warm. The table is glossy with that restaurant-style gloss. And the paper in front of me invites me into a world of tasteful possibilities. The most appealing one is that of the chicken biscuit slider.</p>
<p>Moments later a plate of sliders appears next to a side of truffle fries. The aioli sauce invites a potato’s partnership. The crispy crunch of the fried chicken echos within the cavern of my bite. Eyes close. Satisfaction is earned.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Gatherings for the Super Bowl</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/gatherings-for-the-super-bowl.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I remember a few fun memories of gathering with friends and family for the Super Bowl while growing up. Often there might be a contest, with random questions like “how long is the opening anthem going to be sung for: longer or shorter than 60s?” Fill out a page of such questions and the person with the most correct answers wins.</p>
<p>Football is a fun sport. I grew up playing it for nearly 12 years - from 2nd grade through senior year. There’s something about playing a sport for that long that you grow an experiential appreciation for what these guys can do.</p>
<p>I don’t follow football much, or any sport for that matter. I don’t have the patience for tracking who goes where. But I love playing it and, when the Super Bowl is on, watching it.</p>
<p>That’s the cool thing - even people who don’t care much for football enjoy watching the game.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Old Movies</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/old-movies.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)">Casablanca (film) - Wikipedia</a> last night for the first time in 10 years. The writing. The angles. The one liners. The implementation of <a href="../posts/the-iceberg-theory-theory-of-omission.html">The Iceberg Theory - Theory of Omission</a>. There are so many cool things.</p>
<p>Great writing is timeless. What connects us to stories are the people that wrote them. The people in them. The Iliad is thousands of years old or whatever. Same with the Bible. They’re both written in language that doesn’t match modern times. But they’re still beautiful because of what they represent.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Skimboarding</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/skimboarding.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Skimboarding is one of those oddly satisfying sports that isn’t exactly thrilling but just delightful enough that you can’t get enough. It’s like popcorn. Always delicious, but you want just one more.</p>
<p>The perfect setting is a beach with a long shore, so the tide comes in and slowly ripples out. This is when you can really glide.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Long Runs</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/long-runs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2020 my friend invited me to train for a marathon. Against better judgment, I accepted. I started training in Jan of 2021, prepping for a June marathon.</p>
<p>I said yes because I needed an excuse to work out and I like listening to audio content. Also, I began running a lot in college, which was good times. The best part is getting to the top of a mountain, running a mountain trail, or discovering a new route. It all seems so natural and human. Just you and the land.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-long-runs-wilderness.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">I actually did enjoy some beautiful scenery not too dissimilar to this while training.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There’s something enlivening about a long run. There’s an endorphin kick that boosts your mental state. Then while running, you keep finding ways to make the same route a little bit longer. Or make it exactly 5 miles.</p>
<p>I often would push my kids in the stroller. I’m not sure how they survived, but they did. There was a great long lath that was a perfect 5 mile there and back, with hardly any interruption.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why this memory came back to me, because I’m pretty sure I never want to train for a marathon again. It’s horrible. It takes so much time. And then I got injured so I couldn’t even compete. But deep down there’s still a longing for a long run.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New York</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-york.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Since I was a kid, going to the city was a quarterly event. Whether going to the Bronx Zoo or the Met for a class field trip or a Yankees game, the city was always an adventure. As I grew up, it’d be the place to go to shows and concerts and visit family members who lived there.</p>
<p>Then when I was 22, I spent a summer as an intern there. Living in the city taught me what it means to be in the city.</p>
<p>From a guy who’d come up to help me with something on the Subway, to the lady who gave me some of her loose change to take the cross town bus, I was humbled by how people there look after each other. It’s hard to notice when the people are tough on the surface. But deep down they care for each other.</p>
<p>I’ve been to LA, and lived near SF, and DC and nothing compares to “city”.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Kindness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/kindness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been the recipient of a lot of kindness in my life. I know anyone reading this has too. Kindness is a wonderful gift to give someone. It doesn’t cost anything to be kind.</p>
<p>Ways people have been kind to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone called me when they knew I was making a big decision to listen to me.</li>
<li>Parents who showed me how to be kind to each other.</li>
<li>A friend who complemented me.</li>
<li>My wife who goes on dates with me and hangs out with me.</li>
<li>A child who wants to give dad a hug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindness does need to be <em>received</em>, I’ve learned. Kindness can be received when things are going well, as well as when life is tricky, though kindness is probably most poignantly felt and appreciated during hard times. I think that’s a gift: to receive kindness. It’s also a gift to give. Who do you know that could use some kindness today?</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Avocados</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/avocados.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“Aguacate, verduras!” It’s a common refrain you hear on the streets of <a href="../concepts/Honduras.html">Honduras</a>.</p>
<p>I first remember being woken up by this loud bark as a vendor walked the street inviting the entire town to enjoy his “avocados, vegetables!!”</p>
<p>I don’t blame him. I, too, want people to enjoy the things I like. And if this guy was selling avocados then I wanted to be buying.</p>
<p>It’s rare that I don’t want avocados on anything. Tonight, I enjoyed them on a hot dog, a classic dish called a “completo” in Chile. Put it on a burger. Put it on a hot dog. It’s like green eggs and ham, I’d eat it on a train, with a fox in a box. Here, there, anywhere.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for bowling</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bowling.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The car is put into park in the dark parking lot of the bowling alley. Rain descends, prompting hurried feet. The building door opens and we walk inside. <em>It’s bowling time.</em></p>
<p>Friends congregate, treats are consumed, and heavyweight spheroids enjoy the frictionless motion governed by Newtonian laws. The gutters are greedier than the pins, but regardless of where the ball ends up the hurler offers up a dance to the bowling gods, a laugh of disappointment, or a thrill of surprise. This has been the states of bowling regardless of the bowler’s age, across all known ages of my life.</p>
<p>The conversations, the dancing, the music, the flashing lights, the cheap food, the magic of self-returning balls - it is its own realm of simple enjoyment. Bowling won’t sell out stadiums, it’s rather boring compared to action sports. But that doesn’t stop anyone from enjoying it, and that’s why it’s a gift to humanity.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Home Depot Saturday Morning Crafts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/home-depot-saturday-morning-crafts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Home Depot gives out little assembly kits for kids on the first Saturday of every month. A few screws. A few pieces of wood. A simple design.</p>
<p>The chatter between children increases the closer they get to the supplier: a Home Depot working handing out presents to eager children.</p>
<p>Impatience grows the closer to the bag’s opening they become. They see other kids nearly finished around them. They can’t wait.</p>
<p>And so repeat the experience every first Saturday of every new month.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Peloton</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/peloton.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I grew up with exercise equipment in my house, and like most equipment for most people, I didn’t use it. Part of the reason was it was hard to get going.</p>
<p>There’s nothing easier than hopping on an exercise bike. Having been a runner most of my life, when I first got the Peloton I realized how nice it was to get a solid workout in 20 minutes. It’s just so easy with the little kilojoule calculator there.</p>
<p>And it could be any exercise bike, really, but I’m grateful for the one I have.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Compliments</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/compliments.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for compliments. The ones I receive and the ones I can give.</p>
<p>The cheapest thing you can give someone is a compliment. Yet it may be the most valuable gift to be given.</p>
<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a> which talks about “reciprocity”. People feel someone obligated to help you when you give them something, even if it’s nominal. Isn’t a compliment a gift?</p>
<p><a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> also discusses the benefits of being kind, and putting yourself in another’s shoes. Kindness far exceeds the benefits of criticism. A compliment is a way to think about what that person may want to hear and to give them that. Not in an insincere way, but in a sincere way.</p>
<p>People act how they want to be treated. If they show up to play basketball they want to be told they’re good at basketball. If they work on a task for you, it’s because they want to be told they’re good at that task. It doesn’t hurt to be nice. To give a compliment. So give away.</p>
<p>Being human is recognizing what other people aspire for and recognize that goodness in them. So notice. Notice what they’re after. Then give. Give freely, for so did He (<a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.html">Bread given freely, like His life</a>).</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Basketball</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/basketball.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just played some ball tonight. Not sure who invented this game, but it’s really come a long way.</p>
<p>The cool thing is that you can be horrible at shooting and still find a way to contribute. There are a lot of skills and abilities that make a good team.</p>
<p>I play with the same 20 guys, and it’s amazing how different combinations of 5 people play so differently. The flow, the passing, the defense - it all varies with who’ve you got on the court. And that’s what makes it fun. Sometimes you contribute more. Sometimes less.</p>

<p>I’ve played it my whole life, though never well. I played in rec leagues in college. In rec leagues in high school. And now with a bunch of folks who just love the game. And that’s why it’s fun: it brings people together.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rescue Workers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rescue-workers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just read a book about the true “heroes” of this world with my kids. It illustrated the many perils that members of the coast guard, police department, fire department, and health care workers and such face.</p>
<p>I think about the souls who lost their lives trying to save victims of 9/11. I think about someone close to me who was flown on a helicopter to another hospital and saved there. I think about a friend in high school who was carted away in an ambulance because they collapsed right on the ground during the middle of a game.</p>
<p>We have an amazing response team in America. The fact that anyone can pick up their phone and dial 3 numbers and get help within 5 minutes from people trained to help is pretty incredible. It’s a safety net we don’t appreciate until we need it. And many in the world live without it.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Imagination</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/imagination.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was with my kids at the park as we go from tree to tree. One is my house. One is her house. One is his house. We’re playing neighbors, having ice cream, and cooking s’mores on a fire. None of these things exist.</p>
<p>It dawned on me for a moment: I wish I could see what they see. Where did it go - my constant imagination? It’s in there somewhere, the place where there’s no difference between dream and reality. The joy they feel at make believe Disneyland (the playground) and real Disneyland is in many degrees the same.</p>
<p>This is all because of their imagination. I’m grateful to have kids show me the many uses for a boring twig: a wand; a walking stick; a s’mores roaster; a knob to open a secret gate to the house; a portal to another world…</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Chirping Birds</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/chirping-birds.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Been hearing some birds chirp lately. It’s still January but around where I live it’s practically spring.</p>
<p>On early morning hikes I can sometimes hear the birds waking up. Sometimes a tree will be full of the little chirpers.</p>
<p>Why do birds sing? Why do they like singing more in the late winter, or after a rain storm? It’s a calming reassurance that we’ve all been hunkered down during a storm and are relieved to see the sun.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the beady eyes, the quick twitch of the head and neck, the instinctual liftoff when you get too close…maybe that’s why I like them. They’re just cool. Birds are cool.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for A change in perspective</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/a-change-in-perspective.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tonight there was a moment in my day where I wanted to change my perspective. For me, prayer is a helpful tool in changing my perspective. I believe God helps those who seek His help.</p>
<p>And I had a crazy experience with food poisoning a few days ago that, because I said a prayer, helped me turn it into something good.</p>
<p>Perhaps this can be a recurring prayer: make this challenge be for my benefit.</p>
<p>I’m grateful God loves His children and answers prayers.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for The Temple</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-temple.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tonight I went to the temple.</p>
<p>Inside every temple is a feeling of calm and peace. The people inside are all there to focus and learn about the Savior, which invokes a quiet reverence for the duration of the visit.</p>
<p>Today I came away reminded of the power of prayer. I’m grateful for the temple and the peace I feel inside.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Baseball Season</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/baseball-season.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Kids out in the field playing. Half of them picking their nose. Half the parents too. The grass is green. The hills are somehow greener. The sun peeking through the clouds. The batter who bunts on a full swing.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for America.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for A small, insignificant corner of the internet</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/a-small-insignificant-corner-of-the-internet.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As I’m perusing LinkedIn today, I see comments from past colleagues. It’s quite incredible to be able to connect in this way.</p>
<p>But also incredibly unnatural, from the long-standing view of humanity.</p>
<p>Humanity has always been about connecting people. Writing letters. Going on walks. Standing in the town square to share your message.</p>
<p>The internet is now the town square. And humans are manipulating the robots that command our attention. All social media sites optimize for time spent on their platform. More eyeballs.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s exhausting and addictive to continue to scroll.</p>
<p>Today, I’m grateful I don’t have to keep scrolling. I have a life to live.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Tee Ball</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/tee-ball.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The first thing I saw was 10 kids piling onto a loose ball. It was exactly the chaos I’d hope for.</p>
<p>I look around. I see beautiful green hills. I see parents cheering on their kids. I see kids having fun.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure other things could make me happier than being in a beautiful place with the people I love.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for The SEC Filings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-sec-filings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I took a look at good old Edgar. I looked up some investor relations material for a company I was curious about.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could sit and study the strategies and content written in all these 10K’s. Some do that professionally.</p>
<p>Surely, with dozens of lawyers and hundreds of accountants and analysts scouring these statements, they have some of the most interesting insights. Sure, they’re vague. But for a generalist trying to understand how the world works, they’re gold.</p>
<p>What a great thing to have this content freely at our fingertips.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I’m grateful to be in awe of AI.</p>
<p>I went to makersuite.google.com and fed Gemini 1.5 a 115 page pdf investor report and it retuned a summary with core elements with page references.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for My work team</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/my-work-team.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Joining my current company has been pretty great. Here are the things I’ve liked about it so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>people are kind.</li>
<li>They’re open to each other’s ideas.</li>
<li>They invite each other to lunch in big parties.</li>
<li>They laugh</li>
<li>They encourage each other</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s just a positive place. Where does this come from? It can only come from the top.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>, there’s a strong correlation between creative thinking and happiness. Having read things like <a href="../book-review/elon-musk.html">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="../book-review/steve-jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a> and one of the conclusions in the Elon book is “working for jerks is perhaps a necessity to get their high level of thinking.” There’s also the set of people who don’t want to work like that - where they treat each other with kindness and respect.</p>
<p>Here’s to my coworkers and those who created the work environment where people who are kind thrive.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for The Peak of a Hike</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-peak-of-a-hike.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It’s that moment where you stop walking because you walked to the destination you can no longer approximate.</p>
<p>It’s called a peak.</p>
<p>Human nature loves peaks. They’re exclusive. Interestingly, they’re probably far more tracked than random grassy spots in your neighborhood park. Because everyone wants to get to the peak.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I can hike. That I can choose random destinations. And that I can go to them.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today the family was watching General Conference on TV. I joined them and hopped under a cozy blanket. Suddenly, I felt off. Like I didn’t belong in the room. Like I didn’t belong awake.</p>
<p>And so I departed slowly into another realm. This is happiness.</p>

<p>Today I reached out to a customer support agent.</p>
<p>It took 90 minutes before the chat finally connected me to them. But they responded! And I think they solved my problem. TBD.</p>
<p>But it was great being able to reach out to someone I don’t even know who just answered my question!</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Mentors</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/mentors.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve had a lifelong mentor, Daron Shepard, for nearly two decades now. We first met when I was a sophomore in high school and he just joined the high school coaching staff.</p>
<p>Our relationship since that time has been many one on one phone calls. Sometimes he’s called me when he didn’t know how much I needed it.</p>
<p>And today he’s been calling me as a professional coach. Each time I talk with him I come away with better ideas on how to see things more clearly.</p>
<p>He’s like the giving tree. I keep coming back to him at different phases and he keeps helping me in new ways.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Wet Suits</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/wet-suit.html</link>

<p>I’ve been going to the beach for four years and have never gotten deep into the water. It’s frigid. I’ll skimboard along the surface or the little crash but never felt a need to go into the water. Besides, it’s freezing.</p>
<p>That’s not to say I wouldn’t want to if it’s warm - I love to body surf and boogie.</p>
<p>Recently I went back to the beach but with a wet suit in hand. Suddenly everything was better. The <a href="../gratitude/skimboarding.html">Skimboarding</a> was better because I wasn’t afraid of falling and getting a rash, or I wasn’t afraid of being cold. I could take the waves head on. And then I just went right out into the water and had the best boogie of my life on a solid wave.</p>
<p>It was incredible. I mourned that I’ve wasted 4 years.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Easter</title>

</div>
<p>I’m grateful for Easter. I’m grateful for the knowledge of a Savior. That He died, and rose from the dead. That He lives.</p>
<p>A belief in Jesus is a belief in quite a number of wonderful things:</p>
<ul>
<li>All people will live eternally. We will all get bodies because of Him.</li>
<li>Death is not the end, but just another step in an everlasting life</li>
<li>Sickness and pain is only temporary. In the hereafter there are joys untold awaiting us.</li>
<li>A God is willing to die for us. We are worth His love. His sacrifice. Each one of us.</li>
<li>There is unimaginable power in this universe that we can’t imagine even tapping. Who on earth can raise the dead? Not even the most brilliant doctor. But for Christ, it’s what He will do.</li>
<li>Families and beloved relationships will perpetuate beyond the grave.</li>
<li>There is always hope even in the darkest days. Christ was among an oppressed people. He was rejected by those he came to serve. He was crucified. But then he rose from the dead and it was finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are even many more blessings.</p>

</div>
<p>It’s hard to fathom how pretty these hills are. I see them every morning as I drive from my house. I see them in the distance. But their full beauty isn’t appreciated until my feet climb.</p>
<p>There’s something about being in the valley that causes me to think I know what’s up there. I’ve also been up there many times.</p>
<p>But the reality is it’s just its own thing. I gotta go see it to believe it. And it’s really worth believing.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Bodyfulness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bodyfulness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Mindfulness is a state of mind. But being present with one’s body is another matter.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/heal-your-nervous-system.html">Heal Your Nervous System</a> has been interesting as I’ve learned about additional senses beyond the five we commonly know. Certainly, meditating has had experiences for me that have been floaty feelings or what not.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’ve had these experiences and know what they are.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Fairy Houses</title>

<p>This is a fairy house:</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">This is a fairy house</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It took us hours to build, and I’m not sure where the idea came from, but we each took time building something for the house. There’s an A frame, a Bon fire, a ladder, a circle swing. And most importantly: a door to the fire pit.</p>
<p>My wife commented, “I kinda wanna go out and play out there.”</p>
<p>It’s magical. It was a special time to work on this memory with our kids. I’m grateful for these moments that parenting provides. I don’t know when else it’d be so exciting to hit glue some sticks together. But it was.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Ever Shifting Tides</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ever-shifting-tides.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The tech industry is pretty crazy. I was just watching some keynote talks from Nvidia and if they actually land half of the stuff they’re talking about, they’re going to just plow the world in a new direction.</p>
<p>I watch it and probably feel both awe and fear. What will the future look like? And will I do anything that cool? I kind of look at my little bag of talents and wonder how I fit into this big world.</p>
<p>But I do. I do fit in. I’m a part of that tide of shifting technology, of pushing the boundaries forward. I’m grateful for a job in tech. It isn’t easy. But it’s rewarding. It’s changing people’s lives.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Better Health</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/better-health.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Having the flu stinks. I realized quickly this week how a life revolves around health. My ability to do my job, to be there for my family, and even enjoy sitting on the couch is all impacted by what’s going on inside my body.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is: when I’m sick, I only want to get better and I realize what’s most important. But as I get better, my mind focuses in equal proportion on the normal preoccupations of life and I perhaps focus less on the things I had just realized were most important.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for good health.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for CS Lewis</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/cs-lewis.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Probably and odd thing to be thankful for, but I’m grateful for this guy’s legacy. Having read <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> I decided to read <a href="../book-review/mere-christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve read a few things by Lewis and have enjoyed his writing. It’s also fun to better imagine him writing it when he was at Oxford in 1940’s.</p>
<p>His writing continues to influence millions. I’m grateful he chose to write what he did even though people around him didn’t want him to.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Customer Service Agents</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/customer-service-agents.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I reached out to a customer support agent.</p>
<p>It took 90 minutes before the chat finally connected me to them. But they responded! And I think they solved my problem. TBD.</p>
<p>But it was great being able to reach out to someone I don’t even know who just answered my question!</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Mentors</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/mentors.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve had a lifelong mentor, Daron Shepard, for nearly two decades now. We first met when I was a sophomore in high school and he just joined the high school coaching staff.</p>
<p>Our relationship since that time has been many one on one phone calls. Sometimes he’s called me when he didn’t know how much I needed it.</p>
<p>And today he’s been calling me as a professional coach. Each time I talk with him I come away with better ideas on how to see things more clearly.</p>
<p>He’s like the giving tree. I keep coming back to him at different phases and he keeps helping me in new ways.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Wet Suits</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/wet-suit.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been going to the beach for four years and have never gotten deep into the water. It’s frigid. I’ll skimboard along the surface or the little crash but never felt a need to go into the water. Besides, it’s freezing.</p>
<p>That’s not to say I wouldn’t want to if it’s warm - I love to body surf and boogie.</p>
<p>Recently I went back to the beach but with a wet suit in hand. Suddenly everything was better. The <a href="../gratitude/skimboarding.html">Skimboarding</a> was better because I wasn’t afraid of falling and getting a rash, or I wasn’t afraid of being cold. I could take the waves head on. And then I just went right out into the water and had the best boogie of my life on a solid wave.</p>
<p>It was incredible. I mourned that I’ve wasted 4 years.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Easter</title>

</figure>
</div>
<p>I’m grateful for Easter. I’m grateful for the knowledge of a Savior. That He died, and rose from the dead. That He lives.</p>
<p>A belief in Jesus is a belief in quite a number of wonderful things:</p>
<ul>
<li>All people will live eternally. We will all get bodies because of Him.</li>
<li>Death is not the end, but just another step in an everlasting life</li>
<li>Sickness and pain is only temporary. In the hereafter there are joys untold awaiting us.</li>
<li>A God is willing to die for us. We are worth His love. His sacrifice. Each one of us.</li>
<li>There is unimaginable power in this universe that we can’t imagine even tapping. Who on earth can raise the dead? Not even the most brilliant doctor. But for Christ, it’s what He will do.</li>
<li>Families and beloved relationships will perpetuate beyond the grave.</li>
<li>There is always hope even in the darkest days. Christ was among an oppressed people. He was rejected by those he came to serve. He was crucified. But then he rose from the dead and it was finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are even many more blessings.</p>

</div>
<p>It’s hard to fathom how pretty these hills are. I see them every morning as I drive from my house. I see them in the distance. But their full beauty isn’t appreciated until my feet climb.</p>
<p>There’s something about being in the valley that causes me to think I know what’s up there. I’ve also been up there many times.</p>
<p>But the reality is it’s just its own thing. I gotta go see it to believe it. And it’s really worth believing.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Bodyfulness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bodyfulness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Mindfulness is a state of mind. But being present with one’s body is another matter.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/heal-your-nervous-system.html">Heal Your Nervous System</a> has been interesting as I’ve learned about additional senses beyond the five we commonly know. Certainly, meditating has had experiences for me that have been floaty feelings or what not.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’ve had these experiences and know what they are.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Fairy Houses</title>

</div>
<p>It took us hours to build, and I’m not sure where the idea came from, but we each took time building something for the house. There’s an A frame, a Bon fire, a ladder, a circle swing. And most importantly: a door to the fire pit.</p>
<p>My wife commented, “I kinda wanna go out and play out there.”</p>
<p>It’s magical. It was a special time to work on this memory with our kids. I’m grateful for these moments that parenting provides. I don’t know when else it’d be so exciting to hit glue some sticks together. But it was.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Ever Shifting Tides</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ever-shifting-tides.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The tech industry is pretty crazy. I was just watching some keynote talks from Nvidia and if they actually land half of the stuff they’re talking about, they’re going to just plow the world in a new direction.</p>
<p>I watch it and probably feel both awe and fear. What will the future look like? And will I do anything that cool? I kind of look at my little bag of talents and wonder how I fit into this big world.</p>
<p>But I do. I do fit in. I’m a part of that tide of shifting technology, of pushing the boundaries forward. I’m grateful for a job in tech. It isn’t easy. But it’s rewarding. It’s changing people’s lives.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Better Health</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/better-health.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Having the flu stinks. I realized quickly this week how a life revolves around health. My ability to do my job, to be there for my family, and even enjoy sitting on the couch is all impacted by what’s going on inside my body.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is: when I’m sick, I only want to get better and I realize what’s most important. But as I get better, my mind focuses in equal proportion on the normal preoccupations of life and I perhaps focus less on the things I had just realized were most important.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for good health.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for CS Lewis</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/cs-lewis.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Probably and odd thing to be thankful for, but I’m grateful for this guy’s legacy. Having read <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> I decided to read <a href="../book-review/mere-christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve read a few things by Lewis and have enjoyed his writing. It’s also fun to better imagine him writing it when he was at Oxford in 1940’s.</p>
<p>His writing continues to influence millions. I’m grateful he chose to write what he did even though people around him didn’t want him to.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the feeling of Skimboarding</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-feeling-of-skimboarding.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I only had 10 minutes to skimboard today. But I saw this little flat spot off to the side, where the waves were receding slowly. It looked perfect.</p>
<p>First one or two were a bit slow. But then I started to pick it up again. Pretty soon I was running compulsively to the next wave, just like when I was 22 when I really learned.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Then I had a great run. Hit the crash of the wave as best as I’ve ever done it. Didn’t wipe out. Just a great, energizing feeling.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Freedom of Religion</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/freedom-of-religion.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for the freedom of religion. I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-happiest-man-on-earth.html">The Happiest Man on Earth</a> right now and cannot fathom the horrid experiences Eddie had to endure.</p>
<p>When we (as humans) start labeling and blaming groups of people for our problems, we begin dehumanizing them and they’re no longer worth anything to us. And if we have power, we can choose to destroy them.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how depraved humanity can become. It happened to the Germans, but it can happen anywhere. It happened in the U.S. with slavery and civil rights failures.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the freedom of religion. It hasn’t always been free. My ancestors were shot at in Missouri and driven from their home in Nauvoo to cross the plains in the winter with nothing but dirt to eat to pacify their hunger.</p>
<p>They crawled on their hands in the frozen tundra because it’s all they could do.</p>
<p>Some survived. But not all.</p>
<p>Today I enjoy freedoms they didn’t have. The freedom to not have to cross a frozen tundra on my hands and feet because I’m a member of <a href="../concepts/the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.html">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Kids jumping on me</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/kids-jumping-on-me.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It won’t be long before they don’t jump on me anymore. I can’t help but think of how quickly it’ll have all gone by.</p>
<p>But I do cherish it. The tackle time. The giggles. The tickles. They need it. I need it.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for A sleeping baby</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/a-sleeping-baby.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Every night I put my daughter down to bed. It’s a sweet moment. She lays helplessly in my arms. I helplessly hold her.</p>
<p>Babies come into the world with so much trust. Trust I’ll do right by her.</p>
<p>And seeing her sleep is the best part.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It’s great fun reading <a href="../book-review/mere-christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a> because I’ve thought about several of these things before and am now just seeing him write about it much more effectively. I’m grateful for people who are good writers.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Sun on turf</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/sun-on-turf.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Growing up I played a lot of sports, namely football and lacrosse. One of the best things about playing lacrosse was that it happened in the spring, as the snow was melting and the town warming.</p>
<p>When it was cold in the early season, players would lay close to the artificial turf. It was soft, and retained the heat of the sun. It was sometimes the best way to warm up.</p>
<p>I think of that warmth when I lay in my backyard.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New Job</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-job.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I began a new job. It’s a new opportunity to get to know people, to build relationships, and to learn. It’s a chance to change, adapt, and develop.</p>
<p>Each company is its own little world, proving that there’s no one right way to build a business. There are millions of ways.</p>
<p>That’s cool.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Long Naps</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/long-naps.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I lay on the couch, having finished my taxes. My eyes get heavy. The kids are at peace. My wife asks, “are you going to fall asleep?”</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The eyes get heavy as the blanket warms up. The long stretch of the sectional welcomes me to fulfill its purpose.</p>
<p>And then it’s gone. Before it’s even been fully enjoyed…</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Dune</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/dune.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just watched the movie Dune again for the second time in four months. I’m excited for Dune 2 this weekend. And I’ve also read <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune-messiah.html">Dune: Messiah</a>…yea it’s been a Dune four months.</p>
<p>Dune got me back into fiction. I enjoy Herbert’s style of writing. Very smart, very thoughtful. You can tell he really thinks through a lot of things that he barely mentions in the book. I think this gives the book a certain richness - less is more. But when creating universes, those details provide a colorful backdrop.</p>
<p>I’m impressed by how good the movie is, and how true it is to the book. It’s rare to have a movie so close to the book.</p>
<p>It’s just fun to read.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the Barber</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/charlie-the-barber.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It was my first time visiting Mr.&nbsp;Barber today. He captured my attention as he stopped cutting someone’s hair, popped his head out the open door, and called “do your kids want a lollipop?”</p>
<p>A little different than asking kids to get into a van, but the principle is the same. It works. Who doesn’t like a lollipop?</p>
<p>He was hilarious. His wife was too (she cut my hair).</p>
<p>When I went to pay, I learned they don’t accept credit card. Cash or check only.</p>
<p>It wasn’t their first experience with this. “Just pay us back the next time you come in.” What?! Seriously?</p>
<p>I insisted I’ll be back soon. Mr.&nbsp;Barber seemed indifferent, “Nah, just come back whenever. No rush.”</p>
<p>His kindness reminded me of the reciprocity rule in <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a>. People feel like they have a debt they need to pay when you do something nice for them.</p>
<p>This obviously wasn’t Charlie’s goal: to have us not pay him. But he understands reciprocity. He knows he’ll see me again.</p>

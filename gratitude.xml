  <title>I’m Grateful for Long Runs</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/long-runs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2020 my friend invited me to train for a marathon. Against better judgment, I accepted. I started training in Jan of 2021, prepping for a June marathon.</p>
<p>I said yes because I needed an excuse to work out and I like listening to audio content. Also, I began running a lot in college, which was good times. The best part is getting to the top of a mountain, running a mountain trail, or discovering a new route. It all seems so natural and human. Just you and the land.</p>

</div>
<p>There’s something enlivening about a long run. There’s an endorphin kick that boosts your mental state. Then while running, you keep finding ways to make the same route a little bit longer. Or make it exactly 5 miles.</p>
<p>I often would push my kids in the stroller. I’m not sure how they survived, but they did. There was a great long lath that was a perfect 5 mile there and back, with hardly any interruption.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why this memory came back to me, because I’m pretty sure I never want to train for a marathon again. It’s horrible. It takes so much time. And then I got injured so I couldn’t even compete. But deep down there’s still a longing for a long run.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New York</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-york.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Since I was a kid, going to the city was a quarterly event. Whether going to the Bronx Zoo or the Met for a class field trip or a Yankees game, the city was always an adventure. As I grew up, it’d be the place to go to shows and concerts and visit family members who lived there.</p>
<p>Then when I was 22, I spent a summer as an intern there. Living in the city taught me what it means to be in the city.</p>
<p>From a guy who’d come up to help me with something on the Subway, to the lady who gave me some of her loose change to take the cross town bus, I was humbled by how people there look after each other. It’s hard to notice when the people are tough on the surface. But deep down they care for each other.</p>
<p>I’ve been to LA, and lived near SF, and DC and nothing compares to “city”.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Kindness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/kindness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been the recipient of a lot of kindness in my life. I know anyone reading this has too. Kindness is a wonderful gift to give someone. It doesn’t cost anything to be kind.</p>
<p>Ways people have been kind to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone called me when they knew I was making a big decision to listen to me.</li>
<li>Parents who showed me how to be kind to each other.</li>
<li>A friend who complemented me.</li>
<li>My wife who goes on dates with me and hangs out with me.</li>
<li>A child who wants to give dad a hug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindness does need to be <em>received</em>, I’ve learned. Kindness can be received when things are going well, as well as when life is tricky, though kindness is probably most poignantly felt and appreciated during hard times. I think that’s a gift: to receive kindness. It’s also a gift to give. Who do you know that could use some kindness today?</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Avocados</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/avocados.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“Aguacate, verduras!” It’s a common refrain you hear on the streets of <a href="../concepts/Honduras.html">Honduras</a>.</p>
<p>I first remember being woken up by this loud bark as a vendor walked the street inviting the entire town to enjoy his “avocados, vegetables!!”</p>
<p>I don’t blame him. I, too, want people to enjoy the things I like. And if this guy was selling avocados then I wanted to be buying.</p>
<p>It’s rare that I don’t want avocados on anything. Tonight, I enjoyed them on a hot dog, a classic dish called a “completo” in Chile. Put it on a burger. Put it on a hot dog. It’s like green eggs and ham, I’d eat it on a train, with a fox in a box. Here, there, anywhere.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for bowling</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bowling.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The car is put into park in the dark parking lot of the bowling alley. Rain descends, prompting hurried feet. The building door opens and we walk inside. <em>It’s bowling time.</em></p>
<p>Friends congregate, treats are consumed, and heavyweight spheroids enjoy the frictionless motion governed by Newtonian laws. The gutters are greedier than the pins, but regardless of where the ball ends up the hurler offers up a dance to the bowling gods, a laugh of disappointment, or a thrill of surprise. This has been the states of bowling regardless of the bowler’s age, across all known ages of my life.</p>
<p>The conversations, the dancing, the music, the flashing lights, the cheap food, the magic of self-returning balls - it is its own realm of simple enjoyment. Bowling won’t sell out stadiums, it’s rather boring compared to action sports. But that doesn’t stop anyone from enjoying it, and that’s why it’s a gift to humanity.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Home Depot Saturday Morning Crafts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/home-depot-saturday-morning-crafts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Home Depot gives out little assembly kits for kids on the first Saturday of every month. A few screws. A few pieces of wood. A simple design.</p>
<p>The chatter between children increases the closer they get to the supplier: a Home Depot working handing out presents to eager children.</p>
<p>Impatience grows the closer to the bag’s opening they become. They see other kids nearly finished around them. They can’t wait.</p>
<p>And so repeat the experience every first Saturday of every new month.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Peloton</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/peloton.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I grew up with exercise equipment in my house, and like most equipment for most people, I didn’t use it. Part of the reason was it was hard to get going.</p>
<p>There’s nothing easier than hopping on an exercise bike. Having been a runner most of my life, when I first got the Peloton I realized how nice it was to get a solid workout in 20 minutes. It’s just so easy with the little kilojoule calculator there.</p>
<p>And it could be any exercise bike, really, but I’m grateful for the one I have.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Compliments</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/compliments.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for compliments. The ones I receive and the ones I can give.</p>
<p>The cheapest thing you can give someone is a compliment. Yet it may be the most valuable gift to be given.</p>
<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a> which talks about “reciprocity”. People feel someone obligated to help you when you give them something, even if it’s nominal. Isn’t a compliment a gift?</p>
<p><a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> also discusses the benefits of being kind, and putting yourself in another’s shoes. Kindness far exceeds the benefits of criticism. A compliment is a way to think about what that person may want to hear and to give them that. Not in an insincere way, but in a sincere way.</p>
<p>People act how they want to be treated. If they show up to play basketball they want to be told they’re good at basketball. If they work on a task for you, it’s because they want to be told they’re good at that task. It doesn’t hurt to be nice. To give a compliment. So give away.</p>
<p>Being human is recognizing what other people aspire for and recognize that goodness in them. So notice. Notice what they’re after. Then give. Give freely, for so did He (<a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.html">Bread given freely, like His life</a>).</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just played some ball tonight. Not sure who invented this game, but it’s really come a long way.</p>
<p>The cool thing is that you can be horrible at shooting and still find a way to contribute. There are a lot of skills and abilities that make a good team.</p>
<p>I play with the same 20 guys, and it’s amazing how different combinations of 5 people play so differently. The flow, the passing, the defense - it all varies with who’ve you got on the court. And that’s what makes it fun. Sometimes you contribute more. Sometimes less.</p>

<p>I’ve played it my whole life, though never well. I played in rec leagues in college. In rec leagues in high school. And now with a bunch of folks who just love the game. And that’s why it’s fun: it brings people together.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rescue Workers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rescue-workers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just read a book about the true “heroes” of this world with my kids. It illustrated the many perils that members of the coast guard, police department, fire department, and health care workers and such face.</p>
<p>I think about the souls who lost their lives trying to save victims of 9/11. I think about someone close to me who was flown on a helicopter to another hospital and saved there. I think about a friend in high school who was carted away in an ambulance because they collapsed right on the ground during the middle of a game.</p>
<p>We have an amazing response team in America. The fact that anyone can pick up their phone and dial 3 numbers and get help within 5 minutes from people trained to help is pretty incredible. It’s a safety net we don’t appreciate until we need it. And many in the world live without it.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Imagination</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/imagination.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was with my kids at the park as we go from tree to tree. One is my house. One is her house. One is his house. We’re playing neighbors, having ice cream, and cooking s’mores on a fire. None of these things exist.</p>
<p>It dawned on me for a moment: I wish I could see what they see. Where did it go - my constant imagination? It’s in there somewhere, the place where there’s no difference between dream and reality. The joy they feel at make believe Disneyland (the playground) and real Disneyland is in many degrees the same.</p>
<p>This is all because of their imagination. I’m grateful to have kids show me the many uses for a boring twig: a wand; a walking stick; a s’mores roaster; a knob to open a secret gate to the house; a portal to another world…</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Chirping Birds</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/chirping-birds.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Been hearing some birds chirp lately. It’s still January but around where I live it’s practically spring.</p>
<p>On early morning hikes I can sometimes hear the birds waking up. Sometimes a tree will be full of the little chirpers.</p>
<p>Why do birds sing? Why do they like singing more in the late winter, or after a rain storm? It’s a calming reassurance that we’ve all been hunkered down during a storm and are relieved to see the sun.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the beady eyes, the quick twitch of the head and neck, the instinctual liftoff when you get too close…maybe that’s why I like them. They’re just cool. Birds are cool.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rock Climbing</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rock-climbing.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I participated in Boy Scouts growing up, and I got to go to High Adventure. This was a week where we’d go on an adventurous camping trip with a bunch of other teenagers. Things never went according to plan.</p>
<p>On one experience, I was repelling over a hang. After 30 feet repelling, I was then dangling over nothing. There was a double belay, one above and one below. This meant that either could help save me.</p>
<p>I was invited to let go of my first belay. Yes. Let go.</p>
<p>This meant I’d drop 150-200 feet in a free fall. The bottom belay would catch me.</p>
<p>I held the rope tightly in my hand as I looked off into the Appalachian mountains and the green trees dotting my surroundings. I looked ahead at the rock face, and up at the cliff hang. I held that rope for a second more before…drop.</p>
<p>And I fell, as planned! It was insane and it took all of half a second.</p>
<p>But then something unexpected happened: the first belay rope wrapped around my right leg. I turned upside down and instead of the belay stopping me, the burning of rope wrapped around my leg halted my descent. Didn’t feel good.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I didn’t die that day. That rope could have wrapped my neck. It’s possible I could have not stopped for some reason. It’s possible those guys who were my guides that day didn’t actually know what they were doing and it wasn’t as safe as they said.</p>
<p>That feeling of dropping was incredible though, as you never feel so heavy as when your hurtling towards the ground at gravitational constant acceleration.</p>
<p>I had many great experiences since then rock climbing, though I don’t go often. It’s just a cool thing to do. It’s cool people figured out how to do it and how to do it safely. I’m also grateful for high adventure - I learned a lot from those formative experiences.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New Perspectives</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-perspectives.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I was a kid, I broke my wrist. I no longer would be able to play football. It was my senior year, the year where all the magic happens. The year you prepare for. The big leagues.</p>
<p>My mom told me, “when a door closes, open a window. This if life”.</p>
<p>A new perspective is an opportunity to see something that was there all along, but because of myopia you didn’t previously see it.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">I felt like this when I dove for the football. But I didn’t look like this because I didn’t catch it. Instead I broke my wrist.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Perspective is realizing that senior year wasn’t any more special than the junior year where I had fun on JV. Perspective is realizing it’s just a game. Perspective is years later realizing that something I cared so much about at the time now has little value or importance in my life, and other things have far more importance to me.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Navajo Code Talkers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/navajo-code-talkers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>My daughter brought home a book that introduced something I had never before heard about: Navajo code talkers.</p>
<p>Since the Navajo language had never been written down, it wasn’t able to be translated by the Japanese in WWII. And so, the Navajo would encode English words and transmit their words across the radio to talk about positions and bombs and such. It helped them win the war.</p>
<p>They chose to serve a country they were being heavily persecuted in (<a href="../book-review/killers-of-the-flower-moon.html">Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI</a>). It’s incredible to think about.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for them and all like them that helped provide the freedoms I enjoy.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Early Morning Workouts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/early-morning-workouts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I played football when in middle and high school. Part of the high school routine was early morning summer workouts.</p>
<p>6:30 am is brutal for a 16 year old kid. But getting up, going to the school to run some sprints, get a lift in, and get home by 8 to shower and go back to sleep was always a great feeling.</p>
<p>I’m grateful that to this day I still value exercise. I know the benefits it gives me. I also know how to lift properly so I don’t hurt myself. I also have muscle/ligament memory where it’s easier to pick up after 6months of not exercising compared to someone starting from scratch. (Maybe that’s not a scientific thing, but I feel like it is 😂).</p>
<p>I’m slightly less grateful that my 16 year old self could bench more than I’ll ever again be able to bench, and run more than I’ll ever again have time to run, but perhaps I’m grateful I can challenge myself to surpass my teenage years.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Similarities</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/similarities.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Is there anything truly unique about any one individual? At the very least, any two people probably have eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose. They probably have brain and a heart. Probably have fingers and toes.</p>
<p>Probably have feelings. Experience love. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Resentment. Joy. Elation. Fear. Anxiety. Doubt. Faith. Fulfillment. Hope.</p>
<p>The reason why they feel these things will certainly be unique to them, but likely follow the themes of family, friends, food, shelter, fulfillment, etc.</p>
<p>I learned after being in Honduras for 6 weeks just how different I was from people across the world.</p>
<p>6 months later I learned (over time) just how deeply similar they are.</p>
<p>After 2 years I came home and deeply missed Honduras. I felt alone and lost in this American world.</p>
<p>Now I’m somewhere in between. But the point is: I’m grateful that humans can connect at a deeply human level no matter who they are or where they’re from.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Social Gatherings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/social-gatherings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week I went to a tiny venue concert. The person who invited me said, “Can you believe that just two years ago we were forbidden to gather like this?”</p>
<p>We were listening to a Honky Tonk/Rockability Banjo jammer who just absolutely slayed the whole night. The energy was off the charts. Everyone was dancing and having a great time.</p>
<p>I’m glad and grateful we can get together again.</p>

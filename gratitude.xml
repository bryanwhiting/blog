<p>It’s great fun reading <a href="../book-review/mere-christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a> because I’ve thought about several of these things before and am now just seeing him write about it much more effectively. I’m grateful for people who are good writers.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Sun on turf</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/sun-on-turf.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Growing up I played a lot of sports, namely football and lacrosse. One of the best things about playing lacrosse was that it happened in the spring, as the snow was melting and the town warming.</p>
<p>When it was cold in the early season, players would lay close to the artificial turf. It was soft, and retained the heat of the sun. It was sometimes the best way to warm up.</p>
<p>I think of that warmth when I lay in my backyard.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New Job</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-job.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I began a new job. It’s a new opportunity to get to know people, to build relationships, and to learn. It’s a chance to change, adapt, and develop.</p>
<p>Each company is its own little world, proving that there’s no one right way to build a business. There are millions of ways.</p>
<p>That’s cool.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Long Naps</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I lay on the couch, having finished my taxes. My eyes get heavy. The kids are at peace. My wife asks, “are you going to fall asleep?”</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The eyes get heavy as the blanket warms up. The long stretch of the sectional welcomes me to fulfill its purpose.</p>
<p>And then it’s gone. Before it’s even been fully enjoyed…</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Dune</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/dune.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just watched the movie Dune again for the second time in four months. I’m excited for Dune 2 this weekend. And I’ve also read <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune-messiah.html">Dune: Messiah</a>…yea it’s been a Dune four months.</p>
<p>Dune got me back into fiction. I enjoy Herbert’s style of writing. Very smart, very thoughtful. You can tell he really thinks through a lot of things that he barely mentions in the book. I think this gives the book a certain richness - less is more. But when creating universes, those details provide a colorful backdrop.</p>
<p>I’m impressed by how good the movie is, and how true it is to the book. It’s rare to have a movie so close to the book.</p>
<p>It’s just fun to read.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the Barber</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/charlie-the-barber.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It was my first time visiting Mr.&nbsp;Barber today. He captured my attention as he stopped cutting someone’s hair, popped his head out the open door, and called “do your kids want a lollipop?”</p>
<p>A little different than asking kids to get into a van, but the principle is the same. It works. Who doesn’t like a lollipop?</p>
<p>He was hilarious. His wife was too (she cut my hair).</p>
<p>When I went to pay, I learned they don’t accept credit card. Cash or check only.</p>
<p>It wasn’t their first experience with this. “Just pay us back the next time you come in.” What?! Seriously?</p>
<p>I insisted I’ll be back soon. Mr.&nbsp;Barber seemed indifferent, “Nah, just come back whenever. No rush.”</p>
<p>His kindness reminded me of the reciprocity rule in <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a>. People feel like they have a debt they need to pay when you do something nice for them.</p>
<p>This obviously wasn’t Charlie’s goal: to have us not pay him. But he understands reciprocity. He knows he’ll see me again.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for my Laundry Machine</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/laundry-machine.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Ode to the laundry machine. That tumbling beast. That water container with a motor. That rigid ridged dirt ridder.</p>
<p>I’ve lived without you at one point. I washed my clothes on a concrete slab for two years. I bloodied my knuckles on the slab, scraping back and forth.</p>
<p>By comparison, tossing clothing in, moving it from a wetting box to drying box, etc. doesn’t seem all that bad. It’s actually quite wonderful.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Choice</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/choice.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Choice is a concept. It’s a gift. It’s a freedom we all have to some, if not every, degree.</p>
<p>The simplest choice is to wake up. From there, it’s about what to eat. Drink. Where to walk. Move. Talk.</p>
<p>And that’s really all a day is - talking, walking, drinking, eating…all while being awake.</p>
<p>This is life. This is the power of choice.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Downstream?</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Life is kind of like going down a river. Can’t choose the rocks, but you can choose how to navigate them.</p>

<p>This isn’t a waterfall of much height, but water is falling down and over rocks. There’s nothing more beautiful in nature to me.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Guitars</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tonight I saw an international guitar concert, with four musicians from Italy, Australia, Brazil, and Vietnam. It’s incredible how each adapted the guitar to their own styles. One instrument, so much possibility.</p>
<p>I learned to play the guitar in college. It was the first time I felt like I understood what it meant to speak another language, despite having learned Spanish. Being able to communicate using an instrument was a powerful experience.</p>

<p>Once you get above the fog, it ceases to blind you and instead becomes something quite beautiful to behold.</p>
<p>That’s kind of like life. Problems can overwhelm and blind us, but looking back we’re glad at the beauty they’ve created in our life.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Copilot Money</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/copilot-money.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tech done right makes me happy. It’s also really hard to do because “right” is subjective. But an app designed with principles of simplicity, good colors and fonts, and hidden layers is always a good start.</p>
<p>Canopy Money has so many things I’ve wanted in Mint or tried to do myself with my financial system. It’s been a delight to see everything in one place. And things like connecting to Amazon to sync Amazon orders with credit card transactions is next level.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Marriage</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/marriage.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In reading <a href="../book-review/how-to-decide-simple-tools-for-making-better-choices.html">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</a> today, there was a section about how “getting an outside view” is essential to making good decisions. That we’re always better at helping someone else through a challenge than helping ourselves - because we’re all biased by our “inside view”.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a> there’s an anecdote mentioned about the allegory of the long spoons: <a href="https://sofoarchon.com/heaven-and-hell-the-parable-of-the-long-spoons/">Heaven and Hell: The Parable of the Long Spoons - Sofo Archon</a>. Essentially heaven and hell are both the same: it’s a room full of people with no elbows and long spoons trying to eat a sumptuous feast. What makes it hell is that they can’t bend their elbows to eat! What makes it heaven is that everyone is just feeding other people.</p>
<p>Marriage is a union of two no-elbow people. We benefit each other through an “outside view”, one that’s focused on helping and strengthen the other person.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for marriage and all my wife does for me.</p>

<p>Restlessness settles in his heart. He checks the forecast and it’s supposed to be raining, but it’s not. He checks again, and suddenly he has a 30 min window. After a morning working through personal finances and resetting 15 passwords, getting hit by a truck sounds like a better idea than sitting in the house for the next five hours.</p>
<p>“We’re going. Who’s comin?!” The ladies decline. Someone’s gotta be home for certain reasons. And some are just disinterested…or asleep. Okay, so it’s a boys trip. They go.</p>
<p>The wind continually reminded them they are nothing in this vast expanse. The movement of air from unknown regions into their hair and across the grass reminded them they are a part of something much greater. The shimmering hills remind him that he is more nature than he remembers to admit. That he doesn’t belong in front of a screen. That this is his home. His heart settles.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for The Coach</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-coach.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In walks a scrawny 15 year old kid. Low confidence. Can’t ask the girl out he’s had a crush on for a year. Can’t give himself permission to have the hope of asking her out.</p>
<p>He walks in reluctantly, he’s just a sophomore. The words “life coach” are projected onto a screen. The coach looks over the audience and welcomes the hesitant latecomer.</p>
<p>Almost two decades later, the coach is the one he calls. The coach is still coaching. The student still has much to learn.</p>

<p>I walk downstairs, the kitchen is clean. It’s 7:47 and I know at 8 it’s too late. Now is the time.</p>
<p>My wife opens the pantry, pulls out the bowls, mixes some ingredients, and I power wash some dishes. “Will you put this in the oven when it’s ready?” I wait for the beep. It beeps. I plop in the tray, it’s 8:01.</p>
<p>45 minutes later the tray emerges, having fulfilled its purpose. With a clatter on the table, warmth released from the oven and into the kitchen as the pan rested on the stove. Vanilla ice cream emerged from the freezer. Smiles ensued.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Board Games</title>

<p>Have you ever pulled out a board game when you’re in a rush?</p>

</div>
<p>No! You pull it out when times are good. When you’ve got time to play. Time to relax. Time to spend with loved ones.</p>
<p>I have memories playing Monopoly with my siblings, or Settlers with my high school friends, or Ticket to Ride more recently.</p>
<p>Games bring people together. I’m grateful for the people who make the games, for the people who create a market for them, and for the friends I can play with.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Book Club</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/book-club.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Belonging to a book club means you’re old. You’re so old that book clubs are how you have fun. Not playing pickup basketball. Not going to concerts. Not going to the movies. Not going longboarding down the canyon. A book club.</p>
<p>What’s better than any old book club? One with friends that you’ve already done all that other stuff with. One that helps you stay connected. One that inspires new ideas.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the boring book club. Because it’s fun.</p>
<p>It’s also fascinating how everyone picks up different insights. <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> talks about how hostage negotiators always have one speaker and three or four other people on the call trained to listen to just one thing. It’s because the mind can only process so much information. It’s cool to see how friends pick up on all that different stuff.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Explorers</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-wager.html">The Wager</a> right now and am enthralled and saddened by the horrible circumstances people had to go through on boats back in the day.</p>
<p>Without explorers, we wouldn’t have the knowledge of the world that we have now.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the freedoms we enjoy now, as most of us don’t have to fear about body snatchers coming to take us on a ship and force us to work until we die.</p>
<p>It’s the simple things, I guess…</p>

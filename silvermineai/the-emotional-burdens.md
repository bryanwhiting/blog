The emotional burden of solving a small problem for a low-paying customer is just as great as a high paying customer. It's just "another thing to do". 

I've also gotten lost in operational minutia. I've only called 6 people that my guy has given me. There are dozens. I need to prioritize calling people. 

People are very interested the first call and then i can't get a hold of them again. I try with different phone numbers so I don't think they've blocked me yet.

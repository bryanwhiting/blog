I have a commission only cold caller. He started last Thursday and has booked one appointment per 4 hour shift. Two of them didn't turn out to be interested (expected). 

Then my full time guy joined today. He was hard to negotiate with. He wanted $5/hour. I offered him double that, but in commissions. He pushed back. 

We settled on $2.5 per hour plus commissions. We went back and fourth three times. 

Why was this good?

Well it showed me he knows how to negotiate. Why hire a salesperson who can't negotiate?

Yesterday in 7 hours he booked 17 appointments. 

I don't know what to do. So I set up Calendly so he can book my calendar. And I set up zoom for zoom calls. And I integrated pipe drive.

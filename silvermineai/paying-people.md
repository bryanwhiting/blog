One worker had to borrow $60 to pay for internet so he could cold call. 

Yesterday his friend called him saying *he* needed the money to pay for *his* Internet. 

I paid him on PayPal for his time, but his bank closed his account. So he needs to pick up cash. 

Then another worker needed to pick up his $40. He's trying to work two jobs at once.

I respect them.

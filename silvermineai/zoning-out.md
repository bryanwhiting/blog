It's been ~10 days since I posted on Facebook. This week I got four new leads. Tomorrow I have two pitches that could change my life forever. 

Several times I just froze standing in the kitchen this week. Veronica asks "you okay"? Me: I just can't believe this is happening. 

Veronica: what do you need to do?

Me: everything. 

V: one step at a time. Write it down. Hire people to help you. 

Me: sends 3 job applications to the Philippines...

I paid someone $30 to figure out how I should pay him and the other team members. He provided me a solid recommendation. I felt relieved and followed his suggestion.

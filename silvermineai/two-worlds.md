There are two worlds in starting this business:

- I'm going to be wildly successful and be able to quit my FT job and buy a house on the beach
- This is going to crumble in the next 20 days and I'm going to lose all my money and have to fire these people that I just hired. At any moment it could all just go poof. 

There is no in between. It's just a game of tennis. This is anxiety. I hope it doesn't always have to be like this. 

When I take a step back and look at the bigger picture though, this is what my last month has looked like (See below). It's good to sit back and look. 

I believe this is going to work out. I do. It will because it's not some massive risk. It's very small but sized opportunities. Each client is their own. There is no coordinated systemic risk. I'm not swinging for the fences. I just need a few bunts per month. If bunt 1 misses, it's uncorrelated with bunt 2. They'll fall. People see the value. That's why it's going to be a slog, but it's also in my mind worth the hustle.

Dear team.

This week, the following has happened:

- several audits for new customers (thanks @Adrian, @Sean)
- Set up a few customers on GBP (thanks @Adrian!)
- Had dozens of cold calls that are still waiting for me to call them! 5/5 of the people i've talked to are interested. Great work @Guil!
- @Sean joined us. he's working on doing some cold calls and helping with some Local SEO audits. Welcome Sean!
- No new deasl this week, Had several people say they'll pay next week. one cold call from @Guil , and two of my friends. Once this happens, we're no longer losing money! (good for you - means you get more employment for years to come!) A lot of people are busy july 3-5 because of the holiday.
- Built out a website http://www.precisionconcretebayarea.com from @Joshua Dumalag. Congrats Josh! A few more finishing touches and the customer will be really happy!
- Made a pitch to a big apartment company. Hoping they close in the coming weeks.
- @Lou Elton Evasco started working with our customer CGRE to help with ads. 
- @VeNae Rosdahl built our customer's ads in Canva.
- We launched http://docs.silvermineai.com/services and other websites to share out to customers.
- We did a ton of behind-the-scenes work like onboarding flow @Mark Jayson Realino. just check asana for all the tasks Mark has put out!
- Spoke with a dental group (2 locations) that wants us. The marketer is sold (wife of the husband dentist), she just needs to check with her team. This could be a ~2k/mo deal!

Housekeeping:
- I paid most people as of the time of this post. if you haven't been paid, check your DM's.

Next week:
- Goal: sign 2 deals out of 3-4 that are hopeful. None are more than 2 weeks old since Guil's first cold call, it typically takes 3-4 fweeks to close. @Guilâ€™s confident that within time a lot of these folks will 

Team notes:
- Thank you for all the work that you're doing. As of June 7, none of you existed to me. Now we have 7 paid staff, 6 paying customers ($1515/mo MRR - all friends and family). This was an incredibly wild month. I honestly didn't think this was really possible, but here we are.
- I think we have our team - we're ready to scale to Ads and Social media, and we have plenty of support on Local SEO work. We'll focus on growing our business for the next month.
- I'm invested in helping each of you grow in your careers. Where there's hard work, I recognize it! I've already given 2 raises. I see what you put in! I want to support you and your families for years to come.
- We're all learning together. Thanks for your patience. I apologize if I'm not immediately responsive to every question. 
- When in doubt, take some actions and just let me know what you did! I doubt anyone is capable of messing anything up - you're all really smart and experienced. I may ask for some revisions, but I don't want to slow you down.

Let's go!!

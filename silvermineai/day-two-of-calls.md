Wild day. I set up Kixie and was uploading contacts as my freelance cold caller was getting rejected. We iterated on the script. Then another cold caller wanted to be more full time. So I offered her $1/hour. She worked one hour until she gave up. 

No appointments. But I sent my first invoice. I'll send another invoice tomorrow. I have two confirmed customers. I'm at $270/mo revenue. 

This is just the beginning.

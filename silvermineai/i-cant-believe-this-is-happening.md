I'm at 5 customers. Paid customers. Money is coming into the bank. I can afford to hire people to do a job. 

I've never felt so overwhelmed. I like pause and just stare. What am I doing? How do I make good on these commitments?

I'm at $1290 in monthly revenue. I had two calls today that felt like they were going to change my life. Two real estate developers that want to flip homes and stuff apartment buildings. Those could get me higher. 

So this is nuts. I'm feeling excited. Veronica is excited. She feels it happening. 

How is this happening?

I just closed my neighbor. Gonna set him up with a website. 

Charge for value. One booking all year will pay for the cost for him. 

Wild. Just wild.

I posted on Friday on Facebook that I'm starting a local SEO business. A few interesting things happened:

1. A coworker from an internship in 2012 reached out to me saying her company needs help with this. Meeting booked next Wednesday 
2. A mentor from my youth reached out cryptically saying "call me if you want to tell me about what your doing "
3. A person said "everything you just wrote describes what I'm feeling". Meeting booked Monday 
4. My Filipino cold caller found someone who at least listened to me. 10% chance of going through is higher than 0%. My Filipino cost me $0 because he's on a $300 commission (half of a whole months pay)
5. My own mother in law signed up. I hadn't even thought of her. 
6. I got maybe 2-4 other solid leads from things that could be a great match. 

8 hours replying to each person who liked my post. I want to build a community - not just spam people.  These 60 likes are my fans. People who like me enough to like it. Or like what I'm doing. 

$390 in recurring revenue. If Monday drops I'm at maybe +$225. That's $615. My phone center is $220/mo. My callers are free. My virtual assistant to help me is $500/mo. I'm a few hundred from breakeven. I still don't even know how to make a Google business profile, the thing I'm selling. 

But I understand what's going on, so I can sell. I just haven't done it yet. 

But I'm gonna learn. 

Takeaways:

- 10% chance of success > 0% chance. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. To build, put yourself in situations where you start off with a 10% but then get to the point of being able to be at 30% on the 20th try. Most of the time we prefer to be at 0% chance of success than 1%. 
- Quickest way to make money, and perhaps the only way, is to ask someone for it and offer them something more valuable to them in return. That's it. If you don't know what's more valuable to them than their money, just ask them.

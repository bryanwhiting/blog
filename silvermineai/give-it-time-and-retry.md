A week and a half ago I wanted to shut it all down. Fire all my guys. I was burned out. 

I kept the lights on though. I narrowed in. I worked on my system. 

I remembered I have a lot to learn. 

I'm terrified of getting rejected. But im not a sales person. I don't have to sell anyone. I can treat the call as a free consultation. 

Free is soft. It lets their guard down. 

"Hey this is a free consultation. Just curious to learn what you've done so far, bounce some ideas off you, and see if we can create some value for you. If so, we'll send you some more material and we can do a follow up call with our founder. So why are you interested in marketing services at this time? What's working, what's not working for you?

What have you tried in the past?

Great, our founders busy serving customers so we want to make sure we use both of your time wisely. Let's fix a time for a 15-30 min zoom call to review anything and discuss next steps. 

"Well, calling you at random hours isn't really conducive. You might be busy, or I might be busy. So if you're serious, let's commit to a time to chat and we'll set up a zoom link for 15 minutes."

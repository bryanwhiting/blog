What have I learned since June 7th, the day I announced my marketing agency on Facebook?

- There are so many entrepreneurs in my network. People building and growing. People with dreams of creating value in their own unique way. I think I've spoken to 15 people off that one post alone. 

- There are people who want to work with you. You just have to let them know you're open for business. 

- Creating value is about doing things that others don't have time for, but know is important. We all have 100 things going on in our overly busy lives. It's a relief to outsource those problems where we can. 

- So many ideas stall because people just forget of them. People tell me "I've wanted to do this for years but other priorities have taken place". Hiring someone can help provide a catalyst of new ideas and opportunities. 

- Some people are reasonably skeptical. So many scammers out there in the marketing world. I hope to make a difference. I see the opportunity for good marketing. 

- I've transitioned mentally from being an individual contributor to an operator. I've got four team members who just hammer away at tasks I send them. It's stressful, but exciting!

- Anyone using AI tools can do remarkable things. High schoolers on AI can do as much as a 5 year experienced individual. My team is remote and the tools they use make their work shine as good as I could have done it. 

- AI is enabling people with good ideas to provide exceptional value. I'm a software engineer by trade and being able to work with marketing AI tools is really exciting. 

- I'm exhausted. In the best way possible. I couldn't do it without Veronica Rosdahl Whiting's support. 

- it's fairly easy to give a really hardworking individual a life changing amount of money for doing solid work. I paid this guy $40 for helping me organize a bunch of stuff. He said it was life changing. Super humbling to learn of the great fortunes we have in the US. I could then hire him full time as my executive assistant and he's helping us serve our 6 new customers since June 7th.

- marketing is about following up. About showing up. Reach out to everyone who likes your post. Ask them if they know anyone. Ask them if there's some way you can help them.

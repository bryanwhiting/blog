Today we got our first customer from cold calling. It was a 45 minute call. Just explained what we do and the guy was interested. He kept asking more questions. 

Now I feel some pressure. Gotta deliver. Gotta help out. But I'm excited to have a first customer fully onboard. 

I'm okay to slow things down. To really focus on nailing the few customers I have. I don't want to outstrip my ability to deliver. Little by little. Keep customers happy. Keep them coming.

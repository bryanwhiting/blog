A cold caller just asked me if I wanted to sell my house. 

I said sure! For the right price. 

Then that didn't work out so I asked him if I could help him market his business. "What, you use AI? We're trying to use that!"

So I got his email and we'll see where it goes. There are opportunities everywhere.

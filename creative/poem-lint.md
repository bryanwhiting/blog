## Lint 

```
Lint between your fingers
Lint between your toes
Where does it comes from?
Only the windtraps know

You clench it like a prized possession
Its presence makes you my obsession
```

Seriously, it's like a [windtrap](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Windtrap) of Arrakis ([Dune](../book-review/dune.md)). Just appears.

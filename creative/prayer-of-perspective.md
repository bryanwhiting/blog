# Prayer of Perspective 

It's has been worse for others, it's currently worse for others, I'm grateful it's not worse for me. May God bless those who suffer more than me, that they may feel the love and comfort of He who suffered beyond them all. 

It's hard for me. The fact it could be worse does not change the validity of my challenge. Perhaps it's the hardest it's ever been. But it will be harder yet, and I do not worry about that, do I? So why worry about the difficulty now. This too shall pass, because He has created a way for healing for me and for all. 

It will be better. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe today. I know not what life holds. But because He has overcome all, it will be better. Through Him, I can 

I will pursue better. More healthy. More happy. The suffering of others or the suffering of myself does not preclude me from greater happiness any more than I should let the greater happiness of others prevent my current suffering. 

Life is all of this. The suffering and happiness of self. The suffering and happiness of others. 

The choice therein is to pray for others. To pray for self. To invoke the divine on behalf of all of us with great charity and love, and to pursue the available happiness in all circumstances beyond our control. And to pursue better circumstances within my control. And to ask for sacred circumstances only accessible through asking and only gift able under His control. 

# Context

I read [The Happiest Man on Earth](../book-review/the-happiest-man-on-earth.md) and wondered: how do I take Eddie's story and use it to better my life. That was His wish after all "I do not seek revenge. I chose to have a happy life - the greatest revenge possible."

Just because life is worse for others it dormant mean I can't improve my own. It's bad for others. It's been worse for me. It's been better for me. It's been worse for Christ. But Eddie wants us all to experience happiness. 

This is a prayer of perspective. Of acceptance.

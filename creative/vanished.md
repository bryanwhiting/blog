To do: a Short story about how I hear kids yelling in the other room and I walk there to see they're not fighting but are doing teenager homework 

Or I turn the corner while they're getting home from school and it's my baby in a cradle 

Or I drive to pick them up but show up at the park and discover I'm not married: this is the park I came to contemplate why I wasn't married. 

All past and present is one. Trippy. But wonderful too. Ghost of Christmas last, present, and future esc, but happening all once.

# Breath on
2024-02-12 
Bryan Whiting

```
You lay here on me
And I wonder
Are you breathing?

You are. 

How?

I wonder. How? You're only so little yet you know the key to life itself:

Breath. 

Breathe on. 

Your little chest rises and falls. 

Up. 

Down. 

Breath. 

You breathe on. 

My hand from palm to tip touches across the entirety of your rib cage. You're tiny. 

Yet you breathe. 

You breathe on me. 
```

Baby lays on me at near midnight. This is peace. This is life.

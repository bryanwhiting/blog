A twist on "[The Raven](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven)", by [The Best of Edgar Allen Poe](../book-review/the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.md). Poe got it all wrong.

## The Dove (Evermore)


3am I hear you wrapping   <br /> 
Desitin, I keep slapping   <br /> 
Diapers fresh, for poop, post napping   <br /> 
Diapers fresh, for my Adore   <br /> 


It was a cold and bleak December   <br /> 
Dark and dreary, as I remember   <br /> 
Sleepless nights and occasional frights   <br /> 
I'd forgotten the parent's implore:   <br /> 
please protect my Sweet Adore   <br /> 


Nothing strange, just parents living   <br /> 
Babies growing, always swimming   <br /> 
Through the tides of life they're dipping,   <br /> 
Dripping, tripping, slick socks slipping   <br /> 
Lovey, pants, they all keep ripping   <br /> 
"Will it stop?", my mind keeps slipping   <br /> 

I love them so, my Adore.   <br />
But I just ask rest, i implore.   <br /> 
Will I get it? "Nevermore"   <br /> 

What's that I hear, is something slapping?   <br /> 
NO! by Jove! A creature crapping!   <br /> 
Crapping on my kitchen floor   <br /> 
Right. next. to. the.. bathroom...door.....   <br />
I just cannot believe for sure   <br /> 
That creature must be *her* Adore...   <br /> 


Then in Jan a rain starts stalling   <br /> 
On my chest the baby falling   <br /> 
Napping, cooing, smiling, fawning,   <br /> 
My bedroom window, in Jan is calling   <br />
Calling in a creature, sure   <br /> 


"What's this?" I wonder, as I slumber   <br /> 
Is it just me, or am I dumber?   <br /> 
Is that a bird?! What's that number?   <br /> 

> "Animal control!" I now thunder
> "For the dove! Not one mess more!!"
> "Get out, you bird!" I implore!
> It cocks its head, "Nevermore"
> 

```
Something changed, as I remember
After that, cold, bleak December
The sleep rolled in, and so I weather
  Weather just a little bit more.
```



The baby's coos I now see freshly

The piqued smiles now enmesh me 

The drools of milk now refresh me

Refresh me, my Adore

How could I ever

have seen anything more?

Please don't let it end, I implore

The dove then whispers, "evermore"


The child calling, wailing, falling

At my feet, screaming, brawling

Incessant thumping, pounding, hounding

Is pleasant to my ears once more

Pleasant because they're my Adore


I see it now, that bright December 

It wasn't dark, I now remember

Just a fog, a dog, but nothing more. 

Now it's gone, and nevermore  

I took photos, Polaroids, sure

But now it's gone. And I want more. 


Remembered now are the cuddles

Long forgotten - spilled milk puddles 

Spilled milk puddles are nevermore. 


Days asleep and nights awake

Dream eyes open, for goodness sake

What I wouldn't give to take

Another look at my Make

Another look at my Adore

When I could hold her, and nothing more 

When in my hands, and on the floor

We cuddle, huddle, muddle sure. 

Bring it back, I implore. 

Turn back time, I want more 



Then entered in that dove once more 

The welcomed bird, the dove of yore

"The past is gone, it is sealed

But yours to keep, for it's real

past and present, Timespace is traveled

In eternity, your gift unravels

Forever more."

The tides of parenting are just phases. The good, the bad, the guilt, the lover all comes and goes. And then suddenly we realize it's all gone before we can blink. 

The newborn is now walking at my feet. The 18month old diaper generator is now four. The four-year-old brother slapper is now six and creating "Daddy, I love you" cards. Thankfully families are forevermore. 

*(Mostly) written 5:02am after a sweet midnight feeding, where she cooed and smiles right before passing out peacefully on my chest.*

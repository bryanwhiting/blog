How would you like to sleep next to a stranger?

How about *between* two strangers?

And sometimes you cuddle! But you can't pick the strangers. 

Oh! And all three of you are sleeping in chairs!

Does that sound like something you'd like? No? Hmm...

But what if you got a midnight snack, would that make it better?

Or if someone interrupted your sleep at 4am with an irrelevant megaphone announcement?

But what if there were not two, but 200 strangers? 

...Why can't I convince you? Okay, last try:

What if you all were sleeping in a moving object?

Going 700mph?

And everyone is suspended at 30,000 feet?

Yea, you'd like that? You'd pay a *lot* of money for that experience? Wow. 

Well, I guess everybody has their limit.

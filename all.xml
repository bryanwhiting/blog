  <title>Export your Libby Timeline to Obsidian</title>

<p>I love reading and I love writing. Both are integral parts of learning. The reading to receive new ideas, the writing to cement those ideas to something.</p>
<p>As I stood up my blog I wondered how to get past books on here. There’s a way!</p>
<p>I now use Audible and Spotify audiobooks, but most of my past reads come from Libby.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Libby</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Here’s how you do it using Python:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open Libby app and figure out how to export your timeline. Somewhere in settings. It’ll produce a CSV.</li>
<li>Go through that CSV and creat a column “read” that identified the ones you actually began (sigh…so many books I placed holds on but never read….)</li>
<li>Run this python script and it’ll create an obsidian markdown file for each. Tweak it to match your preferences. I personally use <code>quarto</code> to blog so I have a naming convention for the files and metadata.</li>
<li>Or! Just ask ChatGPT to do this for you lol.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
import os
import zipfile
import re

# Load the provided spreadsheet using pandas
file_path = "~/Downloads/libbytimeline-activities.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Parse the timestamp into the format yyyy-mm-dd and rename the column to 'date'
df["timestamp_raw"] = df["timestamp"]
df["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"], format="%m/%d/%y %H:%M")
# create a stringed date
df["date"] = df["timestamp"].dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

df[["date", "timestamp_raw"]]

# Custom column: Filter rows where read == 1 (went through spreadsheet to filter out those I had borrowed but never read).
df = df[df["read"] == 1]

# De-duplicate by title, keeping the most recent record (sorted by date)
df = df.sort_values("timestamp", ascending=False).drop_duplicates("title")

# Create a new column 'created' with today's date in yyyy-mm-dd format
today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
df["created"] = today

# Create a new column 'date-finished' that's the timestamp's date + 21 days
df["date-finished"] = (df["timestamp"] + timedelta(days=21)).dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Prepare for markdown file creation
output_directory = os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/markdown_files")
os.makedirs(output_directory, exist_ok=True)

# Loop through each item in the dataframe and create a markdown file
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    markdown_content = f"""

    with open(file_path, "w") as file:

<p>Just played some ball tonight. Not sure who invented this game, but it’s really come a long way.</p>
<p>The cool thing is that you can be horrible at shooting and still find a way to contribute. There are a lot of skills and abilities that make a good team.</p>
<p>I play with the same 20 guys, and it’s amazing how different combinations of 5 people play so differently. The flow, the passing, the defense - it all varies with who’ve you got on the court. And that’s what makes it fun. Sometimes you contribute more. Sometimes less.</p>

<p>I’ve played it my whole life, though never well. I played in rec leagues in college. In rec leagues in high school. And now with a bunch of folks who just love the game. And that’s why it’s fun: it brings people together.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 18 - The Power of Prayer</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Nephi has two powerful verses about prayer:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-18.3">1 Nephi 18.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we pray often, we are shown great things. And then after he’s tied up and being beaten by his brothers. According to what he wrote, this is the first thing he did when he was released:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-18.21">1 Nephi 18.21</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do I turn to the Lord the moment something goes wrong? <a href="christianity/turn-to-god-not-your-idols.md">Turn to God in All Things, and Not Your Idols</a></p>
<p>The winds in our life can cease when we turn to God.</p>

<p>2024-01-30 - Ackerman method from <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> applies to the concept of anchoring. Better to anchor at $2 then tell them $200 off than play a joke at $10000 but only offer $200. - Reciprocity - the small things compound over time. Give more than you expect to get.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 17 - He will strengthen us</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Consider how the Lord provided for Nephi and his people</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.<br>
And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he <strong>doth nourish them, and strengthen them</strong>, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-17.2-3">1 Nephi 17.2–3</a></p>

<p>The Lord intends to strengthen me to overcome the trials ahead, not to take them away. The purpose of the life is to be strengthen. Whenever we feel overwhelmed, we can take those things to the Lord.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 16 - Christ Guides us in Unique Ways</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-16-christ-guides-us.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Lehi had a humbling experience as he was complaining at how hard the journey was:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-16.25">1 Nephi 16.25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Lord chastened Lehi, he pointed Lehi to the Liahona for next steps:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-16.26">1 Nephi 16.26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord was <em>already</em> speaking to Lehi, so why did he tell Lehi to look at the Liahona? Why not just tell him what next to do?</p>
<p>An interesting thing happened with the Brother of Jared as well:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. <strong>And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.14">Ether 2.14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-christ-standing-brother-of-jared.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Christ standing with the Brother of Jared in a cloud</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In this case, the Lord just told him the next steps: “Go to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built.” (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.16">Ether 2.16</a>)</p>
<p>Why did Lehi get a compass, and the Jaredites not? Why did the Lord point Lehi to get his answers from the compass, but just told brother of Jared what next to do?</p>
<p>Well, I’m sure it’s not so black and white. But the fact that there <em>is</em> a <em>black</em> and a <em>white</em> way in which the Lord teaches us is my point.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord tells us what to do (black). Sometimes he reminds us of the things he’s already given us (white). He reminds us of words from the scriptures. He reminds us of past prayers. He reminds us to pray.</p>
<p>And if we look more closely, we actually <em>do</em> see a similarity between Brother of Jared and Lehi because they “built barges after the manner which they <strong>had</strong> built, according to the instructions of the Lord.” (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.16">Ether 2.16</a>)</p>
<p>Meaning: they already had the answer and the Lord just had to remind them.</p>
<p>Meaning: their liahona was the fact that they already had directions from the Lord.</p>
<p>Let’s go back a little. Earlier in Jaredite journey, they were being very deliberately lead by the Lord:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and <strong>gave directions whither they should travel.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.5">Ether 2.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but the Lord gave them instructions on how to build a barge:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and <strong>did build barges</strong>, in which <strong>they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.6">Ether 2.6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Lehi and Brother of Jared were both pointed in the direction they should go. But the Lord teaches them each in their own way. For Lehi he gives him a Liahona and tells him to read the words therein. This is a physical tool, kind of like the Book of Mormon and other scripture. We should not be surprised if sometimes the Lord tells us “go to the scriptures, I will answer your question there” or “listen to general conference”. The Lord often points us to places where He’ll speak to us, giving us opportunities to show our faith and do our part.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes he may guide us by the hand and show us the way to go. He may directly just tell us to go one way. This is another way of His for interacting with us.</p>
<p>And interestingly, he later told brother of Jared “remember those barges I gave you four years ago? Rebuild more.” He didn’t necessarily give them more designs but reminded the Jaredites of how he had already guided them.</p>

</div>
<p>There is power in remembering the things the Lord has already done for us. We shouldn’t always seek new signs. We should seek to remember. And in remembering, we’re lead anew.</p>
<section id="what-i-learned" class="level1">
<h1>What I Learned</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Lord guides the same person in different ways</li>
<li>He guides two people in the same circumstance in different ways</li>
<li>He asks us to remember</li>
<li>If we’ve embarked on the journey, even if we stumble, he’ll lovingly chastise us to remember the Way</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>I take solice in that He wants to guide me personally. He may ask me to read my scriptures. He may remind me of a past time. He may give me specific instructions. He may just expect me to walk or build and do the thing I’m supposed to do. Keep going until you receive further instruction.</p>
<p>He’s also actually heavily involved in the details it seems. We may wander lost (Israelites) or be caught relaxing for four years on the beach (Jaredites), but He’s still very heavily involved. I can trust He loves me and wants to guide me.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rescue Workers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rescue-workers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just read a book about the true “heroes” of this world with my kids. It illustrated the many perils that members of the coast guard, police department, fire department, and health care workers and such face.</p>
<p>I think about the souls who lost their lives trying to save victims of 9/11. I think about someone close to me who was flown on a helicopter to another hospital and saved there. I think about a friend in high school who was carted away in an ambulance because they collapsed right on the ground during the middle of a game.</p>
<p>We have an amazing response team in America. The fact that anyone can pick up their phone and dial 3 numbers and get help within 5 minutes from people trained to help is pretty incredible. It’s a safety net we don’t appreciate until we need it. And many in the world live without it.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Imagination</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/imagination.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was with my kids at the park as we go from tree to tree. One is my house. One is her house. One is his house. We’re playing neighbors, having ice cream, and cooking s’mores on a fire. None of these things exist.</p>
<p>It dawned on me for a moment: I wish I could see what they see. Where did it go - my constant imagination? It’s in there somewhere, the place where there’s no difference between dream and reality. The joy they feel at make believe Disneyland (the playground) and real Disneyland is in many degrees the same.</p>
<p>This is all because of their imagination. I’m grateful to have kids show me the many uses for a boring twig: a wand; a walking stick; a s’mores roaster; a knob to open a secret gate to the house; a portal to another world…</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Chirping Birds</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/chirping-birds.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Been hearing some birds chirp lately. It’s still January but around where I live it’s practically spring.</p>
<p>On early morning hikes I can sometimes hear the birds waking up. Sometimes a tree will be full of the little chirpers.</p>
<p>Why do birds sing? Why do they like singing more in the late winter, or after a rain storm? It’s a calming reassurance that we’ve all been hunkered down during a storm and are relieved to see the sun.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the beady eyes, the quick twitch of the head and neck, the instinctual liftoff when you get too close…maybe that’s why I like them. They’re just cool. Birds are cool.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 15 - Hearken and Hold Fast</title>

<p>Who do we listen to?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-15.24">1 Nephi 15.24</a></p>

<p>To learn biology, do you go to the math teacher? To learn happiness, perhaps the Source of truth and light can be our Teacher.</p>
<p>Once we learn truth, everything else becomes a lot more clear. And once we know what clear looks like, we don’t heed the distracting darts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hearken (listen, read, pay attention to, follow)</li>

  <title>Become a Data Scientist in 10 Weeks</title>

<p>How do you get a job in data science if you currently aren’t a data scientist?</p>

<div class="callout-icon-container">

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>The simplest thing you can do to get experience is do 5 Kaggle competitions and use ChatGPT like crazy to learn how to code, annalyze data, and build models. Use the ChatGPT code interpreter for $20/month and see how it works. Test its limits. If you’re new to data science, you won’t understand where it’s wrong, so just ask it: “how might this answer you gave me be wrong?”</p>
<p>The rest of this focuses on how to master the fundamentals, which will take you much farther and give you a foundation to build off of. But when in doubt, “doing” data science is much better than “learning” data science from books. Always strike a balance in your efforts: it takes far less time to read and learn principles, but it’s far more valuable to try “doing” a data science project with code.</p>

<section id="my-path-to-ds" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>My path to DS</h1>
<p>I asked this question while working as an analyst 8 years ago and wanting to break into data science. I wrote about it back then (lost the post), so I’m gonna revisit it now.</p>
<p>I was asked this question today: “how do I get started and get a job in data science if I don’t have any experience?” You may then wonder “I can’t get experience without a job…this is a chicken-and-egg problem.” False.</p>
<p>Simple: get experience. For free. In 10 weeks. Write a good resume. Network like crazy: connect with real people (and not just spam). Get rejected probably 20-30 times, learn from each rejection, keep learning and presto, you’ll finally have an offer. It’s honestly just a numbers game. Everyone “ahead” of you is an imposter just like you. Just figure out enough basics and you’ll be ready for your first job.</p>
<p>There are a million ways to do this, and a million blog posts like this one. But here’s my suggestion. Enjoy!</p>

<section id="no-single-data-science-definition" class="level1">
<h1>No Single Data Science Definition</h1>
<p>Look at 10 job postings for data science and you’ll see 10 unique definitions for a data scientist. Roughly, I’d categorize them as such:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Human decision support: someone who supports others in their decision making. This would be their boss, their team, etc. Decisions are: should we shut this line of business down? Are our customers churning and how do we prevent that?</li>
<li>Machine Decision Support: someone who helps machines make automated decisions, like whether to approve an online credit card application, recommend a YouTube video, etc.</li>
<li>Product developer: someone who uses data to build a web product or service. This is similar to machine decision support, but the role might be in a SaaS capacity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these things below will help with 1-2. Today, AI products are all the rage and I offer one week on deep learning to get you interested in 3. That being said, all the principles in each one of these sections is important in any field you pursue. # Mindset</p>
<p>While doing the following, on weeks 2-10, write one blog post to outline what you learned.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Where did you start? Why was it hard to learn? What did you want to know?</li>
<li>What concepts were new to you?</li>
<li>Do something with that knowledge. Search the internet to find data you can write about.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t get very far, just move on to the next topic. Breadth is better early on to find out what you enjoy. Don’t get caught up in the details. Skim more. Write more. Worry less. You got this.</p>
<p>In all things, use ChatGPT to tutor you. Ask it questions. Be relentless. Have it explain things to you like you’re five.</p>
<p>Balancing learning between real books and ChatGPT is the best combo. ChatGPT is a better teacher, and the books have real info in them you can more fully trust. Using both together will get you there faster.</p>
<p>If any of the books below don’t vibe for you, there are a million free books out there. Find a simpler one and the same topic (and post in the comments so I can add it!)</p>

<h1>Week 1: Prepare to Share</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By creating a blog you demonstrate the following: you like to learn, you can communicate, you can do hard things, you’re naturally curious, you’re contributing to the ecosystem. Lots of ways to show those things, but having a blog is at least one way.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Set up a blog.

<li>Medium.com</li>
<li>Substack.com</li>
<li>(Harder) Or use <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> and publish on GitHub</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find 5 blogs by top data scientists. Read their posts. See what they write about.</li>
<li>Your first blog post is about what you like about these 5 blogs.</li>
<li>Share your blog post on all social media. LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook.</li>

<li><a href="https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/">Telling Stories with Data</a></li>
<li>Find three data-focused blogs that use charts and analysis. Economist, FiveThirtyEight, DataIsBeautiful, etc.</li>

<h1>Week 3: Analytics and Data Intuition</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To be able to make predictions about the future, you first need to understand how to understand the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analytics is the foundation of data science. It’s the process of manipulating data and reshaping it to see it in new ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wesmckinney.com/book/">Python for Data Analysis, 3E</a> - written by the creator of <code>pandas</code></li>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science (2e)</a> - written by the creator of <code>dplyr</code>, the best data manipulation language ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these books are great. Read both. It’s good to learn early that there are multiple right ways of doing your analysis the wrong way 😉. Seeing how to think in two languages is actually easier than getting stuck on one.</p>

<p>Learning how to make a plot is like learning how to write. Learn how colors work. When to use them. When to use a bar vs.&nbsp;a line chart. How to make ideas shine.</p>

<p>This is after analytics because analytics is more important (knowing what to look for and how to think about data) than plotting it.</p>
<p>There are two types of plots: those for you to learn from and those for others to learn from. First, learn what’s in the data. Learn for yourself.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Look at the plot. Look at the plot. No seriously, look at the plot.” Chris Peterson, Capital One</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, plot for other people. After you’ve learned something by sifting out all the noise, learn how to communicate that externally.</p>
<p>Beautiful plotting is really hard and time consuming. Details can take hours. Focus on the basics at first. The simplest plot focuses on “what’s the one thing I want someone to take away from this?”</p>

<h1>Week 5: Get Data You Don’t Yet Have</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you work at a company &gt; 50 people, your company’s data is probably stored in a database. Learning how to get this data so you can do data analytics and visualization will help you be self sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analytics is more important than this, because someone else may be able to get you the data. Or, once you know analytics then you can use SQL to <em>do</em> analytics.</p>
<p>Three primary ways to get data include the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SQL (from a database, returns a spreadsheet like table)</li>
<li>API (get data from a website, returns JSON data)</li>
<li>Webscraping (getting it yourself, this is considered “unstructured” data)</li>
</ol>
<p>Interactive tutorials here are the way to go. Just google around for some good ones.</p>

<p>If you’re making automated decisions with data, you’re probably using a recommendation system at some level. Recommendation systems typically focus on “what video does Bryan want given all the data we have on him and people like him?”. But the principles also extend to: how do I recommend one course of action to my stakeholder?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t have great resources here, but getting the concepts down will help you understand how virtually every social media app or streaming service works. (Netflix, Spotify, Instagram, etc all use recommenders to figure out the content you’re interested in. )</p>

<p>Now you’ve got 10 blog posts, which is 10 more bullet points on your resume than you had before you started. You’ve learned a ton if you only do 10% of all that’s above.</p>
<p>I’ve loved the advice I found written up here: <a href="../posts/2022-11-18-writing-a-tech-resume/index.html">Writing a Tech Resume</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have a good resume, find real people to give it to. Dont apply blindly online. Talk to everyone you know. Find people on LinkedIn and message them directly with a personal message. Use one of your blog posts in your message to tell them why you’re a good fit for their role. Perhaps even write a blog post specific to data from their company!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rock Climbing</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rock-climbing.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I participated in Boy Scouts growing up, and I got to go to High Adventure. This was a week where we’d go on an adventurous camping trip with a bunch of other teenagers. Things never went according to plan.</p>
<p>On one experience, I was repelling over a hang. After 30 feet repelling, I was then dangling over nothing. There was a double belay, one above and one below. This meant that either could help save me.</p>
<p>I was invited to let go of my first belay. Yes. Let go.</p>
<p>This meant I’d drop 150-200 feet in a free fall. The bottom belay would catch me.</p>
<p>I held the rope tightly in my hand as I looked off into the Appalachian mountains and the green trees dotting my surroundings. I looked ahead at the rock face, and up at the cliff hang. I held that rope for a second more before…drop.</p>
<p>And I fell, as planned! It was insane and it took all of half a second.</p>
<p>But then something unexpected happened: the first belay rope wrapped around my right leg. I turned upside down and instead of the belay stopping me, the burning of rope wrapped around my leg halted my descent. Didn’t feel good.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I didn’t die that day. That rope could have wrapped my neck. It’s possible I could have not stopped for some reason. It’s possible those guys who were my guides that day didn’t actually know what they were doing and it wasn’t as safe as they said.</p>
<p>That feeling of dropping was incredible though, as you never feel so heavy as when your hurtling towards the ground at gravitational constant acceleration.</p>
<p>I had many great experiences since then rock climbing, though I don’t go often. It’s just a cool thing to do. It’s cool people figured out how to do it and how to do it safely. I’m also grateful for high adventure - I learned a lot from those formative experiences.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 14 - Convincing unto Peace</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-14-convincing-unto-peace.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Lord gives unto us according to our desires:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a great and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other—either to <strong>the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal</strong>, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of which I have spoken. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-14.7">1 Nephi 14.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that He cannot take away our agency. So he doesn’t come to judge us or cast us to lots of good or evil.</p>
<p>People self select. They choose for themselves in their own life.</p>
<p>And this is the marvelous work: to be convinced of peace.</p>
<p>Am I “convince” of peace as stated above? Do I recognize that the peaceful way is always the best way through?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-convincing-of-peace-dove-two-guys.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Convince me unto peace, please!</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>No, it says “convincing of them <em>unto</em> peace”, meaning that convincing them of Jesus, which leads to peace. But the sentiment is the same: that living a life of peace is the one I want.</p>

  <title>The Only Mind that’s Clear Is the One That Sees No Alternative</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The easiest thing one can do is see the world through their own viewpoints. It takes no effort. Takes no work. It’s already done: your viewpoints are there. Either you care about climate change today or you don’t. Either you care about opossums or you don’t. You are who you are, right now.</p>
<p>The only gap between who you are today and who you are tomorrow is what you learn and experience and how you see the world because of what you learn and experience.</p>
<p>You learn from others. You learn from your experiences. You learn from other’s experiences.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t to be right. The goal is to understand.</p>
<p>And so, I believe in the value of learning from those around me, especially those I disagree with. It’s hard work to grind through walls of disbelief or misunderstanding. But it’s always worth it, even if at the other side you merely understand. That in and of itself is a destination worth pursuing because of the many benefits it yields.</p>
<p>But beware, with an assumption of understanding comes peril. Therefore, the goal is to constantly seek understanding, because no person is every the same one day to the next.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New Perspectives</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-perspectives.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I was a kid, I broke my wrist. I no longer would be able to play football. It was my senior year, the year where all the magic happens. The year you prepare for. The big leagues.</p>
<p>My mom told me, “when a door closes, open a window. This if life”.</p>
<p>A new perspective is an opportunity to see something that was there all along, but because of myopia you didn’t previously see it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">I felt like this when I dove for the football. But I didn’t look like this because I didn’t catch it. Instead I broke my wrist.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Perspective is realizing that senior year wasn’t any more special than the junior year where I had fun on JV. Perspective is realizing it’s just a game. Perspective is years later realizing that something I cared so much about at the time now has little value or importance in my life, and other things have far more importance to me.</p>

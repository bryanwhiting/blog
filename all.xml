  <title>New business Checklist</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/new-business-checklist.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Getting paid is easy. Getting paid the right way is harder.</p>
<p>You don’t need to have an LLC.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get an address. You can use your own, but safer to pay $10/mo for a postal box. I use Ipostal.com</li>
<li>File an LLC. Use Incfile. Get it done right if you’re doing this business with a partner.</li>
<li>Using the EIN, go register a small business bank account. I chose Chase only because they do</li>
<li>Create a website.</li>
<li>Accounting software (Freshbooks)</li>
<li>On Freshbooks you can connect to strip. You need a website first.</li>
<li>Get an email provider. (Outlook or Google) You don’t need a website to do email, but you do need a domain. You can have anyone host your website, anyone register your name, and anyone do your email. But the company that registers your url will be the place where you manage your DNS records to set up your email.</li>
<li>Track your expenses separately. They’re all a tax write off.
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a separate credit card, perhaps a small business credit card, for just this purpose.</li>
</ol></li>
<li></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>remove someone’s “gut” and they give better predictions</li>
<li>Ask not what is true, but what it’s true of.</li>
<li>Simple algorithms &gt; judgment on average.</li>
<li>Don’t focus on the recruits, but on the interviewers - remove their biases.</li>
<li>If mueller lyar lines can deceive us in something so simple, how can we comprehend the complex?
<ul>
<li><a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> → if you can recognize it you can avoid being deceived.</li>
<li>→ data science. “Oh nice result!” → nope it’s just an illusion. Learn to recognize.</li>

</ul>
<p>Amos:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s the little decisions that are the most revealing because the big ones are mostly luck. The systematic decisions. The consistent ones.</li>
<li>the nice thing about urgent things is if you wait long enough they’re no longer urgent.</li>

  <title>Pinball Loss</title>

<p>I just learned about Pinball Loss: <a href="https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/how-i-made-peace-with-quantile-regression">How I made peace with quantile regression</a></p>
<p>Essentially, it’s a loss function that penalizes over vs under predictions. It can be used to help perform quantile regression and bias the predictions over or under the mean (which is what quantile regression does).</p>

  <title>The Road</title>
  <dc:creator>Cormac McCarthy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/the-road.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I felt like most of the book was hard to follow. All the flowery detail had themes in it I wanted to take something from but decided it wasn’t worth rewinding for. So I stuck high level to the dialogue.</li>
<li>The most powerful moment was the father saying “you’re not the one who has to worry about everything” and the boy replies, “yes I am”. He’s the one that has to worry because he’s going to survive while his dad dies.</li>
<li>His dad said he’d join his son in death, but didn’t tell his son to join him.</li>
<li>The father was a good scavenger, but there was a group following them the whole time and he never noticed.</li>
<li>survival is about movement. I think in many ways we’re all choosing to move somewhere. Gotta keep moving, or else you die. Even in a world filled with death, movement is life.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-07</p>
<ul>
<li>you’re not the one who has to worry about everything. → yes, I am. I am the one. → they hold the fire.</li>
<li>Theme: the conscience of a child. He saved his dad from becoming like the rest: savages.
<ul>
<li>A scared child offers to help.</li>
<li>A scared adult fights to survive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Child avoids going places that makes him scared.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-06</p>
<ul>
<li>there’s no certainty about anything expect death: “there’s no fathers and no book. They’re all dead” yet he doesn’t</li>
<li>Death is the only thing down the road for anybody</li>
<li>We carry the light.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-05</p>
<ul>
<li>as I reflect on the halfway point: there’s probably more about this book than initially seems.</li>
<li>The world he walks in is devoid of any law. Just tribes and loners walking the planes. That’s perhaps how people would operate if there’s no society.</li>
<li>Interestingly, human nature is such that it seeks tribes within societies. Teams to root for. Alliances at work. Political factions. In essence, we’re the same scavengers but dressed up somewhat because of these laws. But within the laws, we still do those base human things.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-04</p>
<ul>
<li>theme: kid saying let’s go vs dad saying let’s go.</li>
<li>#Theme: is killing yourself or a loved one better than suffering the horrors of being alive? <a href="../book-review/of-mice-and-men.html">Of Mice and Men</a> and Lenny’s fate.
<ul>
<li>Dad debating if he can kill his son</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can’t help people you want to help if you don’t have the resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions: - Where are they going? Why south? - Who are the factions? How do they know the factions?</p>
<p>2024-05-03</p>
<ul>
<li>what’s the difference between what never was and what never will be?</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-02</p>
<ul>
<li>you forget what you want to remember and remember what you want to forget</li>
<li>Dreams of men in peril should be of peril, otherwise they’re just mirages.
<ul>
<li>→ dream in reality.</li>
<li>Impossible to wake from the day dream.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-05-01</p>

  <title>Emotional Intelligence for Sales Success</title>
  <dc:creator>Colleen Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/emotional-intelligence-for-sales-success.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Connections - rewire your brain</p>
<p>Core takeaways: - Book time for prospecting. Protect that time. - Lighten the mood, build a relationship.</p>
<p>Summary: - sales is about a relationship, not a vendor ship. It’s treating people kindly. Treating your employees the way you treat others. Matching offerings - Sales is much less about techniques. Focus on the value you offer. - Sales is an emotional game. - Give goals: give stuff to ppl. - Book of prospecting time and don’t let it move.</p>
<p>2024-05-01</p>
<ul>
<li>If nobody’s following you you’re just out for a walk</li>
<li>Lead with respect. Be others focused.</li>
<li>Take the I out of team. Build incentives to foster teamwork.</li>
<li>Be willing to walk away. This helps increase the value prop.</li>
<li>The most successful people are</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-30</p>
<ul>
<li>problem solving: the customer brings the symptoms but I need to diagnose</li>
<li>How committed is your prospect to getting change?</li>
<li>Four personalities
<ul>
<li>Driver. → get to the point.</li>
<li>Influencer: motivated by status</li>
<li>Steady Relaters: loyal. More methodological. → build a relationship. Avoids conflict. Prioritize relationship.</li>
<li>cautious thinker → they have analysis paralysis. Long decision process. → have delayed gratification.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Clarify expectations. - Be clear. - Be assertive. - Make commitments.</p>
<p>Review how you interact with different personality styles</p>
<p>Have a truth telling convo with yourself - Why do you feel you’re not hitting your goals? - Check your assertiveness</p>
<p>How well do you make decisions? - if you’re not good at making decisions, you can’t expect your customers to make decisions</p>
<p>Agree and align: - find the truth. - Ask questions of inquiry <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> and <a href="../book-review/feeling-good-together.html">Feeling Good Together</a> - <a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> → agree with people. Get them to like you.</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<ul>
<li>People do business with people they like</li>
<li>Ask more talk less.</li>
<li>Three questions:
<ul>
<li>Why is this a problem?</li>
<li>What is it costing you right now?</li>
<li>What is it going to cost you if you don’t solve it?
<ul>
<li>Are your competitors figuring it out?</li>
<li>Will someone be fired?</li>
<li>Business dry up?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 2 - slow down. Build partnership. - <a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> - be deeply interested in others. - Each day focus on improving. - Stress tolerance: all this competition/recession will get rid of our competitors. - Top sales: create opportunities. - Humor to relieve stress. - People buy emotionally, Not logically</p>
<p>Make a decision - What are you doing? You need to focus.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 - price to value. Sell the value, not the price.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rat brains → if you introduce intermittent reward, rats can push the button 1,000 times.
<ul>
<li>Slot machines: help win every 5-10. Then progressively slow it down over time until the person is empty. It’s manipulation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Habit: cue, routine, reward. <a href="../book-review/the-power-of-habit.html">The Power of Habit</a>. Keep the cue and reward equivalent, change the routine. Practice in your mind</li>
<li>Every victory is a mix of work and luck. Seek truth.
<ul>
<li>Self-serving bias: they messed up, I did great. I would have won every tournament if it weren’t for luck</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we’re more likely to reshape our perspective of the situation to have it conform to our own beliefs rather than accept the truth. #LossAversion <a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></li>
<li>Wanna bet on it? → forces you to think. If I say “I’m 60% confident citizen Kane won best picture”, it forces you to think why 60%. What’s 6/10? Perhaps - 6 times out of ten my gut gets such a thing right.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-04-29</p>
<ul>
<li>reactive vs deliberative brain.</li>
<li>Losses feels 2x as bad as wins. Losses are not costs.</li>
<li>I’m not sure → if there’s a 24% chance then that’s one of the 24/100 possible outcomes. And it happened.</li>
<li>Scale: 0 to 500. → really bad scale.</li>
<li>Life is more like poker than chess. Poker: you can do the best thing but there are so many things out of your control. Novices can win. Luck.
<ul>
<li>→ Ecclesiaates.</li>

  <title>I’m Grateful for A change in perspective</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/a-change-in-perspective.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tonight there was a moment in my day where I wanted to change my perspective. For me, prayer is a helpful tool in changing my perspective. I believe God helps those who seek His help.</p>
<p>And I had a crazy experience with food poisoning a few days ago that, because I said a prayer, helped me turn it into something good.</p>
<p>Perhaps this can be a recurring prayer: make this challenge be for my benefit.</p>
<p>I’m grateful God loves His children and answers prayers.</p>

  <title>What’s my Foundation Model?</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/whats-my-foundation-model.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Thinking on <a href="../christianity/a-foundation-on-christ.html">A foundation on Christ</a>, I wondered: what is my “foundation model?”</p>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>In machine learning there’s all this talk of foundation models. If you have a bad foundation model, you can’t build good software.</p>
<p>Likewise, the quality of a prediction system is in the data. And in the model. And upon that I can build a system.</p>
<p>And the quality of my testimony is based on how much I put Christ as my guide, inspiration, and foundation.</p>

  <title>A foundation on Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/a-foundation-on-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Today in Sunday school we studied Helaman 5:12:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall. <a href="../scriptures/helaman-5.12">Helaman 5.12</a></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>In reading <a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>, a big section is dedicated to the tale of two selves: the experiencing self and the remembering self.</p>
<p>The peak-end bias is that despite enjoying several hours or years of an experience, we only remember the high and the end. This happens in movies - if you don’t like how it ends you hate the movie. If you don’t like the bill you won’t remember the food you just ate.</p>
<p>I was sick this week, laying on the ground unable to move much with some food poisoning. I said a prayer to have a positive experience, or to learn something. And I did! While sick I was just impressed at how my body was able to instinctively know what to do to fight the illness.</p>
<p>And now I look back and I’m almost glad I had that experience. It taught me some important things.</p>
<p>That’s the power I’ve felt of building a foundation on Christ. When I’m challenged, I know I can seek the Lord (it’s easier to remember this with a physical sickness than many other things in life). And when I do, He both helps the experiencing self and the remembering self. He consecrates those experiences for our good <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9.html">2-nephi-32.9</a> .</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He will consecrate both hard and good things for our good.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for The Temple</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-temple.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tonight I went to the temple.</p>
<p>Inside every temple is a feeling of calm and peace. The people inside are all there to focus and learn about the Savior, which invokes a quiet reverence for the duration of the visit.</p>
<p>Today I came away reminded of the power of prayer. I’m grateful for the temple and the peace I feel inside.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Kids out in the field playing. Half of them picking their nose. Half the parents too. The grass is green. The hills are somehow greener. The sun peeking through the clouds. The batter who bunts on a full swing.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for America.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for A small, insignificant corner of the internet</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/a-small-insignificant-corner-of-the-internet.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As I’m perusing LinkedIn today, I see comments from past colleagues. It’s quite incredible to be able to connect in this way.</p>
<p>But also incredibly unnatural, from the long-standing view of humanity.</p>
<p>Humanity has always been about connecting people. Writing letters. Going on walks. Standing in the town square to share your message.</p>
<p>The internet is now the town square. And humans are manipulating the robots that command our attention. All social media sites optimize for time spent on their platform. More eyeballs.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s exhausting and addictive to continue to scroll.</p>
<p>Today, I’m grateful I don’t have to keep scrolling. I have a life to live.</p>

<p>The first thing I saw was 10 kids piling onto a loose ball. It was exactly the chaos I’d hope for.</p>
<p>I look around. I see beautiful green hills. I see parents cheering on their kids. I see kids having fun.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure other things could make me happier than being in a beautiful place with the people I love.</p>

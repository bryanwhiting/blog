<p>Nephi sees what happens to his people 600 years into the future. They suffer a lot, and are almost destroyed.</p>

<p>But the Son of Righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-26.9">2 Nephi 26.9</a></p>

<p>The Savior heals. He is the One Who Comes. Who has come. Who will come.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter anymore to me <em>when</em> he’ll return. Just <em>that</em> he’s retuning. This is a beautiful perspective.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for A sleeping baby</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/a-sleeping-baby.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Every night I put my daughter down to bed. It’s a sweet moment. She lays helplessly in my arms. I helplessly hold her.</p>
<p>Babies come into the world with so much trust. Trust I’ll do right by her.</p>
<p>And seeing her sleep is the best part.</p>

  <title>The 6 Types of Working Genius</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>about 70% of an instructive story and 30% the true content. The story is really cringe/cheesy but helps introduce the ideas.</li>
<li>Back 30% presents the concrete definitions. It lays out how a team can truly work together as a team to complement each other’s strengths.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shortform.com/blog/the-6-types-of-working-genius/">The 6 Types of Working Genius: Book Overview | Shortform Books</a></p>
<p>We all have things that either energize or drain us. If we’re aware, we can complement each other.</p>
<p>Three phases of work/a task: ideation, activation, and implementation. Each task requires two types of genius.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideation
<ul>
<li>Wonder: Ask why? Ask “is there a better way?”</li>
<li>Innovation: figure out solutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Activation
<ul>
<li>Discernment: use intuition and judgment in figuring out good/bad ideas</li>
<li>Galvanize/rally people/buy-in</li>
</ul></li>
<li>implementation
<ul>
<li>Enable: volunteer. Help people. Empower.</li>
<li>Tenacity: cross the finish line. Execute. Pound obstacles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Six type of genius more concretely defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wonder: Involved the ability to ponder, speculate, and question the state of things. Asking the questions that provoke answer and action. People with this genius are naturally inclined to do these things, to lose themselves in observing the world around them and wondering if things shouldn’t be different or untapped potential that should be tapped.</li>
<li>Innovation: come up with new ideas or solutions. They’re drawn to origination, creativity and ingenuity, even with little context or directions. Though every type is a genius, these are the people who are most often referred to as geniuses because many of their ideas seem to come out of thin air.</li>
<li>Discernment: related to sanctity, intuition, and uncanny judgment. People with this genius have the natural ability to assess an idea or situation even without a lot of data or expertises. Using pattern recognition and gut feel they’re able to provide valuable advice and feedback around most subjects in a way that transcends their levels of specific knowledge or information.</li>
<li>Galvanizing: is about rallying, motivating, or provoking people to take action around an idea or an initiative. People with this genius are naturally inclined to inspire or enlist people to get involved in an endeavor. They don’t mind persuading people to rethink or change their plans to embark on something worthwhile.</li>
<li>Enabling: providing people with support and assistance in a way that it is needed. People with this genius are adept at responding to the needs of others without conditions or restrictions. They’re naturally inclined to help others accomplish their goals and can often anticipate what people might need before they ask. Individuals with this genius are frequently unaware that this is a genius at all.</li>
<li>Tenacity: is about the satisfaction of pushing things across the finish line to completion. They’re not only capable of and naturally inclined to finish projects to ensure they’re completed to specification. They gain energy by pushing through obstacles and seeing the impact of their work and they find joy from crossing tasks off their list and getting closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Categories of genius - each person has two geniuses, two competencies, and two frustrations. (Per their research)</p>
<ul>
<li>Genius: it energizes you. Joy, energy, and passion.</li>
<li>Competency: it neither energizes nor drains you. Can do fairly well. But we will eventually grow weary if we can do our geniuses.</li>
<li>Frustration: it drains you. Struggle. Hate it. You can spent a ton of time here without getting to burnout, or failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Genius activation modes: you’ll probably have two responsive and two disruptive geniuses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive: respond to an external stimulus to be put into action. Need to be activated by an event.</li>
<li>Disruptive: initiate or provoke change when they see a need for it. More proactive.</li>
</ul>

<li>People have always wanted to forecast, such as ancients using the shape of sheep liver to predict the future. Tarot cards, prophets, etc have been religious and spiritual forecasters.</li>
<li>Forecasting has always been a guessing game.</li>
<li>Sometimes you can use algorithms to mine historical data for forecasting, but that assumes the future will be like the past.</li>

<p><a href="../book-review/beyond-band-of-brothers.html">Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters</a></p>
<p>Leadership from the bayonette. 10 points of leadership by dick winters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strive to be a leader of character, competence, and courage.</li>
<li>Lead from the front. Say, “Follow me!” and then lead the way.</li>
<li>Stay in top physical shape—physical stamina is the root of mental toughness.</li>
<li>Develop your team. If you know your people, are fair in setting realistic goals and expectations, and lead by example, you will develop teamwork.</li>
<li>Delegate responsibility to your subordinates and let them do their jobs. You can’t do a good job if you don’t have a chance to use your imagination or your creativity.</li>
<li>Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don’t wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind.</li>
<li>Remain humble. Don’t worry about who receives the credit. Never let power or authority go to your head.</li>
<li>Take a moment of self-reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself if you did your best.</li>
<li>True satisfaction comes from getting the job done. The key to a successful leader is to earn respect—not because of rank or position, but because you are a leader of character.</li>
<li>Hang tough!—Never, ever give up.</li>

  <title>2 Nephi 25 - We Talk of Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-25-talk-of-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>There is one purpose of a law: to prevent something. Or to ensure something happens. But you really can’t prevent bad things from happening by creating a law because laws are just rules. They define what’s bad.</p>
<p>Consider the law of Moses. It defined what was bad. The Ten Commandments. The ordinances. The many rituals and performances.</p>
<p>But the law was dead.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-25.24">2 Nephi 25.24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the <strong>law hath become dead</strong> unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments. 26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-25.25-26">2 Nephi 25.25–26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forgetting even the spirit of the law, we can just focus on Christ. Just men need no law. # Meaning</p>
<p>The goal of following Christ isn’t to follow him. It’s to become like him. To experience what He experienced. To feel what He felt. The law is dead once you know that and pursue that.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Sun on turf</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/sun-on-turf.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Growing up I played a lot of sports, namely football and lacrosse. One of the best things about playing lacrosse was that it happened in the spring, as the snow was melting and the town warming.</p>
<p>When it was cold in the early season, players would lay close to the artificial turf. It was soft, and retained the heat of the sun. It was sometimes the best way to warm up.</p>
<p>I think of that warmth when I lay in my backyard.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New Job</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I began a new job. It’s a new opportunity to get to know people, to build relationships, and to learn. It’s a chance to change, adapt, and develop.</p>
<p>Each company is its own little world, proving that there’s no one right way to build a business. There are millions of ways.</p>
<p>That’s cool.</p>

  <title>A Costly Mistake</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/a-costly-mistake.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“This is the moment I’ve been waiting for”…until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Several years ago as a budding data scientist I got excited by using a massive compute cluster. This is it. This is when I get to do Big Data Science, baby!</p>
<p>A few thousand dollars later, I realized my hundred-dollar-an-hour cluster wasn’t doing the thing I hired it to do.</p>
<p>My patient manager David Mantilla ssh’d into my cluster and discovered that out of the 64 cores I paid for, I was using only 1.</p>
<p>A good manager goes a long way. He just laughed as I stared in horror at my gross misconduct.</p>
<p>Be kind to the noobs. Because you still are one in many ways…</p>

<p>I lay on the couch, having finished my taxes. My eyes get heavy. The kids are at peace. My wife asks, “are you going to fall asleep?”</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The eyes get heavy as the blanket warms up. The long stretch of the sectional welcomes me to fulfill its purpose.</p>
<p>And then it’s gone. Before it’s even been fully enjoyed…</p>

  <title>Mere Christianity</title>
  <dc:creator>C.S. Lewis</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/mere-christianity.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<ul>
<li>Cs Lewis didn’t listen to his friends</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-10</p>
<ul>
<li>Good people know about good and evil, the way a sober person clearly understands a drunk.</li>
<li>Giving charitably. Give more than you can, sacrificing some things for it.</li>
<li>I love the theology he thinks through, such as repentance and such. But he also delves specifically into doctrines like saying whether sexual perversion is worse or better than being a nice person to someone else. Perhaps this is the content Tolkien wished he had left to clergy people. <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a></li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-03</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote <a href="../christianity/2024-03-03-my-testimony.html">My Testimony</a> today without having read this book - cool to see we both had the same logic on “math” and “law of nature”.</li>
<li>I love his “unseen hand” or “to compare something as moral or immoral you must do it against some standard”</li>
<li>When speaking you can use inflection. When writing, you shouldn’t use italics because there are better ways of emphasizing the point. Ways you might not be able to employ with just writing.</li>

<p>I’m grateful for Easter. I’m grateful for the knowledge of a Savior. That He died, and rose from the dead. That He lives.</p>
<p>A belief in Jesus is a belief in quite a number of wonderful things:</p>
<ul>
<li>All people will live eternally. We will all get bodies because of Him.</li>
<li>Death is not the end, but just another step in an everlasting life</li>
<li>Sickness and pain is only temporary. In the hereafter there are joys untold awaiting us.</li>
<li>A God is willing to die for us. We are worth His love. His sacrifice. Each one of us.</li>
<li>There is unimaginable power in this universe that we can’t imagine even tapping. Who on earth can raise the dead? Not even the most brilliant doctor. But for Christ, it’s what He will do.</li>
<li>Families and beloved relationships will perpetuate beyond the grave.</li>
<li>There is always hope even in the darkest days. Christ was among an oppressed people. He was rejected by those he came to serve. He was crucified. But then he rose from the dead and it was finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are even many more blessings.</p>

  <title>Ibis DataFrames for Python, why I hate Pandas, and what I miss about dplyr</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/ibis-dataframes-for-python-vs-pandas.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I haven’t used <code>ibis</code> as of writing this. Just reviewed the docs.</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="data-manipulation-in-python" class="level1">
<h1>Data Manipulation in Python</h1>
<p>I’ve been a Python data scientist for 5-6 years. I’ve never liked pandas. Ever.</p>
<p>It’s because I started as a <code>tidyverse</code> data scientist in R. One of the things I’ve missed about using Python is <code>dplyr</code>, an R package for data manipulation. And when I started with Python it was in PySpark - it felt very similar to <code>dplyr</code>, except for the annoying JVM.</p>
<p>It’s amazing because everything is done by chaining, and it’s able to manipulate in memory or translate to a spark or SQL backend for execution. (It’s very easy to use base <code>dplyr</code> and then just run the same query in memory on a small dataframe or against <code>BigQuery</code> or something.)</p>
<p>This chaining also avoids the common readability problem with pandas wherein often you see df[x] = df[y] / df[b] on one line and that’s repeated for multiple lines if you want to create multiple new variables.</p>
<p>While <code>pandas</code> has the .pipe and .assign operators for chaining, they still require lambda functions, which get annoying. This Reddit thread explores the opinion I share: the api is inconsistent. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/146rj9m/does_anyone_else_hate_pandas/">Reddit - Does anyone else hate pandas?</a>.</p>
<p><code>Polars</code> makes this much cleaner with the with_columns operator, for example, which is also very similar to <code>PySpark</code>. But <code>polars</code> is Rust backend, not Java. Game, Set, Match <code>polars</code>.</p>
<p>I’m not the only one who loves <code>dplyr</code> . There have been several Python attempts to build <code>dplyr</code> in the Python ecosystem. There were great packages like <a href="https://github.com/coursera/pandas-ply">GitHub - coursera/pandas-ply: functional data manipulation for pandas</a> (9 years since last commit), and <a href="https://github.com/dodger487/dplython">GitHub - dodger487/dplython: dplyr for python</a>, not updated in 7 years. Then there’s the <code>dfply</code> <a href="https://github.com/kieferk/dfply">package</a> that hasn’t been maintained in 5 years (see <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/dplyr-style-data-manipulation-with-pipes-in-python-380dcb137000">tutorial</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>siuba</code> package is the latest Python <code>dplyr</code> incantation that is actively maintained: <a href="https://github.com/machow/siuba">GitHub - machow/siuba: Python library for using dplyr like syntax with pandas and SQL</a> and can also execute against a SQL backend, but it can’t execute a polars backend. # Ibis to solve my problems?</p>
<p>I just came across <code>ibis</code> however, and it seems really promising. Turns out it was <a href="https://ibis-project.org/concepts/who">created</a> in 2015 by Wes McKinney to solve the <a href="https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/">“10 Things I Hate About pandas”</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ibis-project.org/">Ibis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ibis-project.org/tutorials/getting_started">Ibis – getting_started</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ibis-project.org/posts/wow-analysis/">Ibis – Analysis of World of Warcraft data</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-ibis-data.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid"></p>
<p>It looks like <code>dplyr</code> (for example it even copies some syntax like mutate() for adding new columns and select for picking columns). But, the benefit is it has <code>polars</code> and <code>pandas</code> as backends, but also offers <code>PySpark</code> (should someon need to use databricks as a backend compute engine). And it can also translate into SQL. Sure, polars can do this too: <a href="https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/io/database/">Databases - Polars user guide</a>. But <code>ibis</code> seems more extensive.</p>
<p>This means I could have one programming language to execute either <code>polars</code>, SQL, or PySpark, rather than have both <code>polars</code> and SQL or <code>pandas</code> in my pipeline in different places. (Side note: why would I use <code>pandas</code> as a backend though when <code>polars</code> is so fast?)</p>
<p>I just discovered this over the weekend. Would love your thoughts! I’m sure there are limitations vs raw polars/pandas that are hidden from my quick overview.</p>
</section>
<section id="appendix" class="level1">
<h1>Appendix</h1>
<p>The most annoying thing about <code>pandas</code> is the <code>.transform()</code> operator. I hate it. Just hate it. It never makes sense and I always have to look it up. This essentially just does a window operation.</p>
<p>You don’t need this until you need to do some type of aggregation within a group. Let’s assume you want to calculate the fraction of sales attributed to a city within a state. (What fraction of sales in California come from San Francisco, for example.)</p>
<p>Read the following and consider for yourself what’s simplest:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'State': ['CA', 'CA', 'CA', 'NY', 'NY', 'NY'],
    'City': ['SF', 'LA', 'SF', 'NYC', 'Buffalo', 'NYC'],
    'Sales': [100, 200, 150, 300, 100, 200]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state
df['Fraction'] = df.groupby('State')['Sales'].apply(lambda x: x / x.sum())

print(df)</code></pre>
<p>Polars:</p>
<pre><code>import polars as pl

df = pl.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state
df = df.with_column(
  pl.col('Sales') / df.groupby('State').agg(pl.sum('Sales'))['sum'])

print(df)</code></pre>
<p>Dplyr:</p>
<pre><code>library(dplyr)

# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state
df &lt;- data %&gt;%
  group_by(State) %&gt;%
  mutate(Fraction = Sales / sum(Sales))</code></pre>
<p>Ibis:</p>
<pre><code>import ibis

# Calculate fraction of sales by city within state
expr = sales.mutate(Fraction=sales['Sales'] / sales.groupby('State').Sales.sum())

result = expr.execute()
print(result)</code></pre>
<p>It may not look all that different, but pandas has this weird syntax where you group by (something) but then select a column with brackets. But sometimes you can use periods to select the column.</p>
<p>The polars and ibis implementations seem simple, but overly verbose.</p>
<p>Then there’s the <code>dplyr</code>. So elegant and simple. The <code>sum()</code> operator is summing within the group, and the <code>sales/sum(sales)</code> is very easy to read.</p>
<p>In pandas I’m left wondering what is <code>x/x.sum()</code> and why this <code>lambda</code> thing?</p>
<p>This is a very simple example, but the more you get into the weeds the more my point becomes obvious.</p>
<p>The benefits of <code>dplyr</code> come from when you want to do 10 mutates in one go. It’s so simple. In pandas that’s 10 lambda functions with a .assign operator.</p>
<p>Like, look at <code>pandas</code> trying to do this:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'A': list(range(1, 11)),
    'B': list(range(11, 21)),
    'C': list(range(21, 31))
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Using assign to create 10 new columns
df = df.assign(
    # New columns with various transformations
    A_Squared=lambda x: x['A']**2,
    B_Squared=lambda x: x['B']**2,
    C_Squared=lambda x: x['C']**2,
    A_Cubed=lambda x: x['A']**3,
    B_Cubed=lambda x: x['B']**3,
    C_Cubed=lambda x: x['C']**3,
    A_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['A']),
    B_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['B']),
    C_Log=lambda x: np.log(x['C']),
    A_B=lambda x: x['A'] * x['B']
)

print(df)</code></pre>
<p>Now look at <code>dplyr</code>:</p>
<pre><code>library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data &lt;- data.frame(
  A = 1:10,
  B = 11:20,
  C = 21:30
)

# Using mutate to create 10 new columns
df &lt;- data %&gt;%
  mutate(
    # New columns with various transformations
    A_Squared = A^2,
    B_Squared = B^2,
    C_Squared = C^2,
    A_Cubed = A^3,
    B_Cubed = B^3,
    C_Cubed = C^3,
    A_Log = log(A),
    B_Log = log(B),
    C_Log = log(C),
    A_B = A * B
  )

print(df)</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s complicate it, where each manipulation takes in a previous column:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})

# Mutate operations
df['B'] = df['A'] ** 2
df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B'] * 2
df['D'] = df['B'] / 2
df['E'] = df['C'] - df['A']
df['F'] = df['A'] * 5
df['G'] = df['D'] - df['E']
df['H'] = df['F'] + df['G']
df['I'] = df['D'] ** 2
df['J'] = df['H'] / df['I']
df['K'] = df['I'] - df['J']

print(df)</code></pre>
<p>This is how most people write pandas. They write <code>df</code> 26 times.</p>
<p>Let’s look at pandas using the <code>assign</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})

# Mutate operations with assign and lambda functions
df = df.assign(
    B=lambda x: x['A'] ** 2,
    C=lambda x: x['A'] + x['B'] * 2,
    D=lambda x: x['B'] / 2,
    E=lambda x: x['C'] - x['A'],
    F=lambda x: x['A'] * 5,
    G=lambda x: x['D'] - x['E'],
    H=lambda x: x['F'] + x['G'],
    I=lambda x: x['D'] ** 2,
    J=lambda x: x['H'] / x['I'],
    K=lambda x: x['I'] - x['J']
)

print(df)</code></pre>
<p>Slightly better but still an eyesore. 10 lambda statements and still 26 <code>x</code> calls.</p>
<p>And in R:</p>
<pre><code>library(dplyr)

# Create a tibble
df &lt;- tibble(A = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))

# Mutate operations
df &lt;- df %&gt;%
  mutate(B = A ^ 2,
         C = A + B * 2,
         D = B / 2,
         E = C - A,
         F = A * 5,
         G = D - E,
         H = F + G,
         I = D ^ 2,
         J = H / I,
         K = I - J)

print(df)</code></pre>
<p>It’s just so simple. So elegant. So beautiful. No wasted text. Very easy to read.</p>
<p>Ibis seems similar to dplyr but requires the <code>D = _.["B"]/2</code> operation. <a href="https://ibis-project.org/tutorials/cloud-data-platforms/starburst-galaxy/1_basics.html#mutating-columns">Ibis – basics - mutating columns</a></p>

  <title>Easter, the most important holiday</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/easter-the-most-important-holiday.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today is #Easter, the most important holiday of the year for Christians, and perhaps the most radical and profound holiday for the world. It shows the most #inclusive</p>
<p>On this day, nearly 2,000 years ago, it is believed that Jesus Christ, considered the Son of God, resurrected from the tomb. He was the first to rise from the dead, and then gave power to others to resurrect.</p>
<p>Consider the hope this offers. Death is only momentary. Everlasting life awaits for us all.</p>
<p>Here’s what Jesus did that was incredibly kind, selfless and #inclusive:</p>
<ul>
<li>He first appeared to Mary, a woman. He frequently “broke the rules” by spending time with those society marginalized, and forgiving the sins of people worthy of death.</li>
<li>He told his followers to share His gospel with the world. It was no longer restricted to just the Israelites (of which Jews are one of twelve houses)</li>
<li>He shared the gospel with the dead, who live as spirits on the other side. He freed the captive spirits.</li>
</ul>
<p>#DEI #Diversity</p>

<p>It’s hard to fathom how pretty these hills are. I see them every morning as I drive from my house. I see them in the distance. But their full beauty isn’t appreciated until my feet climb.</p>
<p>There’s something about being in the valley that causes me to think I know what’s up there. I’ve also been up there many times.</p>
<p>But the reality is it’s just its own thing. I gotta go see it to believe it. And it’s really worth believing.</p>

<ul>
<li>emotional work is hard work. Emotionally immature people feel like they don’t need</li>
<li>Roles are sacred to emotional immature people: role of parent.</li>
<li>Kids feel like they have to help solve their parents emotional problems but they can’t.</li>
<li>They seek enmeshment, not intimacy</li>
<li>emotional parents</li>
<li>Driven parents</li>
<li>passive parwnts</li>
<li>healing dreams. Creates roles. Role-self vs true self. “If only I…” is a coping mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-30</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t see their role in your problems.</li>
<li>don’t tell you about stuff.</li>
<li>Self referential vs self reflective</li>
<li>Expressing feelings wasn’t condoned or supported.</li>
<li>Crying stops when given emotional support. “I’ll give you something to cry about”</li>
<li>Focuses on facts and dive deep in intellectual topics but not emotions</li>
<li>Overemphasize physical health → we can feel as children a bond to those who took physical care of us but not emotional.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Mindfulness is a state of mind. But being present with one’s body is another matter.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/heal-your-nervous-system.html">Heal Your Nervous System</a> has been interesting as I’ve learned about additional senses beyond the five we commonly know. Certainly, meditating has had experiences for me that have been floaty feelings or what not.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’ve had these experiences and know what they are.</p>

  <title>Easter Study: Seek Miracles</title>

<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the same way, the Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, “doubting nothing.” Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith. I promise that you can experience for yourself that Jesus Christ “giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.” Few things will accelerate your spiritual momentum more than realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life. <a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-the-power-of-spiritual-momentum">“The Power of Spiritual Momentum”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Reading this gives me pause. I have always thought not to seek for signs. “A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh signs” or what not. But this is different. This is seeking miracles, which is the Lord’s hand in our life.</p>
<p>If I seek a miracle, I seek Jesus’ hand in my life. His healing. His advice. His teachings. Those are and were His miracles.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Fairy Houses</title>

<p>This is a fairy house:</p>

<p>It took us hours to build, and I’m not sure where the idea came from, but we each took time building something for the house. There’s an A frame, a Bon fire, a ladder, a circle swing. And most importantly: a door to the fire pit.</p>
<p>My wife commented, “I kinda wanna go out and play out there.”</p>
<p>It’s magical. It was a special time to work on this memory with our kids. I’m grateful for these moments that parenting provides. I don’t know when else it’d be so exciting to hit glue some sticks together. But it was.</p>

  <title>On file formats: parquet vs csv</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/on-file-formats-parquet-vs-csv.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Came across this article today: <a href="https://kaveland.no/friends-dont-let-friends-export-to-csv.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Robin’s blog – Friends don’t let friends export to CSV</a></p>
<p>This has largely been my experience too: go with the file format that’s fast reading in and out.</p>
<p>It’s rare a data scientist with open a file on their computer rather than just <code>pd.read_*()</code> it in.</p>
<p>In my last job, we were using <code>jsonl</code> files for no other reason than it how one person liked to use command line tools to analyze it.</p>
<p>But if you’re using command line tools to inspect a data file, and not just a Python repl, you’ve already gone down the wrong direction IMO. But what if you’re on a remote server and don’t have pandas installed? Yea, that’s not something you should plan for. At that point, just scp the file to a place you can read it.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Ever Shifting Tides</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ever-shifting-tides.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The tech industry is pretty crazy. I was just watching some keynote talks from Nvidia and if they actually land half of the stuff they’re talking about, they’re going to just plow the world in a new direction.</p>
<p>I watch it and probably feel both awe and fear. What will the future look like? And will I do anything that cool? I kind of look at my little bag of talents and wonder how I fit into this big world.</p>
<p>But I do. I do fit in. I’m a part of that tide of shifting technology, of pushing the boundaries forward. I’m grateful for a job in tech. It isn’t easy. But it’s rewarding. It’s changing people’s lives.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Better Health</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/better-health.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Having the flu stinks. I realized quickly this week how a life revolves around health. My ability to do my job, to be there for my family, and even enjoy sitting on the couch is all impacted by what’s going on inside my body.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is: when I’m sick, I only want to get better and I realize what’s most important. But as I get better, my mind focuses in equal proportion on the normal preoccupations of life and I perhaps focus less on the things I had just realized were most important.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for good health.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for CS Lewis</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/cs-lewis.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Probably and odd thing to be thankful for, but I’m grateful for this guy’s legacy. Having read <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> I decided to read <a href="../book-review/mere-christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve read a few things by Lewis and have enjoyed his writing. It’s also fun to better imagine him writing it when he was at Oxford in 1940’s.</p>
<p>His writing continues to influence millions. I’m grateful he chose to write what he did even though people around him didn’t want him to.</p>

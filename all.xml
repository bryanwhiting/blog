  <title>Handling Outliers in Linear Regression</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/handling-outliers-in-linear-regression.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>So you have an outlier in your data. How do you handle it?</p>
<section id="three-ways-to-handle-an-outlier" class="level1">
<h1>Three Ways to Handle an Outlier</h1>
<p>Well, you can either include it or drop it from your data. If you include it, it may bias your regression coefficient.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you have some data where you have X = Emails Sent and Y = Sales. You want to know the effect of email on sales.</p>
<p>You have at least three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: fit the model on 100% if data, and don’t account for the outlier.</li>
<li>B: Create a dummy variable that’s 1 for outlier and 0 otherwise.</li>
<li>C: drop the outlier from your data and fit without a special feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that options B and C are identical in their predictions for non-outlier time periods. Effectively, you isolate the effect of those outliers when you create a dummy variable for them. Let’s take a look.</p>
</section>
<section id="scenario-1-outlier-with-constant-effect" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scenario 1: Outlier with constant effect</h1>
<p>Here we have some sales data over time. You can see the outliers here are all relatively equally high:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-outlier-sales-only.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Sales</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now I’m going to fit a model as above and get the “fitted values”, or in-sample predictions. We can see from this that the A model (no outlier treatment) has a higher line. This is the effect of the outlier on the slope. But the B model fits the data near perfectly. You’ll notice the C model and the B model are perfectly overlapping except for the gap on C (remember we dropped rows, so we didn’t have in-sample fitted values there!)</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-in-sample.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">In sample predictions</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now, the model B is Y = intercept + email + is_holiday Boolean. If you make a prediction assuming is_holiday = 0 then you get the green line. This is the effect of making a prediction of what your sales would have been if it wasn’t a holiday. This is one way to get a “baseline”. Then the blue line is the predicted value with holiday = 1. The gap between blue and green is the effect of your holiday (I could show the model coefficients but I’m lazy!)</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-fitted-and-non-fitted.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Fitted and non-fitted B values</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Okay, last interesting bit: what would the prediction of the model C be during this holiday period? Remember, we don’t have in-sample predictions (fitted values) because we dropped those rows. So technically, this middle spot is “out of sample” for model C.</p>
<p>What do we see? Well since the slope for “email” is the same for model C and B, the predictions are near identical. Let’s add in the model C non-fitted line:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-model-c-out-of-sample.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Predicting model C out of sample</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What do we see? We see that model C (purple line) overlaps the green line perfectly.</p>
<p>So per this simple example, there are two ways of handling an outlier:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop it from your data (not ideal)</li>
<li>Use feature engineering to handle it (ideal)</li>
</ol>
<p>In a more complicated setting, there are tons of real world interactions in your data that make this even more complicated. But with good feature engineering you can isolate the effect of those outliers or subgroups.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. As always, always test the principle on your own data before fully trusting this principle. There may be something specific about your data or your model where this may not apply exactly (such as using decision trees or a GLM or GAM).</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s a beautiful world. You can ask ChatGPT to code up these analyses really quickly. Do you have a debate at work? Ask ChatGPT to run a simulation.</p>
</section>
<section id="scenario-2-variable-impact-outlier" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scenario 2: Variable impact outlier</h1>
<p>In this scenario, we assume that the outliers are unpredictably spikey. Some days are more spikey than others. This might be representative of a holiday period where a few days are on the weekend.</p>
<p>We see again that our principle holds: the regression coefficient is largely the same.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-charts-sales-scenario-2.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">When you have non-stationary outliers</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="scenario-3-massively-spiky-outliers" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scenario 3: Massively Spiky outliers</h1>
<p>Now what if you have a holiday period AND a massive one-day spike (Black Friday)?</p>
<p>Here’s what the model predictions look like in green. <img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-3-massive-spike.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Massive spike"></p>
<p>And this is where we start to see the Model C predictions (drop outliers) differ from model B:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chart-sales-massive-spike-3-compare-close-up.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Dropping has different results than retaining</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The predictions can differ by 10% or more. This means the coefficients can be wildly different, and that’s what we see. Model B’s email coefficient was 2.0 compared to just 1.1 for C. (Remember the model is <code>y ~ emails (+ holiday)</code>).</p>
<p>How do we solve this problem? Back to Scenario 1 - more feature engineering and interactions. # In Conclusion</p>
<p>Feature engineering has a huge impact on your model’s ability to make good predictions. Also, it affects the interpret ability of your model coefficients, which may be valuable in gaining insights from your data (such as what is the causal effect of email on revenue).</p>
<p>When you drop a row of data, you’re essentially creating a new model. And you’re implicitly targeting that row. You’re doing a type of feature engineering.</p>
<p>The better thing to do is to actually just do the feature engineering, because you’ll be able to generalize to similar data points like that in the future. # Other Ways to Handle Outliers</p>
<p>In this DoorDash blog, they provide a unique solution for XGBoost, mostly because XGBoost has a hard time extrapolating. But there are other ways to handle your data.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Shake off the Chains</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-shake-off-the-chains.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Keeping the commandments brings blessings:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.20">2 Nephi 1.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it. Keeping the commandments means being honest, being kind, being respectful, finding a way to help others. Not being lazy. Being productive.</p>
<p>Literally, nobody can prosper without keeping some commandment. Without finding a way to meet someone’s need.</p>
<p>I also like this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.23">2 Nephi 1.23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a rallying cry we can all relate to. We are all bound with chains in life. But we don’t have to be. The call to “rise up” is a call to shake the chains to hold you bound. Arise from the dust!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-breaking-free-from-the-chains.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Break free from the chains"> # Meaning</p>
<p>It makes me wonder: what are the chains that hold me bound? Perhaps there are limiting beliefs.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New York</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-york.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Since I was a kid, going to the city was a quarterly event. Whether going to the Bronx Zoo or the Met for a class field trip or a Yankees game, the city was always an adventure. As I grew up, it’d be the place to go to shows and concerts and visit family members who lived there.</p>
<p>Then when I was 22, I spent a summer as an intern there. Living in the city taught me what it means to be in the city.</p>
<p>From a guy who’d come up to help me with something on the Subway, to the lady who gave me some of her loose change to take the cross town bus, I was humbled by how people there look after each other. It’s hard to notice when the people are tough on the surface. But deep down they care for each other.</p>
<p>I’ve been to LA, and lived near SF, and DC and nothing compares to “city”.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/">Galileo AI</a>. It lets you mock up UI interfaces. Great story in their blog: <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/blog/seed">Galileo AI - Feb 6 Launch Announcement</a></p>
<p>It doesn’t export the code itself, but for a fee it’ll export to Figma for you. The cool thing is they trained or fine tuned an LLM specifically on design components. This is a cool use case of how people with specialized skill sets will create custom LLMs to compete in areas ChatGPT won’t be able to.</p>
<p>This is also showing the emergence in new software: don’t build a rules engine, train an LLM to solve the problem.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Obtaining a Promised Land</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-land-of-promise.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures-a-land-of-promise" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures: A Land of Promise</h1>
<p>I thought about the phrase “land of promise” in <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-2-receiving-a-promised-land.html">1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land</a> and there’s the verse in <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5.html">1 Nephi 5.5</a> where Lehi says “I have obtained a land of promise”. He says that years before arriving in the promised land.</p>
<p>But now, years later, he testifies:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>notwithstanding our afflictions, <strong>we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands</strong>; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.5">2 Nephi 1.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long did it take for them to receive that land? Many years. And many hardships. Lehi complained and was chastised at some point (1 Nephi 16). So the journey isn’t without its struggles.</p>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>The Lord is with us. Even if we complain and struggle, He wants to help us get to a better place, our promised lands.</p>
<p>We can be like Lehi and seek to obtain that personal vision. And receive a personal covenant of how the Lord wants to bless us in our lives.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Kindness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/kindness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been the recipient of a lot of kindness in my life. I know anyone reading this has too. Kindness is a wonderful gift to give someone. It doesn’t cost anything to be kind.</p>
<p>Ways people have been kind to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone called me when they knew I was making a big decision to listen to me.</li>
<li>Parents who showed me how to be kind to each other.</li>
<li>A friend who complemented me.</li>
<li>My wife who goes on dates with me and hangs out with me.</li>
<li>A child who wants to give dad a hug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindness does need to be <em>received</em>, I’ve learned. Kindness can be received when things are going well, as well as when life is tricky, though kindness is probably most poignantly felt and appreciated during hard times. I think that’s a gift: to receive kindness. It’s also a gift to give. Who do you know that could use some kindness today?</p>

  <title>How to share an HTML file (like a quarto output in GitHub)</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/how-to-share-an-html-file-like-a-quarto-output-in-github.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Let’s assume you have a raw HTML file on GitHub, such as a <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-html/">Jupyter notebook you rendered to HTML</a> or a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html">Quarto</a> doc you rendered via <code>quarto render</code>.</p>
<p>If you try to share the link from GitHub directly, GitHub will just show the raw HTML file.</p>
<p>Use this link to convert it to your dashboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/">GitHub &amp; BitBucket HTML Preview</a></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>GitHub File: https://github.com/bryanwhiting/blog/blob/gh-pages/index.html</p>

</div>
<p>Preview using that link: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bryanwhiting/blog/blob/gh-pages/index.html</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Alternative Endings</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-alternative-endings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Lehi and his family were prompted to leave Jerusalem before King Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed it in 586 BCE.</p>
<p>There must be that lingering doubt, when following the Lord, as in “what would life have been like otherwise?”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have seen a vision, in which I know that Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have perished. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.4">2 Nephi 1.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lehi knew the answer: had they stayed they would have perished.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-paradise-vs-destruction.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">What if the alternative to the choices you made was actually a much worse life?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>We hardly ever get to know how it would otherwise have ended. What if you took job A over B? What if I hadn’t broken my wrist? What if I had moved into X house vs.&nbsp;Y - who would I have met?</p>
<p>I’m not sure we’re supposed to know how it could otherwise have turned out. I’m not sure it matters much, either. Because I’m sure there were a lot of good people who weren’t prompted like Lehi to leave. (Consider how Abinadi had to stay.)</p>
<p>So I take this as “that’s interesting.” In this case, Lehi got to know the alternative ending to the story. He got to learn that he had avoided destruction in Jerusalem and could instead finish his days peacefully in his promised land.</p>
<p>We also often compare our lives to how perhaps it could have been better (thanks social media). Do you ever wonder if it could have been worse had you not made that good choice in your life?</p>

  <title>World’s Longest Drive</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There’s a fun $75,000 purse for the winner of the World’s Longest Drive.</p>
<p>These guys are averaging 400y in contest, which is an attempt to drive straight. This guy wins (ofc) but his first round is the best. 432.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gv3YACYV648?si=jXXsfxfHxpmcpHFZ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Apparently the record is 515 set in 1974 by Mike Austin, a 64 year old.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s kind of crazy that since 1974 the record for longest drive hasn’t been broken.</li>
<li>Tech helps, but old school can sometimes be the way. Form over gear all day.</li>
</ol>
<p>But Berkshire broke that record per his Instagram account. Here’s the full scoop:</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Avocados</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/avocados.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“Aguacate, verduras!” It’s a common refrain you hear on the streets of <a href="../concepts/Honduras.html">Honduras</a>.</p>
<p>I first remember being woken up by this loud bark as a vendor walked the street inviting the entire town to enjoy his “avocados, vegetables!!”</p>
<p>I don’t blame him. I, too, want people to enjoy the things I like. And if this guy was selling avocados then I wanted to be buying.</p>
<p>It’s rare that I don’t want avocados on anything. Tonight, I enjoyed them on a hot dog, a classic dish called a “completo” in Chile. Put it on a burger. Put it on a hot dog. It’s like green eggs and ham, I’d eat it on a train, with a fox in a box. Here, there, anywhere.</p>

  <title>Embedding audio in Quarto</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/embedding-audio-in-quarto.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I want to embed just a plain audio file in my blog post.</p>
<p>Check out the post <a href="../creative/guitar-clouds.html">Guitar: Clouds</a>, where I embed some audio using the quarto video short link: <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html">Quarto – Videos</a>.</p>
<p>My process:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a voice recording with my voice notes on iOS.</li>
<li>Save to files, I did audio/ folder (<a href="../posts/quarto-from-phone/index.html">How to blog from your phone using quarto (or hugo/jekyll/etc) using Working Copy and Obsidian</a>)</li>
<li>Then if I link using a standard markdown link it’ll create an audio recording in a new browser. If I use the video shortcode then quarto will embed it as a video right in the post (doesn’t open a new browser). You can adjust the height so it’s not a massive black screen.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
Song snippet today: [2024-02-05-guitar-clouds](../audio/2024-02-05-guitar-clouds.m4a) 3rd capo, G, Em, C, G with some pinky action. 


&lt;-- This works on safari, not chrome desktop for some reason --&gt; 

![2024-02-05-guitar-clouds](../audio/2024-02-05-guitar-clouds.m4a)


</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>
<p>Note, the second way (<code>the ![]</code>) approach didn’t work on Chrome Desktop, but works on Safari desktop, safari mobile, and chrome mobile:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-quarto-audio-chrome-web.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Chrome doesn’t pick up the audio player</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If I inspect the HTML I can see the audio tag is created in Chrome, it’s just not showing a player or anything.</p>
<p>But the mobile audio player is picked up:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-quarto-audio-safari.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Mobile safari</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-chrome-mobile-quarto-audio.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Mobile chrome</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="obsidian" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Obsidian</h1>
<p>I like using this markdown syntax in Obsidian because that’s where I write my notes.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-audio-quarto-not-rendered.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The markdown syntax</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Because it appears like an audio player in app. The <code></code> syntax is a <code>quarto</code> thing and renders nicely. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag is supposed to work but doesn’t in my vault. In my app it looks like this;</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-audio-obsidian-rendered.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Rendered in quarto</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So yes, the markdown link is the most usable, works on most browsers, and works in Obsidian. Just doesn’t work on Chrome Web…(at least not on my version).</p>
<p>Seems also that using the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag breaks my quarto:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/screenshot-audio-tag-breaks-the-file.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Broken file</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="in-summary" class="level1">
<h1>In Summary</h1>
<p>I’ve found two ways of showing audio in quarto. 1) using the image syntax in markdown and 2) using a video shortcode. The markdown syntax works great locally on my iPhone and on most browsers, but the video shortcode seems to work on all browsers.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 22 - His Covenants will be the key of the Gathering of Israel</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-22-gathered-by-his-covenants.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>There is so much doctrine packed in here. Nephi is talking about the Lord doing a “marvelous work”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it [the marvelous work] shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, <strong>unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham</strong>, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, <strong>in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel</strong>. Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they <strong>shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-22.9-12">1 Nephi 22.9–12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will restore His covenants. It doesn’t explicitly say “baptism, the sacrament, the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the endowment, and the sealing ordinance”, but that’s what Nephi is referring to.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-image-wheat-into-a-silo.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The Lord will gather us into His silo. This is His work, not ours.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Why doesn’t the Book of Mormon mention the sealing ordinance? The Melchizedek priesthood (the name of it)? The endowment? I’m not sure. But it’s fascinating how Joseph Smith translated this book but also received revelations to help finalize the structure of the church. # Meaning</p>
<p>This teaches me that…</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord cares about people who reject him. He will do His work among them. He won’t leave me even if I leave Him. That’s a powerful concept.</li>
<li>The covenants are the most important thing to focus on in the scriptures. Everything else is just context about how to best live them.</li>
<li>I am gathered when I keep my covenants. They are the thing that help me understand and connect with the Lord.</li>
</ul>

<h1>There is Divine Discontent in the Consumer Appetite</h1>
<p>Jeff Bezos alluded to the “divinely discontent” customer in a 2017 shareholder letter (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/">Elements of Amazon’s Day 1 Culture | AWS Executive Insights</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly becomes today’s ‘ordinary’. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/Amazon_Shareholder_Letter.pdf">2017 Amazon_Shareholder_Letter.pdf</a></p>

<p>More googling shows the phrase was also used by Neal A Maxwell in 1976 (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng">Notwithstanding My Weakness</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What can we do to manage these vexing feelings of inadequacy? Here are but a few suggestions: (1) We can distinguish more clearly between <strong>divine discontent</strong> and the devil’s dissonance, between dissatisfaction with self and disdain for self. We need the first and must shun the second, remembering that when conscience calls to us from the next ridge, it is not solely to scold but also to beckon.</p>

Many AI tool providers refrain from vendor lock in and try to build LLM agnostic tooling.</p>
<p>How do you compete? Well, most of us aren’t building these foundational models. How do they compete with each other? None of us care. We just want a good one.</p>
<p>But ask yourself, would you rather have Bard from today or nothing from 2022?</p>
<p>These leaderboards are fascinating because in 14 months since ChatGPT emerged we’ve become so reliant on these tools but yet they’re not even old enough to walk or talk by human standards. Yet we now have Bard, ChatGPT, LLaMA, Mistral, Claude, and whatever’s cooking at Amazon/Apple/Microsoft (behind the scenes as a contingency plan I’m sure) and the Chinese/Indian companies that don’t want to rely on the U.S.</p>
<p>It’s the early days of search: Yahoo, AOL, Ask Jeeves, etc. One will emerge as your favorite perhaps, like how we all use Google even though Bing probably isn’t that bad anymore (I wouldn’t know…).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Point is: it’s a race to the bottom, the customer is fickle. They know this, which is why they keep releasing new stuff every 6 months.</p>
<p>Point is: as you build your LLM application, your customer will be divinely discontent with <em>you</em>. This is nothing knew, it’s just the age of software development.</p>
<p>Expectations of what software can do are rising. Those expectations are becoming indiscernible from the magic that software is becoming.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for bowling</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bowling.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The car is put into park in the dark parking lot of the bowling alley. Rain descends, prompting hurried feet. The building door opens and we walk inside. <em>It’s bowling time.</em></p>
<p>Friends congregate, treats are consumed, and heavyweight spheroids enjoy the frictionless motion governed by Newtonian laws. The gutters are greedier than the pins, but regardless of where the ball ends up the hurler offers up a dance to the bowling gods, a laugh of disappointment, or a thrill of surprise. This has been the states of bowling regardless of the bowler’s age, across all known ages of my life.</p>
<p>The conversations, the dancing, the music, the flashing lights, the cheap food, the magic of self-returning balls - it is its own realm of simple enjoyment. Bowling won’t sell out stadiums, it’s rather boring compared to action sports. But that doesn’t stop anyone from enjoying it, and that’s why it’s a gift to humanity.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Home Depot Saturday Morning Crafts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/home-depot-saturday-morning-crafts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Home Depot gives out little assembly kits for kids on the first Saturday of every month. A few screws. A few pieces of wood. A simple design.</p>
<p>The chatter between children increases the closer they get to the supplier: a Home Depot working handing out presents to eager children.</p>
<p>Impatience grows the closer to the bag’s opening they become. They see other kids nearly finished around them. They can’t wait.</p>
<p>And so repeat the experience every first Saturday of every new month.</p>

  <title>The Iceberg Theory - Theory of Omission</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/the-iceberg-theory-theory-of-omission.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Hemingway introduced through his writing style the <a href="https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2023/1/1646.pdf">Iceberg Theory</a>. It was something I noticed while reading <a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a>. You feel the depth of emotion from the “actions and dialogue”, rather than explicit descriptions.</p>
<p>It’s fun to contrast that with <a href="../concepts/frank-herbert.html">Frank Herbert</a>’s style which is “lay out the environment, have dialogue, then draw conclusions in the mind”.</p>
<p>Both styles speak to the thought that the writing is more interesting the less you write about. They call this “negative space” in drawing. A sketch is interesting when the mind can fill in the gaps. As an artist, you just want to make enough dots that they can connect them themselves. This connecting process is the freedom and interest the mind craves. It doesn’t want to be coddled (<a href="../book-review/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.html">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>).</p>
<p>Back to the book. The Old Man and the Sea can be summarized in one sentence: a tired, old, and recently-unlucky man catches the biggest of his life and it gets eaten before he makes it home.</p>
<p>That’s the surface story, and it’s rather boring when thought of that way. But you just <em>feel</em> so much while reading it. You feel for the old man through the young boy. You feel for him as he teeters between passing out and existing. You remember the breaking points in your own life and want the man desperately to succeed. Luck, however, was not on his side.</p>
<p>“Talk less. Smile more.” - Hamilton</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-20-baptism-in-the-old-testament.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>The Isaiah chapters in Nephi often get skipped. But if you skip them, we miss out on important doctrine, like how “baptism” appears in the Nephi version of Isaiah 48 but not in the King James Version.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or <strong>out of the waters of baptism</strong>, who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in truth nor in righteousness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-20.1">1 Nephi 20.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-river-jordan-baptism.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Baptism</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>But if you compare to Isaiah 48, that line is not mentioned:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness. <a href="../scriptures/isaiah-48.1">Isaiah 48.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only reference to baptism in the Old Testament is found only in the chapter heading of 1 Kings 7:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The molten sea (baptismal font) rests on the backs of twelve oxen. <a href="../scriptures/1-kings-7">1 Kings 7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is clearly one of the “plain and precious” things taken, or lost in translation, from the Bible:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and <strong>also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away</strong>. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-13.26">1 Nephi 13.26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we know they practiced baptism in the Old Testament because Nephi lived and taught it, and the Pearl of Great Price talks about Adam’s baptism and ordination into the priesthood:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. 65 And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man. 66 And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever; 67 And thou art after the order of him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity. 68 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons. Amen. <a href="../scriptures/moses-6.64-68">Moses 6.64–68</a></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<ul>
<li>It was cool to notice this today, as that verse popped out to me and that word “baptism”. It makes me wonder what else was taken from these Isaiah chapters</li>
<li>How could Joseph Smith have ideated that baptism was in the Old Testament? All records we have are that Joseph wasn’t very literate or well known in the Bible. He didn’t even know that Jerusalem had a wall and had to ask Emma (<a href="../book-review/saints-book-1-the-standard-of-truth-1815-1846.html">Saints Book 1 The Standard of Truth 1815-1846</a>) This strengthens my testimony that he was inspired in translating it</li>
<li>It makes sense to me how valuable the Book of Mormon is to answer these longstanding questions.</li>
<li>Those who are of the house of Israel are those who are baptized. The baptized are adopted into the Abrahamic family. This is is consistent with Galatians 3:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise. <a href="../scriptures/galatians-3.27-29">Galatians 3.27–29</a></p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Peloton</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/peloton.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I grew up with exercise equipment in my house, and like most equipment for most people, I didn’t use it. Part of the reason was it was hard to get going.</p>
<p>There’s nothing easier than hopping on an exercise bike. Having been a runner most of my life, when I first got the Peloton I realized how nice it was to get a solid workout in 20 minutes. It’s just so easy with the little kilojoule calculator there.</p>
<p>And it could be any exercise bike, really, but I’m grateful for the one I have.</p>

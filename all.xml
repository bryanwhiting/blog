  <title>I’m Grateful for Bodyfulness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bodyfulness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Mindfulness is a state of mind. But being present with one’s body is another matter.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="../book-review/heal-your-nervous-system.html">Heal Your Nervous System</a> has been interesting as I’ve learned about additional senses beyond the five we commonly know. Certainly, meditating has had experiences for me that have been floaty feelings or what not.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I’ve had these experiences and know what they are.</p>

  <title>Easter Study: Seek Miracles</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/easter-seek-miracles.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the same way, the Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, “doubting nothing.” Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith. I promise that you can experience for yourself that Jesus Christ “giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.” Few things will accelerate your spiritual momentum more than realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life. <a href="../scriptures/russell-m-nelson-the-power-of-spiritual-momentum">“The Power of Spiritual Momentum”, Russell M. Nelson</a></p>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Reading this gives me pause. I have always thought not to seek for signs. “A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh signs” or what not. But this is different. This is seeking miracles, which is the Lord’s hand in our life.</p>
<p>If I seek a miracle, I seek Jesus’ hand in my life. His healing. His advice. His teachings. Those are and were His miracles.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Fairy Houses</title>

<p>It took us hours to build, and I’m not sure where the idea came from, but we each took time building something for the house. There’s an A frame, a Bon fire, a ladder, a circle swing. And most importantly: a door to the fire pit.</p>
<p>My wife commented, “I kinda wanna go out and play out there.”</p>
<p>It’s magical. It was a special time to work on this memory with our kids. I’m grateful for these moments that parenting provides. I don’t know when else it’d be so exciting to hit glue some sticks together. But it was.</p>

<p>Book: attachment disturbances in adults.</p>
<p>Five core needs of attachment(like a house) 1. foundation. Safety and protection. 2. Walls. Attunement. Attune to the feelings. Identify the feelings, provide safety for them. Create a supporting environment, attune to their needs. 3. Roof: sooltjing and comfort. Shelter and security. Reassurance and support. Touch. 4. Windows: expressed delight. Regularly express it. 5. Garden: support self development. Aim for good enough. Support them in new ways.</p>
<p>Secure attachment Dismissive attachment - Solves problems by avoidance or workaholic Preoccupied attachment - abandonemwnt, extra reassurance - Expressed delight was missing - Seek approval or reassurance. - Highly sensitive to rejection - Overshare personal details - Anxiety Disorganized or fearful attachment.</p>
<p>Imagine having your attachment needs met. IPF therapy. IPF protocol. Don’t just think about. Imagine. Feel everything of having met. - Deep breaths - Identify what you need: feeling supported. - Reflect - Imagine ideal parenting. - Create image of what ideal parent figures would look like. - Imagine those ideal parents interacting with your. Imagine them interacting with you in a nice scene. - Visualize and journal about ideal parent figures.</p>
<p>Track or be aware of your heart rate. Interoception: awareness of what things contribute to your stress.</p>
<p>Heartbeat awareness or breathing awareness. - Locate pulse - 30 seconds light. - Locate pulse - 1 minute of mild. - 30 seconds of locate pulse. - 2 minutes of intense</p>
<p>Interoceptive awareness. Body scan. Exteroceptive awareness: your surroundings.</p>
<p>Elevator alertness map: put coping strategies into the map.</p>

<ul>
<li>dog mind vs lion mind.</li>
<li>Create a gap: observe your thoughts</li>
<li>Eight senses. Proprioceptive awareness.</li>
<li>Bodyfulness. Bring your whole body.</li>
<li>Relaxing stretches:
<ul>
<li>Eyes to right, Ear to right shoulder, eyes still right</li>
<li>Salamander: neutral spine on all 4s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Diagnosis. How you feel. Disease. Three pillars of wellness.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-03-27</p>
<ul>
<li>sensitivity: like an orchid or a tulip.</li>
<li>Belief: those who are more sensitive can rewire faster.</li>
<li>Neuroplasticity: past patterns can be rewired completely without long term entrenchment</li>
<li>Four areas</li>
<li>Embedded alarms: why you don’t make the same mistake twice, or become afraid of dogs.</li>
<li>Misrepresenting the word “trauma” can cause you to feel higher emotional reactions to more benign experiences. → how you perceive the word and its definition affects you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Five stages - awareness - Sensory stimulatjon - active proprioception - jump rope - passive Proprioceptive - Massage gun - Deep tissue - Tactile input - Manipulate textured - Olfactory input - Oral (tasting) - Visual - Sleep - Light 10 min after waking. - Light for 10 min in late afternoon. - Dim lights after sunlight, keep low to the ground - Regulation - restoration - Connection - Expansion</p>

  <title>On file formats: parquet vs csv</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/on-file-formats-parquet-vs-csv.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Came across this article today: <a href="https://kaveland.no/friends-dont-let-friends-export-to-csv.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">Robin’s blog – Friends don’t let friends export to CSV</a></p>
<p>This has largely been my experience too: go with the file format that’s fast reading in and out.</p>
<p>It’s rare a data scientist with open a file on their computer rather than just <code>pd.read_*()</code> it in.</p>
<p>In my last job, we were using <code>jsonl</code> files for no other reason than it how one person liked to use command line tools to analyze it.</p>
<p>But if you’re using command line tools to inspect a data file, and not just a Python repl, you’ve already gone down the wrong direction IMO. But what if you’re on a remote server and don’t have pandas installed? Yea, that’s not something you should plan for. At that point, just scp the file to a place you can read it.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Ever Shifting Tides</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/ever-shifting-tides.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The tech industry is pretty crazy. I was just watching some keynote talks from Nvidia and if they actually land half of the stuff they’re talking about, they’re going to just plow the world in a new direction.</p>
<p>I watch it and probably feel both awe and fear. What will the future look like? And will I do anything that cool? I kind of look at my little bag of talents and wonder how I fit into this big world.</p>
<p>But I do. I do fit in. I’m a part of that tide of shifting technology, of pushing the boundaries forward. I’m grateful for a job in tech. It isn’t easy. But it’s rewarding. It’s changing people’s lives.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Better Health</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/better-health.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Having the flu stinks. I realized quickly this week how a life revolves around health. My ability to do my job, to be there for my family, and even enjoy sitting on the couch is all impacted by what’s going on inside my body.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is: when I’m sick, I only want to get better and I realize what’s most important. But as I get better, my mind focuses in equal proportion on the normal preoccupations of life and I perhaps focus less on the things I had just realized were most important.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for good health.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for CS Lewis</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/cs-lewis.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Probably and odd thing to be thankful for, but I’m grateful for this guy’s legacy. Having read <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a> and <a href="../book-review/the-oxford-inklings-lewis-tolkien-and-their-circle.html">The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle</a> I decided to read <a href="../book-review/mere-christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve read a few things by Lewis and have enjoyed his writing. It’s also fun to better imagine him writing it when he was at Oxford in 1940’s.</p>
<p>His writing continues to influence millions. I’m grateful he chose to write what he did even though people around him didn’t want him to.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the feeling of Skimboarding</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/the-feeling-of-skimboarding.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I only had 10 minutes to skimboard today. But I saw this little flat spot off to the side, where the waves were receding slowly. It looked perfect.</p>
<p>First one or two were a bit slow. But then I started to pick it up again. Pretty soon I was running compulsively to the next wave, just like when I was 22 when I really learned.</p>

</div>
<p>Then I had a great run. Hit the crash of the wave as best as I’ve ever done it. Didn’t wipe out. Just a great, energizing feeling.</p>

<p>I want these young men to come away with an appreciation for the restoration of the gospel and how the Book of Mormon plays a role in their lives.</p>
<p>How do I get a seven year old class to appreciate the Book of Mormon? The restoration?</p>

<p>And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.3">2 Nephi 27.3</a></p>

<h1>Lesson</h1>
<p>Know: What the apostasy is. What a prophet is. Feel: that they’re alive at a special time. Do: ask Heavenly Father if this church is the true church. And keep asking.</p>
<p>Activity: - apostasy. - Every boy is a prophet. - They need to invite people to repent. Repent and come unto Jesus. - Everyone else throws things at them. - Ask: who would you rather be - the one listening or preaching? - Have a pause for one minute of silence for how long the time was that they didn’t have a prophet.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 27 The Purpose of the Book of Mormon</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-27-the-purpose-of-the-book-of-mormon.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>This chapter doesn’t lay about all the purposes of the Book of Mormon, but it lays out some.</p>
<p>Purpose: help people eat and be filled. The souls who aren’t fed are like hungry men who dream of eating but awake empty.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.3">2 Nephi 27.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book is a revelation. It’s a miracle in itself. It’s a witness of all things, and a testament of its translator.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.7">2 Nephi 27.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be a revelation of the doctrines that have been taught since the foundation of the world and will be taught until the end of it:<sup>1</sup></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.11">2 Nephi 27.11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence that this is the Lord’s work, because he turned a plow boy into a translator of a sealed book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.20">2 Nephi 27.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will do a marvelous work through this book. It’ll be the means of converting people to Him and His gospel:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-27.26">2 Nephi 27.26</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Freedom of Religion</title>

<p>I’m grateful for the freedom of religion. I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-happiest-man-on-earth.html">The Happiest Man on Earth</a> right now and cannot fathom the horrid experiences Eddie had to endure.</p>
<p>When we (as humans) start labeling and blaming groups of people for our problems, we begin dehumanizing them and they’re no longer worth anything to us. And if we have power, we can choose to destroy them.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how depraved humanity can become. It happened to the Germans, but it can happen anywhere. It happened in the U.S. with slavery and civil rights failures.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the freedom of religion. It hasn’t always been free. My ancestors were shot at in Missouri and driven from their home in Nauvoo to cross the plains in the winter with nothing but dirt to eat to pacify their hunger.</p>
<p>They crawled on their hands in the frozen tundra because it’s all they could do.</p>
<p>Some survived. But not all.</p>
<p>Today I enjoy freedoms they didn’t have. The freedom to not have to cross a frozen tundra on my hands and feet because I’m a member of <a href="../concepts/the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.html">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.</p>

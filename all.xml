  <title>1 Nephi 22 - His Covenants will be the key of the Gathering of Israel</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-22-gathered-by-his-covenants.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>There is so much doctrine packed in here. Nephi is talking about the Lord doing a ‚Äúmarvelous work‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it [the marvelous work] shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, <strong>unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham</strong>, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, <strong>in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel</strong>. Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they <strong>shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-22.9-12">1 Nephi 22.9‚Äì12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will restore His covenants. It doesn‚Äôt explicitly say ‚Äúbaptism, the sacrament, the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the endowment, and the sealing ordinance‚Äù, but that‚Äôs what Nephi is referring to.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">The Lord will gather us into His silo. This is His work, not ours.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Why doesn‚Äôt the Book of Mormon mention the sealing ordinance? The Melchizedek priesthood (the name of it)? The endowment? I‚Äôm not sure. But it‚Äôs fascinating how Joseph Smith translated this book but also received revelations to help finalize the structure of the church. # Meaning</p>
<p>This teaches me that‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord cares about people who reject him. He will do His work among them. He won‚Äôt leave me even if I leave Him. That‚Äôs a powerful concept.</li>
<li>The covenants are the most important thing to focus on in the scriptures. Everything else is just context about how to best live them.</li>
<li>I am gathered when I keep my covenants. They are the thing that help me understand and connect with the Lord.</li>
</ul>

<h1>There is Divine Discontent in the Consumer Appetite</h1>
<p>Jeff Bezos alluded to the ‚Äúdivinely discontent‚Äù customer in a 2017 shareholder letter (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/">Elements of Amazon‚Äôs Day 1 Culture | AWS Executive Insights</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static ‚Äì they go up. It‚Äôs human nature. We didn‚Äôt ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday‚Äôs ‚Äòwow‚Äô quickly becomes today‚Äôs ‚Äòordinary‚Äô. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/Amazon_Shareholder_Letter.pdf">2017 Amazon_Shareholder_Letter.pdf</a></p>

</div>
<p>More googling shows the phrase was also used by Neal A Maxwell in 1976 (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng">Notwithstanding My Weakness</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What can we do to manage these vexing feelings of inadequacy? Here are but a few suggestions: (1) We can distinguish more clearly between <strong>divine discontent</strong> and the devil‚Äôs dissonance, between dissatisfaction with self and disdain for self. We need the first and must shun the second, remembering that when conscience calls to us from the next ridge, it is not solely to scold but also to beckon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Just dropping that in case Bezos gets all the credit for the term üòâ.)</p>

<section id="llm-discontent" class="level1">
<h1>LLM Discontent</h1>
<p>People grappling with building LLMs are facing this discontent at an alarming rate. The <a href="../tech/llm-chatbot-arena-leaderboard.html">LLM Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a> is a testament to how quickly appetites will change. Many AI tool providers refrain from vendor lock in and try to build LLM agnostic tooling.</p>
<p>How do you compete? Well, most of us aren‚Äôt building these foundational models. How do they compete with each other? None of us care. We just want a good one.</p>
<p>But ask yourself, would you rather have Bard from today or nothing from 2022?</p>
<p>These leaderboards are fascinating because in 14 months since ChatGPT emerged we‚Äôve become so reliant on these tools but yet they‚Äôre not even old enough to walk or talk by human standards. Yet we now have Bard, ChatGPT, LLaMA, Mistral, Claude, and whatever‚Äôs cooking at Amazon/Apple/Microsoft (behind the scenes as a contingency plan I‚Äôm sure) and the Chinese/Indian companies that don‚Äôt want to rely on the U.S.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the early days of search: Yahoo, AOL, Ask Jeeves, etc. One will emerge as your favorite perhaps, like how we all use Google even though Bing probably isn‚Äôt that bad anymore (I wouldn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Point is: it‚Äôs a race to the bottom, the customer is fickle. They know this, which is why they keep releasing new stuff every 6 months.</p>
<p>Point is: as you build your LLM application, your customer will be divinely discontent with <em>you</em>. This is nothing knew, it‚Äôs just the age of software development.</p>
<p>Expectations of what software can do are rising. Those expectations are becoming indiscernible from the magic that software is becoming.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for bowling</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/bowling.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The car is put into park in the dark parking lot of the bowling alley. Rain descends, prompting hurried feet. The building door opens and we walk inside. <em>It‚Äôs bowling time.</em></p>
<p>Friends congregate, treats are consumed, and heavyweight spheroids enjoy the frictionless motion governed by Newtonian laws. The gutters are greedier than the pins, but regardless of where the ball ends up the hurler offers up a dance to the bowling gods, a laugh of disappointment, or a thrill of surprise. This has been the states of bowling regardless of the bowler‚Äôs age, across all known ages of my life.</p>
<p>The conversations, the dancing, the music, the flashing lights, the cheap food, the magic of self-returning balls - it is its own realm of simple enjoyment. Bowling won‚Äôt sell out stadiums, it‚Äôs rather boring compared to action sports. But that doesn‚Äôt stop anyone from enjoying it, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a gift to humanity.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Home Depot Saturday Morning Crafts</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/home-depot-saturday-morning-crafts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Home Depot gives out little assembly kits for kids on the first Saturday of every month. A few screws. A few pieces of wood. A simple design.</p>
<p>The chatter between children increases the closer they get to the supplier: a Home Depot working handing out presents to eager children.</p>
<p>Impatience grows the closer to the bag‚Äôs opening they become. They see other kids nearly finished around them. They can‚Äôt wait.</p>
<p>And so repeat the experience every first Saturday of every new month.</p>

  <title>The Iceberg Theory - Theory of Omission</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/the-iceberg-theory-theory-of-omission.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Hemingway introduced through his writing style the <a href="https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2023/1/1646.pdf">Iceberg Theory</a>. It was something I noticed while reading <a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a>. You feel the depth of emotion from the ‚Äúactions and dialogue‚Äù, rather than explicit descriptions.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs fun to contrast that with <a href="../concepts/frank-herbert.html">Frank Herbert</a>‚Äôs style which is ‚Äúlay out the environment, have dialogue, then draw conclusions in the mind‚Äù.</p>
<p>Both styles speak to the thought that the writing is more interesting the less you write about. They call this ‚Äúnegative space‚Äù in drawing. A sketch is interesting when the mind can fill in the gaps. As an artist, you just want to make enough dots that they can connect them themselves. This connecting process is the freedom and interest the mind craves. It doesn‚Äôt want to be coddled (<a href="../book-review/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind.html">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>).</p>
<p>Back to the book. The Old Man and the Sea can be summarized in one sentence: a tired, old, and recently-unlucky man catches the biggest of his life and it gets eaten before he makes it home.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the surface story, and it‚Äôs rather boring when thought of that way. But you just <em>feel</em> so much while reading it. You feel for the old man through the young boy. You feel for him as he teeters between passing out and existing. You remember the breaking points in your own life and want the man desperately to succeed. Luck, however, was not on his side.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTalk less. Smile more.‚Äù - Hamilton</p>

<p>Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or <strong>out of the waters of baptism</strong>, who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in truth nor in righteousness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-20.1">1 Nephi 20.1</a></p>

<p>Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness. <a href="../scriptures/isaiah-48.1">Isaiah 48.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only reference to baptism in the Old Testament is found only in the chapter heading of 1 Kings 7:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The molten sea (baptismal font) rests on the backs of twelve oxen. <a href="../scriptures/1-kings-7">1 Kings 7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is clearly one of the ‚Äúplain and precious‚Äù things taken, or lost in translation, from the Bible:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and <strong>also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away</strong>. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-13.26">1 Nephi 13.26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we know they practiced baptism in the Old Testament because Nephi lived and taught it, and the Pearl of Great Price talks about Adam‚Äôs baptism and ordination into the priesthood:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. 65 And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man. 66 And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever; 67 And thou art after the order of him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity. 68 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons. Amen. <a href="../scriptures/moses-6.64-68">Moses 6.64‚Äì68</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<ul>
<li>It was cool to notice this today, as that verse popped out to me and that word ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù. It makes me wonder what else was taken from these Isaiah chapters</li>
<li>How could Joseph Smith have ideated that baptism was in the Old Testament? All records we have are that Joseph wasn‚Äôt very literate or well known in the Bible. He didn‚Äôt even know that Jerusalem had a wall and had to ask Emma (<a href="../book-review/saints-book-1-the-standard-of-truth-1815-1846.html">Saints Book 1 The Standard of Truth 1815-1846</a>) This strengthens my testimony that he was inspired in translating it</li>
<li>It makes sense to me how valuable the Book of Mormon is to answer these longstanding questions.</li>
<li>Those who are of the house of Israel are those who are baptized. The baptized are adopted into the Abrahamic family. This is is consistent with Galatians 3:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if ye be Christ‚Äôs, then are ye Abraham‚Äôs seed, and heirs according to the promise. <a href="../scriptures/galatians-3.27-29">Galatians 3.27‚Äì29</a></p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Peloton</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I grew up with exercise equipment in my house, and like most equipment for most people, I didn‚Äôt use it. Part of the reason was it was hard to get going.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs nothing easier than hopping on an exercise bike. Having been a runner most of my life, when I first got the Peloton I realized how nice it was to get a solid workout in 20 minutes. It‚Äôs just so easy with the little kilojoule calculator there.</p>
<p>And it could be any exercise bike, really, but I‚Äôm grateful for the one I have.</p>

  <title>The Compounding Interest of Reading</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I‚Äôm on my way to get 52 books read this year. I think I can do it.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs not to finish 52 books. It‚Äôs to read two hours of fifty two books. Why?</p>
<p>Because of compounding interest. One book doesn‚Äôt level you up. But multiple books over time will affect you for a long while to come.</p>
<p>If you improve just 1% each day for 365 days, and that improvement compounds, then you‚Äôll have improved 37x over a year. (invest $100 and gain 1% each day and reinvest that money is $137 by the end of the year).</p>
<p>So don‚Äôt worry what any one book gives you. Just keep investing. A few will pay off big, and the many ‚Äúwasted‚Äù will have little downside.</p>

  <title>The Power of a Good Book</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/the-power-of-a-good-book.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Last night I went to a tapas style restaurant. I got 5 things. Then we opted for one more: battered cod tacos. Our taste buds rewarded us. That‚Äôs why we came.</p>
<p>Before that I was telling my wife, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why my friend didn‚Äôt like the sushi. It‚Äôs fine. I just don‚Äôt know how to evaluate if something is worth it or not. Because it‚Äôs tasty, I‚Äôd recommend it‚Ä¶‚Äù This came off the heels of multiple times recently where I‚Äôve gone out with people who are foodies that criticize the meal I‚Äôm enjoying and I‚Äôm left wondering: am I a food plebe?</p>
<p>Experiencing this last night was poignant. The whole meal was good. Not bad. Just good.</p>
<p>Then came the fish tacos.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs how it is with reading. You need to read a lot before the good and the bad start filtering out.</p>
<p>And like fish tacos, maybe there are even better ones out there, but I needed this one to point me in the direction of what‚Äôs possible.</p>
<p>And to some degree, there‚Äôs a dulling of sensitivities. If you haven‚Äôt read good literature in a long while perhaps you assume it‚Äôs all fine and ‚Äúwhy <em>not</em> finish this book?‚Äù</p>
<p>But this year I‚Äôm trying to read many authors across many genres to tackle just that: find the books I really enjoy reading. And then ask myself, ‚Äúwhy? What was special there?‚Äù So that I know what to look for next.</p>
<p>Last night I began <a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a> and it was a fish taco moment. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve avoided this book so long. I‚Äôm sure I read it in like sixth grade, but does that even count? And why have I largely avoided fiction for most of my adult life? I suppose having studied something very technical in college it pushed me to stop using that side of my brain. But getting back to good books, written with such depth and creative imagination, renew me with an awareness of the dullness of business books I‚Äôve been dwelling in.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-old-man-and-the-fish-tacos.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">An Old Man and His Tacos</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And now, for ChatGPT to answer the prompt: ‚Äúin the style of Ernest Hemingway, write three paragraphs about a man eating fish tacos‚Äù:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the style of Ernest Hemingway, characterized by his terse and direct prose, the tale unfolds on a weathered pier stretching into the gray, restless sea. The man, solitary and rugged, sits at the edge where the wood meets the water, a plate of fish tacos beside him. His hands, calloused and strong, deftly assemble the tacos with an economy of movement that speaks of a life shaped by necessity rather than choice. The fish, freshly caught, bears the scent of the ocean, a fragrance as old as time, mingling with the sharp tang of lime and cilantro.</p>
<p>Around him, the world seems to hold its breath, the only sounds are the soft lapping of waves against the pilings and the distant cries of gulls, wheeling like specters in the overcast sky. He bites into a taco, the crispness of the tortilla giving way to the tender fish within, a simplicity that belies the depth of flavors. There‚Äôs a harmony here, between man and nature, a momentary peace found in the act of eating, of sustaining oneself with the bounty of the sea.</p>
<p>As he eats, his gaze is drawn to the horizon, where the gray of the sea blends indistinguishably with the sky. There‚Äôs a contemplation in his eyes, a man adrift in his thoughts as he is in life, finding solace in the simple pleasure of a meal. The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself‚Äîuncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction. In this moment, on this pier, the man and the sea are one, their stories intertwined in the quiet, unspoken understanding that life, in all its forms, is a series of solitary moments shared with the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dang‚Ä¶‚Äúlife shaped by necessity rather than choice‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself‚Äîuncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad Ernest is somewhere in there, AI. You may have a soul after all.</p>

<p>Runs GPT locally, has tons of templates, can interact with your screen. Run ChatGPT plus locally.</p>
<p>I have not used it. Just thought it‚Äôs cool. # commentary I don‚Äôt see why Open AI can‚Äôt build something like this, but they‚Äôre focused on much higher value problems such as solving enterprise hunger.</p>
<p>So we‚Äôll see niche tools like this that pop up and solve the needs of a few - satisfying the developer costs of some indie programmers. thinking of Innovators Dilemma, there‚Äôs just not enough juice in this lemon for Open AI to squeeze, but plenty for a small fish.</p>

  <title>I‚Äôm Grateful for Compliments</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/compliments.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I‚Äôm grateful for compliments. The ones I receive and the ones I can give.</p>
<p>The cheapest thing you can give someone is a compliment. Yet it may be the most valuable gift to be given.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm reading <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a> which talks about ‚Äúreciprocity‚Äù. People feel someone obligated to help you when you give them something, even if it‚Äôs nominal. Isn‚Äôt a compliment a gift?</p>
<p><a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> also discusses the benefits of being kind, and putting yourself in another‚Äôs shoes. Kindness far exceeds the benefits of criticism. A compliment is a way to think about what that person may want to hear and to give them that. Not in an insincere way, but in a sincere way.</p>
<p>People act how they want to be treated. If they show up to play basketball they want to be told they‚Äôre good at basketball. If they work on a task for you, it‚Äôs because they want to be told they‚Äôre good at that task. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to be nice. To give a compliment. So give away.</p>
<p>Being human is recognizing what other people aspire for and recognize that goodness in them. So notice. Notice what they‚Äôre after. Then give. Give freely, for so did He (<a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.html">Bread given freely, like His life</a>).</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 19 - Yieldeth Himself</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-19-yieldeth-himself.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>On Sunday I was thinking about <a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.html">Bread given freely, like His life</a>. It‚Äôs powerful to read this verse today:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, <strong>yieldeth himself</strong>, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-19.10">1 Nephi 19.10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also <a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-in-the-oven.html">Bread in the Oven</a> post touches here.</p>
<p>He gave His life freely. He yielded himself.</p>
<p>So much doctrine is packed in this one verse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ had all power. He was a deity.</li>
<li>He obeyed the father.</li>
<li>He fulfilled prophesy.</li>
<li>He was the God of Abraham. He is distinct from the Father.</li>
<li>It was prophesied he would resurrect. Prophets in America knew this.</li>
<li>There is a space between death and the resurrection. Christ lived in that space for 3 days.</li>
<li>There are prophets who have testified of the Lord whom we don‚Äôt have records from.</li>
<li>Jesus delivered the Israelites. ‚Üí the Israelites then delivered him unto the cross.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>Every scripture in the Book of Mormon can contain some or many truths about the Savior. There‚Äôs always something to learn.</p>
<p>Humility is the process of putting the Lord‚Äôs wishes above my own, as He put the Father‚Äôs wishes above perhaps his own (yet they are one).</p>

<li>I love how he speaks a thought, then follows up with reality. Like ‚Äúcome on, catch the hook‚Äù ‚Äúbut the hook did not catch‚Äù</li>
<li>Repetitive words used in new ways evoke new meaning</li>
<li>Keep it simple. <a href="../posts/mark-cuban-mogul-support.html">Mark Cuban Mogul Support</a> - don‚Äôt use a big word when a simpler one will do. He evokes strong emotion without much fanciful language.</li>
<li>Your mind fills in the blanks. He encodes the intuition of 50 years of fishing in plain words. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got enough line‚Ä¶‚Äù is not a calculation. <a href="../book-review/wool.html">Wool</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> are much more</li>

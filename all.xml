  <title>Implementing Culture</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/implementing-culture.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>One of the most important asset a company wields is its culture.</p>
<p>A culture is hard to define, but you know it when you see it. It’s the collective personality and written and unwritten rules of engagement. Since corporate employment is a social contract of two at-will parties, the culture emerges from the rules of conduct in which the employer is satisfied with continuing employment of the employee.</p>
<p>Values are lip service without implementation. Assume your company has the value “be kind”. Everyone has a different interpretation of what that means to them.</p>
<p>How do you know what a good culture is? People know the values of the culture and can highlight practices examples of it. The culture should live naturally, but also mechanically. Meaning, an employee will be kind while holding the door open for someone (be kind), but also provide explicit growth-oriented feedback.</p>
<p>Signs of a bad culture are therefore evident in the opposite of my definition. Like Lord of the Flies, employees are fending for survival and constantly exploring the boundaries because there are now rules of government. Employees that can’t recount what the values are or demonstrate how the company mechanically employs them are hoping for natural demonstration but get confused when they get mixed signals.</p>
<p>Toxic cultures can achieve financial success. “Toxic” has no concrete definition, but probably reveals people trying to survive on the island rather than thrive in a civilization. It stands, therefore, that a great culture will endure the battles of business, and come out tighter. At some point it won’t matter how bright your people are, how clever your IP is, or how many customers you have: culture is the rudder.</p>

  <title>Nothing to Lose</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/nothing-to-lose.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There was a moment when I had everything to lose. When I was junior in high school, I was scared I’d be cut from the lacrosse team. There was only one coach and he didn’t have space for everybody. Coach held try outs.</p>
<p>My dad was traveling the week of try outs. I gave him a call. “What if I don’t make the team?”</p>
<p>He waits till I finish. And in a way characteristic of my Dad, he re-emphasizes the question. “<em>What</em> if? You go out there, you play your hardest, you give it your all. The rest is out of your hands. If you get cut, you get cut.”</p>
<p>He didn’t give me false praise or reassurance. He gave me perspective on life. He gave me “nothing to lose.”</p>
<p>I never worked harder in my athletics than that week. I just didn’t want to get cut.</p>
<p>Well, I passed try outs. So did everyone else because it was just a coaching trick to motivate us…but that’s beside the point. But my dad’s advice was never lost on me.</p>
<p>I had low confidence the whole season. Yet my coach took a surprising interest in me. I got playing time as a junior. I was a part time defender.</p>
<p>Little did I know, nor could I ever have imagined as a defender who could barely pass or catch, that in my coach’s last game, I would be sitting on the wrong side of the field. I would be standing, as a defender, right in front of the opposing team’s goalie crease. I’m not quite sure how I got there as the whole season I always sprinted off the field whenever we transitioned from defense to offense.</p>
<p>My coach always yelled at me. “Stay on the field!! It’s a fast break!” But I was always terrified of dropping the ball. I was great at defense. Great at scooping the ball. Great at passing it to an offender. This was my safe place.</p>
<p>Yet here I was, in the final minutes of the game. We had three, they had five. And I’m on the crease. What was I doing here?</p>
<p>My eyes and voice called to my teammate who saw me. My teammate who knew full well I had no intention of actually catching the ball. My teammate who would love to pass it to me if he had any assurance I’d actually catch it. I could see his eyes lock with mine and it only takes 8 years playing a sport to recognize that split-second glance, “Are you going to actually catch this?” My eyes asserted in that moment with my stick extended and ready “I really don’t know. But I’m wide open and I’m on the crease. And you have the defender and not me. So make a call.”</p>
<p>To my surprise he actually passed it. It didn’t have to be a just perfunctory vanity motion to please the coach. Because I’ve called for the ball many times in that wrote script, “oh please pass it I swear it’s worth all our time okay I did my thing now you guys go score because I’m outta here!”</p>
<p>I catch. I turn. I dunk. 4-5.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>I asked Teddy later why he actually passed it to me. “I figured, what the heck? Maybe he’ll catch it!!” We both laughed. He had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>I didn’t know it then, but it was the last goal anybody would score for my coach. It was the last game of the season. The last game of his 35 year career at our school. I was wholly undeserving.</p>
<p>And that’s when you stand most to gain.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 13 - Enduring Beauty</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-13-enduring-beauty.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>While this scripture is sad, it tells some important truths:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon; 19 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers; 20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings; 21 The rings, and nose jewels; 22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins; 23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils. 24 And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty. 25 Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-13.18-25">2 Nephi 13.18–25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lists out all the things we think are so important, but really at the end of the day are meaningless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our dress</li>
<li>our decorations and fine things</li>
<li>Our hair</li>
<li>Our beauty # Meaning</li>
</ul>
<p>Beauty is a closeness with the Lord. Adhering to His gospel.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet! 16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace! 17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever! 18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people; <a href="../scriptures/mosiah-15.15-18">Mosiah 15.15–18</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Dune</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/dune.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just watched the movie Dune again for the second time in four months. I’m excited for Dune 2 this weekend. And I’ve also read <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune-messiah.html">Dune: Messiah</a>…yea it’s been a Dune four months.</p>
<p>Dune got me back into fiction. I enjoy Herbert’s style of writing. Very smart, very thoughtful. You can tell he really thinks through a lot of things that he barely mentions in the book. I think this gives the book a certain richness - less is more. But when creating universes, those details provide a colorful backdrop.</p>
<p>I’m impressed by how good the movie is, and how true it is to the book. It’s rare to have a movie so close to the book.</p>
<p>It’s just fun to read.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for the Barber</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/charlie-the-barber.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It was my first time visiting Mr.&nbsp;Barber today. He captured my attention as he stopped cutting someone’s hair, popped his head out the open door, and called “do your kids want a lollipop?”</p>
<p>A little different than asking kids to get into a van, but the principle is the same. It works. Who doesn’t like a lollipop?</p>
<p>He was hilarious. His wife was too (she cut my hair).</p>
<p>When I went to pay, I learned they don’t accept credit card. Cash or check only.</p>
<p>It wasn’t their first experience with this. “Just pay us back the next time you come in.” What?! Seriously?</p>
<p>I insisted I’ll be back soon. Mr.&nbsp;Barber seemed indifferent, “Nah, just come back whenever. No rush.”</p>
<p>His kindness reminded me of the reciprocity rule in <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a>. People feel like they have a debt they need to pay when you do something nice for them.</p>
<p>This obviously wasn’t Charlie’s goal: to have us not pay him. But he understands reciprocity. He knows he’ll see me again.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 11 - Seeing My Redeemer</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-11-seeing-my-redeemer.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Nephi explains why he writes the words of Isaiah in his record:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for <strong>he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him</strong>. And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-11.2-3">2 Nephi 11.2–3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, he read the words and enjoyed reading them. Second, he identified with Isaiah - he felt a common bond with him, namely that they had both seen the Redeemer. Third, He wants to establish a testimony to his posterity by saying “Isaiah saw it, but Jacob and I did too. And there will be others as well.”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-jesus-at-the-temple-newborn.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Seeing the Savior"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Can I say I’ve seen my Redeemer?</p>
<p>Nephi wasn’t Moses. He wasn’t the son of Moses. He was the son of a dad who was called to preach to people. There were many prophets like Lehi, per 1 Nephi 1. But Lehi was chosen to leave. Nephi was diligent in His duties.</p>
<p>Seeing the Redeemer is a spiritual event. Moroni was visited by the Lord, “And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus.” (<a href="../scriptures/mormon-1.15">Mormon 1.15</a>)</p>
<p>If we recall, many were visited by Jesus and saw him with their physical eyes and didn’t recognize Him (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-16.15-17.html">Matthew 16.15-17</a>).</p>
<p>Then there was King Lamoni who also experienced a spiritual witness of the Lord: “For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have <strong>seen my Redeemer</strong>; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name.” (<a href="../scriptures/alma-19.13">Alma 19.13</a>) Was King Lamoni a prophet? No.&nbsp;A week before this spiritual experience he was sentencing his servants to death for not taking good enough care of his flocks.</p>
<p>I’m not sure there is a pre-requisite to “seeing” the Lord. I’m also not sure that seeing him with your literal eyes is important at all. But gaining a witness from the Holy Ghost that Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Chosen One on whom we rely on for forgiveness…this is what matters. If ye seek, ye shall find.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for my Laundry Machine</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/laundry-machine.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Ode to the laundry machine. That tumbling beast. That water container with a motor. That rigid ridged dirt ridder.</p>
<p>I’ve lived without you at one point. I washed my clothes on a concrete slab for two years. I bloodied my knuckles on the slab, scraping back and forth.</p>
<p>By comparison, tossing clothing in, moving it from a wetting box to drying box, etc. doesn’t seem all that bad. It’s actually quite wonderful.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Choice</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/choice.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Choice is a concept. It’s a gift. It’s a freedom we all have to some, if not every, degree.</p>
<p>The simplest choice is to wake up. From there, it’s about what to eat. Drink. Where to walk. Move. Talk.</p>
<p>And that’s really all a day is - talking, walking, drinking, eating…all while being awake.</p>
<p>This is life. This is the power of choice.</p>

<p>Life is kind of like going down a river. Can’t choose the rocks, but you can choose how to navigate them.</p>

  <title>The Sun Also Rises</title>
  <dc:creator>Ernest Hemingway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/book-review/the-sun-also-rises.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The story is one of Brett and her influence on a group of men. Jake, whom she doesn’t want to be with because of an injury, Robert Cohn, who wanted to treat her well, then Mike who is a count, bankrupt, and a Lord with access to money, and Bill, who doesn’t interact with Brett much.</p>
<p>Then Brett runs away with Pedro.</p>
<p>She can’t help herself. She ends up back in Jake’s arms, asking him for help when she could have asked Mike. She settles on Mike.</p>
<p>She lives without morals - floating with the sea. Jake is an observer.</p>
<p>Personal impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>the dialogue is captivating. Calming in a sense. Meditative. Simple.</li>
<li>On its surface all that happens is chats at bars, a bull fight, and a lot of drinking.</li>
<li>They all want something more, and end up fighting each other for it. None</li>
<li>All the characters are predictable. Their arcs hardly evolve. They just meander. And perhaps that’s the point. It’s the lost generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>2024-02-26</p>
<ul>
<li>hemingway’s writing is so calming.</li>
<li><a href="../creative/prose-nuzzle.html">Nuzzle</a> was written as inspiration…</li>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Guitars</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tonight I saw an international guitar concert, with four musicians from Italy, Australia, Brazil, and Vietnam. It’s incredible how each adapted the guitar to their own styles. One instrument, so much possibility.</p>
<p>I learned to play the guitar in college. It was the first time I felt like I understood what it meant to speak another language, despite having learned Spanish. Being able to communicate using an instrument was a powerful experience.</p>

<p>Solid read: https://markmanson.net/attention-diet Over the last year I had read a few things similar to the points here and went on an “low information” diet (Tim Ferriss quote?).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I don’t miss the global news. It only got me angry.</p></li>
<li><p>The point of learning something is to take action and create positive change in the world. If I learn about things I don’t plan to take action on,</p></li>
<li><p>if that sounds uneducated, another reason to learn something is to gain empathy and change my perspective. However, the global news is generally biased by the wars for subscriptions between a handful of editors.</p></li>
<li><p>Niche news is far more educative. I’ve subscribed to blogs, to specific influencers in my field, etc. I’ve learned things from these people that I can apply that day in my job. I’m subscribing to things that feed my career.</p></li>
<li><p>long form content is far better way to understand current events. If you want to understand the state of the world, read a book on it. Most major geopolitical events are insanely complicated and cannot be surmised in 126 characters. Read a few books on the things you care about.</p></li>
<li><p>there’s so much thought put into even a low quality book. Think about it: most books get reviewed by editors in the very least. They probably get read once or twice at least by the original authors. So what would be a better time for your energy - a low quality book or a set of posts on LinkedIn likely generated by ChatGPT or Jasper.ai? If a low quality book &gt; than a tweet, surely 30 min a day of a high quality book (easy to find) is worth more than most low quality content.</p></li>
<li><p>I broke my iPhone in 2020 and waited 45 days for a replacement. But it wasn’t fully broken - the screen was hopelessly shattered on the bottom half where typing is required. So I kept it in my drawer and only used it when I needed to. The risk of using it? Getting a shard of glass stuck in my finger. I wish I still had that to some degree because it forced me to be focused. I realized very few people texted me anything urgent that couldn’t wait a few days. I could still call people with Siri, but nobody called. We’re optimized to be addicted. That’s literally the goal of these phones and the apps on them. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just not in our best interest.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried using a junk $40 replacement phone I found in my closet while waiting those 45 days to get my iPhone replacement. The phone was from 2015 when I got married - it was a teaser phone from the cell company. It probably downloaded at 2 mbp/s. Any time I clicked a link I had to wait 15-20 seconds for the page to load.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I was amazed. I was shocked this piece of junk actually could take notes. Could email. Could browse the internet. But I also learned not to click on things unless it was worth 30 seconds of my time.</p>
<p>How do I spend my time now? Not wisely enough. A lot of things should be done on a computer. Most things should be planned. Few things are urgent. Fewer are essential.</p>

<ul>
<li>storytelling: I really like how <a href="../book-review/shift.html">Shift</a> does the psychological aspect of perishing. Last moments, last thoughts. I think Tolkien could have enhanced some of the fighting scenes by documenting the last moments.</li>
<li>It’s interesting how in the movie the destruction is the big climax, but in the book Isengard is already destroyed before they get there. I like the suspense of not knowing what’s going to happen.</li>
<li>But the nature of LOtR is that it’s a story told by people. A story within stories. The council of Elrond was very well written. Stories within stories. Each person telling their own story.</li>
<li>I like how Tolkien has so much back context. That’s what makes it so interesting. It’s not just Frodo’s story. But Frodo is context amidst a great history of many people.</li>
<li>It makes sense why LOTR is really just one book. That’s how it’s written. One massive epic.</li>

  <title>A Treatise on Agency and Goals</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/a-treatise-on-agency-and-goals.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I may have ADHD to some degree, I’m not sure. These thoughts came to me today when considering my side business.</p>
<hr>
<section id="a-treatise-on-desire-uncertainty-commitment-and-execution-toward-a-goal." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-treatise-on-desire-uncertainty-commitment-and-execution-toward-a-goal.">A treatise on desire, uncertainty, commitment, and execution toward a goal.</h2>
<p>Descartes proposed that if you pick a direction and walk in a straight line you’ll eventually leave the forest. This assumes you want to leave the forest.</p>
<p>A desire is a persistent yearning. Desires take root and, when nurtured, become reality.</p>
<p>An achieved desire is a blend of hope, faith, and charity. A hope (goal) is the edge of the forest. Walking is faith (belief + action). Charity is long suffering and persistence - the ability to maintain hope and faith.</p>
<p>A hope is envisioned or observed. If observed, there is believed certainty in achievement, with uncertainty in the path. An envisioned hope has uncertainty in both the path and the outcome. You might die trying. Envisioned hopes are impossible only when the path is not made clear. Thought makes the path clear.</p>
<p>A clear path is a plan. A plan is a sequence of informed choices and actions leading towards a goal, a consequence. A causal effect. Reconnaissance is the finite time and energy spent collecting information. Reason invites spending time and energy proportional to the cost or impact of the plan and goal. Judgment determines which choices and actions are taken.</p>
<p>Commitment is recognizing many roads lead to Rome, and only one of them can be walked to actually get there.</p>
<p>Luck is unknown things. Some things could have been known with more reconnaissance. Other things could never have been known or anticipated. Luck either enables or disables the path. Luck happens post plan, post deliberation. It’s the unknown distance between you and the forest’s edge. Hindsight bias is the present mind’s ability to mistakenly believe uncertainty was always certain. “I should have known” is an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Enabling luck makes possible the goal. Disabling luck makes difficult the goal, perhaps impossible. Impossible is usually a state of mind or the laws of physics, but usually never both.</p>
<p>Tilt is the mist of blindness caused by the presence of luck. Tilt distracts from information and commitment, a bias caused by observed outcomes that were previously uncertain.</p>
<p>Commitment is time and energy. Time is measured by rotations of the earth or attempts made. Energy is measured by willingness to roll the dice again.</p>
<p>Commitment is also reconnaissance. More actions, more information. Ignorance is choosing not to see the information. Stubbornness is seeing it, and maintaining the status quo for thrill of ego. Humility is hunger for more information.</p>
<p>Uncertainty invites fear and worry. Perceived time spent amplifies fear and worry. Uncertainty in the path. Uncertainty in the destination, etc.</p>
<p>A plan is the process of committing to something knowing that hindsight bias creeps in with each step. The plan mitigates the drag of hindsight bias.</p>
<p>Fear and anxiety are compounded when accomplishment doesn’t happen within perceived time. Human nature is to lose all track of time when in a task, so time should be planned for. Time to evaluate the plan and assess new information should also be decided in the plan.</p>
<p>Commitment to the plan is a recognition of the infallibility of human emotion. Judgment is evaluating if the plan could be improved, and the plan includes time/effort-base checkpoints for evaluation. Commitment is the recognition that, while the direction you’re heading may not be the right one, (shortest path between you and the edge of the forest which you can’t know at onset), walkikg straight is better than circling from changing direction multiple times. Straight lines are incapable of not exiting. Circles may exit but are capable of not exiting.</p>
<p>If new information overrides understood information at the time of the plan, and changes the decision that would have been made given the circumstances at the time of the plan, then wisdom and humility is the ability to change direction despite how many miles walked (sunk cost).</p>
<p>Walking in a straight line in business is “walking in accordance to the plan”. The time spent deliberating the plan should be proportional to the costs and benefits of the action, which requires judgment. Inspiration is praying that God will guide you and enable your plan.</p>
<p>Arrogance is believing you have infinite energy and time. Optimism is appreciating that any mile walked strengthens your legs, that the direction you chose may not match the imagined ideal. Self awareness is appreciating that the human mind is capable of any imagination, and few imaginations consider accurately all costs or benefits of reality. Imaginations are powerful, but can cause circling, and are most powerful during the plan. After the plan, use imagination to accomplish it. Before the plan, use imagination to design it. But don’t use imagination during the plan to redesign it, I.e, avoid circling.</p>
<p>Action gets stuff done.</p>

  <title>New business Checklist</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Getting paid is easy. Getting paid the right way is harder.</p>
<p>You don’t need to have an LLC.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get an address. You can use your own, but safer to pay $10/mo for a postal box. I use Ipostal.com</li>
<li>File an LLC. Use Incfile. Get it done right if you’re doing this business with a partner.</li>
<li>Using the EIN, go register a small business bank account. I chose Chase only because they do</li>
<li>Create a website.</li>
<li>Accounting software (Freshbooks)</li>
<li>On Freshbooks you can connect to strip. You need a website first.</li>
<li>Get an email provider. (Outlook or Google) You don’t need a website to do email, but you do need a domain. You can have anyone host your website, anyone register your name, and anyone do your email. But the company that registers your url will be the place where you manage your DNS records to set up your email.</li>
<li>Track your expenses separately. They’re all a tax write off.
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a separate credit card, perhaps a small business credit card, for just this purpose.</li>
</ol></li>
<li></li>
</ol>

<p>Danny:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove someone’s “gut” and they give better predictions</li>
<li>Ask not what is true, but what it’s true of.</li>
<li>Simple algorithms &gt; judgment on average.</li>
<li>Don’t focus on the recruits, but on the interviewers - remove their biases.</li>
<li>If mueller lyar lines can deceive us in something so simple, how can we comprehend the complex?
<ul>
<li><a href="../book-review/thinking-fast-and-slow.html">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> → if you can recognize it you can avoid being deceived.</li>
<li>→ data science. “Oh nice result!” → nope it’s just an illusion. Learn to recognize.</li>
<li>→ experts can recognize. ⇋</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Amos:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s the little decisions that are the most revealing because the big ones are mostly luck. The systematic decisions. The consistent ones.</li>
<li>the nice thing about urgent things is if you wait long enough they’re no longer urgent.</li>

  <title>Pinball Loss</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/pinball-loss.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I just learned about Pinball Loss: <a href="https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/how-i-made-peace-with-quantile-regression">How I made peace with quantile regression</a></p>
<p>Essentially, it’s a loss function that penalizes over vs under predictions. It can be used to help perform quantile regression and bias the predictions over or under the mean (which is what quantile regression does).</p>

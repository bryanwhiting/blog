  <title>Easiest ways to learn something</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The easiest ways to learn how do to something better:</p>
<ul>
<li>do something for the first time</li>
<li>Do something 1000 times. You get better over time.</li>
<li>Mess up doing something: this is how you realize your initial assumptions were wrong and you overcome beginners luck.</li>
<li>Do something fast: You see what you do more efficiently.</li>
<li>Do the same thing with new inputs: serve a new customer, try on new shoes for walking.</li>
<li>Watch someone do the same thing you’ve done 50 times: you have all the context and you’re primed to observe new ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is life experience, it turns out. Doing a lot of stuff on repeat, watching others do it, mess up doing it, or do it slightly differently…</p>

  <title>Reading Charts Every Week</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/reading-charts-every-week.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The hardest thing about looking at charts is the “nothings changed” bias our minds are prone to. It requires a ton of energy to look at each chart with new eyes every time.</p>
<p>This is actually where AI can help point out things. But then there’s the fatigue of starting to ignore AI read outs.</p>
<p>Then move to anomaly detection</p>
<p>But what if there are always a ton of anomalies.</p>
<p>Then go back and make sure you read every chart. Every week.</p>

  <title>Tracing</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/tracing.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“Tell her you traced that”</p>
<p>my daughter had just asked me if I drew this. I said yes. But I omitted some details.</p>
<p>What does it matter I traced it? I wanted a picture that didn’t look like two potatos.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the question of: “did you draw that” and “did you actually write that” will perhaps become more relevant.</p>
<p>I’ve never coded without using Google. Now I don’t code without AI. Is that cheating? Am I tracing??</p>
<p>Ultimately, nobody cares how it was made. Just that it was made to spec.</p>
<p>Similarly, a relative likes to bow hunt. Why? It’s more fun than a rifle. More of a challenge.</p>
<p>I didn’t want a challenge. I wanted a better drawing. So I traced.</p>
<p>In the future, we’ll still write “by hand”. But not to create a great product. But because it’s meaningful to experience as a human.</p>

  <title>Expertise is knowing what to do when things go wrong</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Expertise isn’t knowing how to do something right. It’s knowing how to make it right when things go wrong.</p>
<p>I shadowed a dentist for a week as a hygienist. I was pretty confident by the end that filling a cavity was actually the pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>But what about that one time you hit a nerve? Or take too much off? Or…or…</p>

  <title>Just a few lines of code</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Anytime anyone tells you “it’s been simplified to a few lines of code”, that always means it’s several thousand lines of code hidden in the closet. You inherit both when using the solution with just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>Some things can’t easily be abstracted.</p>

  <title>How I will vote</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/how-i-will-vote.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2016 I voted independent with the hope that I could have neither Trump nor Hilary. I lived in Virginia, a somewhat swing state, and had a chance of creating an electoral college lock.</p>
<p>In 2020 I voted independent because I wanted to give a third party a viable say, and I knew that a democrat would earn my delegate votes anyway. (Californian republicans have a say in the house, not the senate or the Oval Office.) a state that has only voted <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/California">Democrat since 1988</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img2024-09-01-2109-republican-b.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This is interesting because they’ve had multiple tepiblican</p>

  <title>Don’t trust a cloud provider</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/dont-trust-a-cloud-provider.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Never trust a cloud provider to do compute for you, like AmazonForecast. (Or LLM tuning?)</p>
<p>Amazon will charge $1440, take 4.1 hours, and have an accuracy 3x worse than using an open source Nixtla, which cost $1.20, took 15 minutes and had an accuracy metric 1/3 the Amazon service offered (lower accuracy is good in this case.)</p>
<p>Where else are cloud providers ripping you off?</p>

  <title>Chicken Nugget A B testing</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/chicken-nugget-a-b-testing.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Why cutting chicken nuggets for my 2y old is an optimization problem, and how social media companies use these principles:</p>
<p>Objective: maximize my 2 year olds caloric intake</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inputs: chicken nugget size.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut two nuggets four ways: 8 pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut two nuggets two ways: 4 pieces.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Will the kid eat 5 small pieces or 3 big ones?</p>
<p>On one hand, he eats 62.5% of nuggets. On the other, 75%. But maybe he only eats two halves - that drops him to 50% consumption.</p>
<hr>
<p>What gets you watching one more YouTube, one more Spotify song, one more TikTok? One more LinkedIn post?</p>
<p>Do people sign off after 5 posts? One post? If we slide a video into the fifth spot after the first four posts, do they engage? If they engage with the video do they come back tomorrow or in a week?</p>
<p>Everything’s an optimization. Even cutting nuggets. Your mind just does this subconsciously.</p>

<p>I use these seven steps to the scientific method every single day:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What’s the problem?</li>
<li>Hypothesis: What’s the believed answer?</li>
<li>Metrics: how do I measure with data?</li>
<li>Methods: how do I test the belief?</li>
<li>Findings: what are the unemotional facts?</li>
<li>Discussion: what are my opinions about the findings? (These are usually more hypotheses.)</li>
<li>Next steps: self explanatory 🤣</li>
</ol>
<p>It helps me think more clearly when diving into data! Hope it helps.</p>

  <title>This is an A/B test</title>

<p>Dude. You’re being experimented on. Aren’t you a little bit curious how it works?</p>
<p>Bruh, they’re experimenting on you. Yes you. Now. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p>Im A/B testing out some clickbait, let’s see if it works 👇👇</p>
<p>This post is not AI generated. I wrote it. But I’m testing an idea: what if I write and publish two posts at the exact same time but with different clickbait hooks? Same content (what I’m writing here.)</p>
<p>Hypothesis: I’m guessing LinkedIn will naturally favor one post over the other. Hard to know which.</p>
<p>A/B testing is all about this every day. Newspapers play with their bylines. Search engines play with their titles. Ad copy is all one massive experiment to see what clicks the most.</p>
<p>So drop a like if you like A/B tests. And keep an eye out for my other identical post, launched at 10am on Tuesday PST. Let’s see which gets the more impressions on LinkedIn!</p>
<p>Here are the two intros:</p>

  <title>Data science structure</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/data-science-structure.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Over my career I’ve thought a lot about “where should a data scientist sit in an org?” 👇 5 lessons from what I’ve learned after working in 6 very different companies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>DS under an MBA: maybe okay, probably bound for failure.</li>
<li>DS under the PM: def bound for failure.</li>
<li>DS under the DS: good for the junior in the short term.</li>
<li>DS under Eng: good.</li>
<li>DS under a people manager, but works closely integrated team with a DS-experiences tech lead: best.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interdisciplinary teams do the best work. It maximizes labor efficiency to have engineers, PMs, and DS’s working on the same problem but doing different things.</p>
<p>When you federate DS, they don’t care as much about what they’re working on. The incentives are off.</p>
<p>When a DS works for a PM the PM will make wild assumptions about what they should do. PMs oversimplify problems and DS find that unsatisfying.</p>
<p>DS reporting to DS means you throw stuff over the fence and the Eng do the real work. And the Eng don’t capture all the nuance the DS would like to implement.</p>
<p>DS reporting to business types is unfulfilling because DS love technical stuff.</p>
<p>best scenario? Have a DS work in a pod with experienced tech leads. DS reports (HR purposes) to someone outside of the team who can give them guidance but is incapable of micromanaging them.</p>

  <title>Forget Pythonic. Write code that works</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/forget-pythonic-write-code-that-works.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For the Python nerds: I’ve seen data scientists bashing notebooks for years. I was one of them.</p>
<p>Then I learned yesterday about nbdev and how Jeremy Howard and folks at Nixtla are building production grade software using…notebooks.</p>
<p>I was taken aback by Jeremy’s YouTube “I don’t write code like most Python programmers, but I have a reason for how I write it”.</p>
<p>I was also shocked how easy it was to read Nixtla’s documentation and source code. Shouldn’t that be the goal??</p>
<p>Unit tests at the bottom of the Python files where the functions are defined. Wait…that makes a ton of sense.</p>
<p>Wirh nbdev there’s no major emphasis on pep8. No black formatting. No like wrap at 80 characters.</p>
<p>And I realized: we put so much emphasis on convention and doing what others are doing.</p>
<p>I’m not saying pep8 or black are wrong. I like them. But Python is just a language. Don’t get sucked into “being pythonic”. If the code works, and it creates value, it serves its purpose.</p>
<p>I come from R where there are so many “dialects”. Compare base R vs the tidyverse. Worlds apart in how they build and test their code.</p>
<p>So…make your own dialect. Just don’t waste time trying to keep up with all the formatters and linters out there. Because who cares? It’s your code.</p>
<p>It’s okay to have you or your team have your own style.</p>

  <title>10 steps to optimize anything</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/10-steps-to-optimize-anything.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I love-hate goal setting. Here are 10 steps I often fail at in how I try to breakdown and achieve goals, but hey, this is LinkedIn so I’ll share…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Objective: Define your “where you are going” and your “why”.</li>
<li>Principles: Decide what’s worth it in how you pursue your where/why.</li>
<li>Key Result: Measure the goal numerically 1-3 ways. Too many is too confusing.</li>
<li>KR-Drivers: Identify the key drivers that affect the goal.</li>
<li>Hypothesize: Use data/intuition to guess what will drive increases in KR-drivers.</li>
<li>Experiment: Try 2 approaches, manipulate the drivers in big or minor ways.</li>
<li>Track: Measure/track/Log what’s needed to measure if your hypothesis was valid or rejected.</li>
<li>Analyze: make minor tweaks in the drivers and measure statistically significant changes.</li>
<li>Conclude: Which direction will increase your KR. Consider alternate paths if the experiment didn’t yield good results.</li>
<li>Periodic Evaluation: At a pre-determined cadence (1 wk, 6 wk, quarter), choose if your KR is helping you achieve your objective.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>A few lessons learned as a professional experimenter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking is not the key result. Don’t confuse them. Too many people&nbsp;&nbsp;track habits for no reason (I’m guilty of this 100%)</li>
<li>KR’s have no purpose if you don’t have an objective. You want 100k ffollowers? 100k revenue? They don’t mean anything until you know what you’re going to do with it. More fame/money doesn’t equal more life satisfaction. Lots of unhappy/depressed rich/famous people.</li>
<li>“Experimentation” early into defining a product should be massive swings. Find the “lowest hanging fruit”, make the biggest changes.</li>
<li>Have principles to guide your KR’s. If you don’t</li>
<li>Have Anti-KR’s - things you won’t do. This is the hardest. If you have 10 KR’s, perhaps KR’s 2-10 should be all anti-KR’s. Otherwise, you’ll get distracted on 2 despite you knowing 1 is most important.</li>
<li>A rising tide lifts all ships: By improving one KR, you may be sacrificing improving another. But more likely you’ll actually improve all KR’s, because they’re usually correlated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy Example: “I want to be healthier”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Objective: I want more energy to be able to devote it to my kids.</p></li>
<li><p>Principles:&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>I will not hurt my body by doing unnecessary XYZ</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not going to kill myself. I’m going to keep this simple.</p></li>
<li><p>KR:&nbsp;&nbsp;(Write down 10, pick the one that will obviate the rest)</p></li>
<li><p>Gain 10 lbs of muscle</p></li>
<li><p>Eat 100g of protein a day</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep 8 hours a day</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate 20 minutes a day</p></li>
<li><p>KR-drivers for gaining 10 lbs of muscle:</p></li>
<li><p>Lift weights</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on quads</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on upper body</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesize: If I go to the gym for 10 minutes for 28 days and do 30 exercises a day, I’ll gain muscle.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment: I’ll keep my diet the same - including the popcorn. I’ll focus my mental energy on clearing my calendar and getting out the door to the gym. The “control” experiment is what I’ve done the last 28 days…not worked out 🤣</p></li>
<li><p>Track:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Day 1: I’ll weight myself, write a journal about how I feel. Perhaps ask myself some questions.</li>
<li>Did I go to the gym for 10 minutes? I’ll keep a piece of paper and a pen taped to my mirror or on my nightstand. Checkbox. Don’t track anything else. This is my one focus right now.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Analyze: on day 28, I’ll weigh myself again.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Conclude: Did this 28-day challenge change how I felt? Be honest: it might not. Perhaps I can get on my bike, or hike, or do pushups every day instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodic evaluation: every 2 months I’ll investigate how my energy is.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>your goal isn’t to gain/lose weight. Your goal is to feel better about your health. Your key result is a number on a scale going up/down.</p>

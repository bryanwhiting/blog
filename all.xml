  <title>The Power of a Good Book</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Last night I went to a tapas style restaurant. I got 5 things. Then we opted for one more: battered cod tacos. Our taste buds rewarded us. That’s why we came.</p>
<p>Before that I was telling my wife, “I don’t see why my friend didn’t like the sushi. It’s fine. I just don’t know how to evaluate if something is worth it or not. Because it’s tasty, I’d recommend it…” This came off the heels of multiple times recently where I’ve gone out with people who are foodies that criticize the meal I’m enjoying and I’m left wondering: am I a food plebe?</p>
<p>Experiencing this last night was poignant. The whole meal was good. Not bad. Just good.</p>
<p>Then came the fish tacos.</p>
<p>That’s how it is with reading. You need to read a lot before the good and the bad start filtering out.</p>
<p>And like fish tacos, maybe there are even better ones out there, but I needed this one to point me in the direction of what’s possible.</p>
<p>And to some degree, there’s a dulling of sensitivities. If you haven’t read good literature in a long while perhaps you assume it’s all fine and “why <em>not</em> finish this book?”</p>
<p>But this year I’m trying to read many authors across many genres to tackle just that: find the books I really enjoy reading. And then ask myself, “why? What was special there?” So that I know what to look for next.</p>
<p>Last night I began <a href="../book-review/the-old-man-and-the-sea.html">The Old Man and the Sea</a> and it was a fish taco moment. I don’t know how I’ve avoided this book so long. I’m sure I read it in like sixth grade, but does that even count? And why have I largely avoided fiction for most of my adult life? I suppose having studied something very technical in college it pushed me to stop using that side of my brain. But getting back to good books, written with such depth and creative imagination, renew me with an awareness of the dullness of business books I’ve been dwelling in.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">An Old Man and His Tacos</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And now, for ChatGPT to answer the prompt: “in the style of Ernest Hemingway, write three paragraphs about a man eating fish tacos”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the style of Ernest Hemingway, characterized by his terse and direct prose, the tale unfolds on a weathered pier stretching into the gray, restless sea. The man, solitary and rugged, sits at the edge where the wood meets the water, a plate of fish tacos beside him. His hands, calloused and strong, deftly assemble the tacos with an economy of movement that speaks of a life shaped by necessity rather than choice. The fish, freshly caught, bears the scent of the ocean, a fragrance as old as time, mingling with the sharp tang of lime and cilantro.</p>
<p>Around him, the world seems to hold its breath, the only sounds are the soft lapping of waves against the pilings and the distant cries of gulls, wheeling like specters in the overcast sky. He bites into a taco, the crispness of the tortilla giving way to the tender fish within, a simplicity that belies the depth of flavors. There’s a harmony here, between man and nature, a momentary peace found in the act of eating, of sustaining oneself with the bounty of the sea.</p>
<p>As he eats, his gaze is drawn to the horizon, where the gray of the sea blends indistinguishably with the sky. There’s a contemplation in his eyes, a man adrift in his thoughts as he is in life, finding solace in the simple pleasure of a meal. The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself—uncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction. In this moment, on this pier, the man and the sea are one, their stories intertwined in the quiet, unspoken understanding that life, in all its forms, is a series of solitary moments shared with the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dang…“life shaped by necessity rather than choice” and “The tacos, humble yet fulfilling, become a metaphor for existence itself—uncomplicated in its components, yet profound in its satisfaction.” I’m glad Ernest is somewhere in there, AI. You may have a soul after all.</p>

<p>I have not used it. Just thought it’s cool. # commentary I don’t see why Open AI can’t build something like this, but they’re focused on much higher value problems such as solving enterprise hunger.</p>
<p>So we’ll see niche tools like this that pop up and solve the needs of a few - satisfying the developer costs of some indie programmers. thinking of Innovators Dilemma, there’s just not enough juice in this lemon for Open AI to squeeze, but plenty for a small fish.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Compliments</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/compliments.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m grateful for compliments. The ones I receive and the ones I can give.</p>
<p>The cheapest thing you can give someone is a compliment. Yet it may be the most valuable gift to be given.</p>
<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion.html">Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</a> which talks about “reciprocity”. People feel someone obligated to help you when you give them something, even if it’s nominal. Isn’t a compliment a gift?</p>
<p><a href="../book-review/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.html">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> also discusses the benefits of being kind, and putting yourself in another’s shoes. Kindness far exceeds the benefits of criticism. A compliment is a way to think about what that person may want to hear and to give them that. Not in an insincere way, but in a sincere way.</p>
<p>People act how they want to be treated. If they show up to play basketball they want to be told they’re good at basketball. If they work on a task for you, it’s because they want to be told they’re good at that task. It doesn’t hurt to be nice. To give a compliment. So give away.</p>
<p>Being human is recognizing what other people aspire for and recognize that goodness in them. So notice. Notice what they’re after. Then give. Give freely, for so did He (<a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.html">Bread given freely, like His life</a>).</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 19 - Yieldeth Himself</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-19-yieldeth-himself.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>On Sunday I was thinking about <a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-given-freely-like-his-life.html">Bread given freely, like His life</a>. It’s powerful to read this verse today:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, <strong>yieldeth himself</strong>, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-19.10">1 Nephi 19.10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also <a href="../sacrament-symbols/bread-in-the-oven.html">Bread in the Oven</a> post touches here.</p>
<p>He gave His life freely. He yielded himself.</p>
<p>So much doctrine is packed in this one verse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ had all power. He was a deity.</li>
<li>He obeyed the father.</li>
<li>He fulfilled prophesy.</li>
<li>He was the God of Abraham. He is distinct from the Father.</li>
<li>It was prophesied he would resurrect. Prophets in America knew this.</li>
<li>There is a space between death and the resurrection. Christ lived in that space for 3 days.</li>
<li>There are prophets who have testified of the Lord whom we don’t have records from.</li>
<li>Jesus delivered the Israelites. → the Israelites then delivered him unto the cross.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-cattle-ranch-gate.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="The Lord is the rancher. He controls the gate. He delivers. We’re just wandering without him"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Every scripture in the Book of Mormon can contain some or many truths about the Savior. There’s always something to learn.</p>
<p>Humility is the process of putting the Lord’s wishes above my own, as He put the Father’s wishes above perhaps his own (yet they are one).</p>

<p>Storytelling - I love how he speaks a thought, then follows up with reality. Like “come on, catch the hook” “but the hook did not catch” - Repetitive words used in new ways evoke new meaning - Keep it simple. <a href="../posts/mark-cuban-mogul-support.html">Mark Cuban Mogul Support</a> - don’t use a big word when a simpler one will do. He evokes strong emotion without much fanciful language. - Your mind fills in the blanks. He encodes the intuition of 50 years of fishing in plain words. “I’ve got enough line…” is not a calculation. <a href="../book-review/wool.html">Wool</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> are much more</p>
<p>2024-02-01 - first you borrow. Then you beg. - “This too was a fiction” - “Relics of his wife” - he waits to reveal his wife. - I was born for this. - He could think of nothing except endure <img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/book-the-old-man-and-the-sea.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="The Old Man and The Sea"></p>

  <title>Export your Libby Timeline to Obsidian</title>

<p>I love reading and I love writing. Both are integral parts of learning. The reading to receive new ideas, the writing to cement those ideas to something.</p>
<p>As I stood up my blog I wondered how to get past books on here. There’s a way!</p>
<p>I now use Audible and Spotify audiobooks, but most of my past reads come from Libby.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Libby</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Here’s how you do it using Python:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open Libby app and figure out how to export your timeline. Somewhere in settings. It’ll produce a CSV.</li>
<li>Go through that CSV and creat a column “read” that identified the ones you actually began (sigh…so many books I placed holds on but never read….)</li>
<li>Run this python script and it’ll create an obsidian markdown file for each. Tweak it to match your preferences. I personally use <code>quarto</code> to blog so I have a naming convention for the files and metadata.</li>
<li>Or! Just ask ChatGPT to do this for you lol.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
import os
import zipfile
import re

# Load the provided spreadsheet using pandas
file_path = "~/Downloads/libbytimeline-activities.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Parse the timestamp into the format yyyy-mm-dd and rename the column to 'date'
df["timestamp_raw"] = df["timestamp"]
df["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"], format="%m/%d/%y %H:%M")
# create a stringed date
df["date"] = df["timestamp"].dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

df[["date", "timestamp_raw"]]

# Custom column: Filter rows where read == 1 (went through spreadsheet to filter out those I had borrowed but never read).
df = df[df["read"] == 1]

# De-duplicate by title, keeping the most recent record (sorted by date)
df = df.sort_values("timestamp", ascending=False).drop_duplicates("title")

# Create a new column 'created' with today's date in yyyy-mm-dd format
today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
df["created"] = today

# Create a new column 'date-finished' that's the timestamp's date + 21 days
df["date-finished"] = (df["timestamp"] + timedelta(days=21)).dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Prepare for markdown file creation
output_directory = os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/markdown_files")
os.makedirs(output_directory, exist_ok=True)

# Loop through each item in the dataframe and create a markdown file
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    markdown_content = f"""

<p>Just played some ball tonight. Not sure who invented this game, but it’s really come a long way.</p>
<p>The cool thing is that you can be horrible at shooting and still find a way to contribute. There are a lot of skills and abilities that make a good team.</p>
<p>I play with the same 20 guys, and it’s amazing how different combinations of 5 people play so differently. The flow, the passing, the defense - it all varies with who’ve you got on the court. And that’s what makes it fun. Sometimes you contribute more. Sometimes less.</p>

<p>I’ve played it my whole life, though never well. I played in rec leagues in college. In rec leagues in high school. And now with a bunch of folks who just love the game. And that’s why it’s fun: it brings people together.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 18 - The Power of Prayer</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Nephi has two powerful verses about prayer:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-18.3">1 Nephi 18.3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we pray often, we are shown great things. And then after he’s tied up and being beaten by his brothers. According to what he wrote, this is the first thing he did when he was released:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-18.21">1 Nephi 18.21</a></p>
</blockquote>

  <title>Influence The Psychology of Persuasion</title>

<p>2024-01-30 - Ackerman method from <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> applies to the concept of anchoring. Better to anchor at $2 then tell them $200 off than play a joke at $10000 but only offer $200. - Reciprocity - the small things compound over time. Give more than you expect to get. - “Because”. Giving reasons is persuasive, that word is a trigger.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 17 - He will strengthen us</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Consider how the Lord provided for Nephi and his people</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.<br>
And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he <strong>doth nourish them, and strengthen them</strong>, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-17.2-3">1 Nephi 17.2–3</a></p>

<p>The Lord intends to strengthen me to overcome the trials ahead, not to take them away. The purpose of the life is to be strengthen. Whenever we feel overwhelmed, we can take those things to the Lord.</p>

  <title>1 Nephi 16 - Christ Guides us in Unique Ways</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/1-nephi-16-christ-guides-us.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Lehi had a humbling experience as he was complaining at how hard the journey was:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-16.25">1 Nephi 16.25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Lord chastened Lehi, he pointed Lehi to the Liahona for next steps:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-16.26">1 Nephi 16.26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord was <em>already</em> speaking to Lehi, so why did he tell Lehi to look at the Liahona? Why not just tell him what next to do?</p>
<p>An interesting thing happened with the Brother of Jared as well:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. <strong>And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.14">Ether 2.14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-christ-standing-brother-of-jared.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Christ standing with the Brother of Jared in a cloud</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In this case, the Lord just told him the next steps: “Go to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built.” (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.16">Ether 2.16</a>)</p>
<p>Why did Lehi get a compass, and the Jaredites not? Why did the Lord point Lehi to get his answers from the compass, but just told brother of Jared what next to do?</p>
<p>Well, I’m sure it’s not so black and white. But the fact that there <em>is</em> a <em>black</em> and a <em>white</em> way in which the Lord teaches us is my point.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord tells us what to do (black). Sometimes he reminds us of the things he’s already given us (white). He reminds us of words from the scriptures. He reminds us of past prayers. He reminds us to pray.</p>
<p>And if we look more closely, we actually <em>do</em> see a similarity between Brother of Jared and Lehi because they “built barges after the manner which they <strong>had</strong> built, according to the instructions of the Lord.” (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.16">Ether 2.16</a>)</p>
<p>Meaning: they already had the answer and the Lord just had to remind them.</p>
<p>Meaning: their liahona was the fact that they already had directions from the Lord.</p>
<p>Let’s go back a little. Earlier in Jaredite journey, they were being very deliberately lead by the Lord:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and <strong>gave directions whither they should travel.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.5">Ether 2.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but the Lord gave them instructions on how to build a barge:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and <strong>did build barges</strong>, in which <strong>they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord.</strong> <a href="../scriptures/ether-2.6">Ether 2.6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Lehi and Brother of Jared were both pointed in the direction they should go. But the Lord teaches them each in their own way. For Lehi he gives him a Liahona and tells him to read the words therein. This is a physical tool, kind of like the Book of Mormon and other scripture. We should not be surprised if sometimes the Lord tells us “go to the scriptures, I will answer your question there” or “listen to general conference”. The Lord often points us to places where He’ll speak to us, giving us opportunities to show our faith and do our part.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes he may guide us by the hand and show us the way to go. He may directly just tell us to go one way. This is another way of His for interacting with us.</p>
<p>And interestingly, he later told brother of Jared “remember those barges I gave you four years ago? Rebuild more.” He didn’t necessarily give them more designs but reminded the Jaredites of how he had already guided them.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>There is power in remembering the things the Lord has already done for us. We shouldn’t always seek new signs. We should seek to remember. And in remembering, we’re lead anew.</p>
<section id="what-i-learned" class="level1">
<h1>What I Learned</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Lord guides the same person in different ways</li>
<li>He guides two people in the same circumstance in different ways</li>
<li>He asks us to remember</li>
<li>If we’ve embarked on the journey, even if we stumble, he’ll lovingly chastise us to remember the Way</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>I take solice in that He wants to guide me personally. He may ask me to read my scriptures. He may remind me of a past time. He may give me specific instructions. He may just expect me to walk or build and do the thing I’m supposed to do. Keep going until you receive further instruction.</p>
<p>He’s also actually heavily involved in the details it seems. We may wander lost (Israelites) or be caught relaxing for four years on the beach (Jaredites), but He’s still very heavily involved. I can trust He loves me and wants to guide me.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Rescue Workers</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/rescue-workers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just read a book about the true “heroes” of this world with my kids. It illustrated the many perils that members of the coast guard, police department, fire department, and health care workers and such face.</p>
<p>I think about the souls who lost their lives trying to save victims of 9/11. I think about someone close to me who was flown on a helicopter to another hospital and saved there. I think about a friend in high school who was carted away in an ambulance because they collapsed right on the ground during the middle of a game.</p>
<p>We have an amazing response team in America. The fact that anyone can pick up their phone and dial 3 numbers and get help within 5 minutes from people trained to help is pretty incredible. It’s a safety net we don’t appreciate until we need it. And many in the world live without it.</p>

<p>And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree? 24 And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and <strong>would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness</strong>, to lead them away to destruction. 25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things. <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-15.23-25">1 Nephi 15.23–25</a></p>

<p>10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; <a href="../scriptures/ephesians-6.10-18">Ephesians 6.10–18</a></p>

  <title>Air Canada’s failed AI/-generated Refund Policy</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/air-canadas-failed-ai-generated-refund-policy.html</link>

<p>In recent news, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/">Air Canada must honor refund policy invented by airline’s chatbot | Ars Technica</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, trollers were able to convince the chatbot to agree to selling them a car for $1. <a href="https://the-decoder.com/people-buy-brand-new-chevrolets-for-1-from-a-chatgpt-chatbot/">People buy brand-new Chevrolets for $1 from a ChatGPT chatbot</a>. It’s possible some of these things may have actually been legally binding if someone wanted to sue for it.</p>
<p>Be careful - AI is incredibly hard to control. Open tools exist to attempt impose guardrails, but they’re not perfect: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01822v1">Building Guardrails for Large Language Models</a>.</p>
<p>If we can’t contain today’s AI, can we contain tomorrow’s? This isn’t to be an alarmist, but a pragmatist. Machine learning was used in a lot of wrong ways before it was able to be harnessed for good. The same will likely be true for AI.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I walk downstairs, the kitchen is clean. It’s 7:47 and I know at 8 it’s too late. Now is the time.</p>
<p>My wife opens the pantry, pulls out the bowls, mixes some ingredients, and I power wash some dishes. “Will you put this in the oven when it’s ready?” I wait for the beep. It beeps. I plop in the tray, it’s 8:01.</p>
<p>45 minutes later the tray emerges, having fulfilled its purpose. With a clatter on the table, warmth released from the oven and into the kitchen as the pan rested on the stove. Vanilla ice cream emerged from the freezer. Smiles ensued.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - Heaven and Hell in One</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-heaven-and-hell.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>This quote focuses on the dichotomy people feel as they draw closer to Christ. First, they have the desire. Second, they have positive experiences. Third, they doubt their worthiness. Or they wish that all the good things could prevent them from sinning again:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions? 27 And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy? <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.26-27">2 Nephi 4.26–27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-heaven-and-hell.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Heaven and Hell"> # Meaning</p>
<p>The Lord wants us to grow. Sometimes that involves choosing to see the good in an experience.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Board Games</title>

<p>Have you ever pulled out a board game when you’re in a rush?</p>

</div>
<p>No! You pull it out when times are good. When you’ve got time to play. Time to relax. Time to spend with loved ones.</p>
<p>I have memories playing Monopoly with my siblings, or Settlers with my high school friends, or Ticket to Ride more recently.</p>
<p>Games bring people together. I’m grateful for the people who make the games, for the people who create a market for them, and for the friends I can play with.</p>

If you think OpenAI Sora is a creative toy like DALLE, … think again. Sora is a data-driven physics engine. It is a simulation of many worlds, real or fantastical.

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - Love and Despair</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-love-and-despair.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>2 Nephi 4 has two interesting scriptures:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine a human who has felt so much love to describe it as the consuming of his flesh, yet have perhaps a degree of self loathing because of his sins? That he’d like to be happy but he can’t because he knows what he’s done wrong?</p>
<p>I think anyone who is a human can empathize.</p>

<p>Humanity is about building a relationship with God. God is about letting us have agency. He doesn’t expect us to be perfect. He expects us to be human, but guides us to perfection. In some sense He demands it, knowing we’ll fall short.</p>
<p>But we can take comfort in that He will bless us even when we feel undeserving.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Book Club</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/book-club.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Belonging to a book club means you’re old. You’re so old that book clubs are how you have fun. Not playing pickup basketball. Not going to concerts. Not going to the movies. Not going longboarding down the canyon. A book club.</p>
<p>What’s better than any old book club? One with friends that you’ve already done all that other stuff with. One that helps you stay connected. One that inspires new ideas.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the boring book club. Because it’s fun.</p>
<p>It’s also fascinating how everyone picks up different insights. <a href="../book-review/never-split-the-difference.html">Never Split the Difference</a> talks about how hostage negotiators always have one speaker and three or four other people on the call trained to listen to just one thing. It’s because the mind can only process so much information. It’s cool to see how friends pick up on all that different stuff.</p>

  <title>Observable Framework 1.0 vs Quarto</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/observable-framework-vs-quarto.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/">Observable Framework</a> seems like a nice competitor to Quarto. It seems like it has far fewer features, but some other more specialized features.</p>
<p>Things they can both do:</p>
<ul>
<li>use markdown to build websites and apps</li>
<li>Use Observable for plots and reactivity</li>
<li>Load data from any format, using any language</li>
</ul>
<p>Things Quarto excels at:</p>
<ul>
<li>more full featured - can be a blog, a site, etc.</li>
<li>can execute raw R or Python code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things Observable seems better at (based on glancing the docs only):</p>
<ul>
<li>More beautiful</li>
<li>More powerful reactivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like observable is good for people who prefer JavaScript for plotting.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 4 - A Prophecy of Another Branch</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.2">2 Nephi 4.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another powerful reminder of things lost from the Bible, similar to <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-20-baptism-in-the-old-testament.html">1 Nephi 20 - Baptism in the Old Testament</a>. As we look at 2 Nephi 3:5, we see a link to the Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die, and go unto my fathers; and I go down to my grave with joy. The God of my father Jacob be with you, to deliver you out of affliction in the days of your bondage; for the Lord hath visited me, and I have obtained a promise of the Lord, <strong>that out of the fruit of my loins, the Lord God will raise up a righteous branch out of my loins</strong>; and unto thee, whom my father Jacob hath named Israel, a prophet; (not the Messiah who is called Shilo;) and this prophet shall deliver my people out of Egypt in the days of thy bondage. <a href="../scriptures/jst,-genesis-50.24">JST, Genesis 50.24</a></p>

<p>Imagine if for 2000 years the entire world knew about this prophecy and the other things in 50:24-38 # Meaning</p>

<p>I’m reading <a href="../book-review/the-wager.html">The Wager</a> right now and am enthralled and saddened by the horrible circumstances people had to go through on boats back in the day.</p>
<p>Without explorers, we wouldn’t have the knowledge of the world that we have now.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the freedoms we enjoy now, as most of us don’t have to fear about body snatchers coming to take us on a ship and force us to work until we die.</p>
<p>It’s the simple things, I guess…</p>

<p>The Scottish man you’re referring to is Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean, now known as Robinson Crusoe Island, part of the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile. Selkirk lived alone on the island from 1704 to 1709. His story is believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe’s novel “Robinson Crusoe.” Selkirk was a skilled navigator and sailor, and his survival skills, including hunting, gathering, and shelter building, allowed him to survive until he was eventually rescued by an English ship. His experience highlights the human capacity for adaptation and survival in extreme conditions.</p>

  <title>Trajectory and Mindset</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Tony Robbins has said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are. <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/tony-robbins-quotes/">Tony Robbins Quotes, Read These Famous Quotes from Tony Robbins</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book <a href="../book-review/mindset.html">Mindset</a> talks about “fixed” vs “growth” mindsets. My post <a href="../posts/decisions-are-rivers.html">Decisions are Like Hopping on a River Raft</a> - decisions take you down to known endpoints.</p>
<p>Bring those two concepts together and on one hand there’s a trajectory - where you’re capable of going given your decisions (and mindset) and your mindset - how you perceive your circumstances.</p>
<p>Someone recently told me, “It’s not what you go through but how you perceive what you’re going through that matters.”</p>
<p>I believe perception is powerful. Any negative situation can be reframed for a positive. This is mindset.</p>
<p>But the other component is also important: where your circumstances will take you if pursued every day for the next 30 years.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Are you aimed toward the valley or the mountain? Neither is better, but one is probably better to you</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If you’re an extremely happy person but you don’t take action to get out of a minimum wage job, such as spend time on self improvement, you’re going to stay in your minimum wage job (nothing wrong with that, just trying to illustrate a point).</p>
<p>And so, to get what you want out of life you can’t just assume things will get better without any change on your part. You can 1) change your mindset or 2) change your trajectory.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered whether at times in my career I was complacent or not, or whether I was growing doing what I was doing. That’s not a helpful question. Because if you’re too myopic you can miss that you doing your multiplication tables isn’t going to change anyone’s life, but if you can’t do multiplication you can’t be a machine learning engineer.</p>
<p>Most days in our work are steps. Steps towards something.</p>
<p>A spaceman can’t land on the moon unless they build a rocket. They won’t make a rocket unless they choose to land on the moon. And by choosing the moon they’re choosing to <em>not</em> open a Chinese restaurant.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Some roles have upper bounds. Staying at that upper bound isn’t a bad thing. It’s just a thing. Other roles open up different opportunities the longer you stick around, opportunities you won’t get else where perhaps.</p>
<p>So if you’re feeling stuck, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will I be if I stay with this for the next two years?</li>
<li>Is that directionally where I want now to head?</li>
<li>Is there something about my mindset I can change today to help me reframe so that I don’t miss the opportunities already around me?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTH.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Who has more impact? Well as cool as it is to land on the moon, it doesn’t actually do anything practically useful. A restaurant prevents millions of people from starving throughout its existence.↩︎</p></li>

<p><a href="../book-review/beyond-band-of-brothers.html">Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters</a></p>
<p>Leadership from the bayonette. 10 points of leadership by dick winters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strive to be a leader of character, competence, and courage.</li>
<li>Lead from the front. Say, “Follow me!” and then lead the way.</li>
<li>Stay in top physical shape—physical stamina is the root of mental toughness.</li>
<li>Develop your team. If you know your people, are fair in setting realistic goals and expectations, and lead by example, you will develop teamwork.</li>
<li>Delegate responsibility to your subordinates and let them do their jobs. You can’t do a good job if you don’t have a chance to use your imagination or your creativity.</li>
<li>Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don’t wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind.</li>
<li>Remain humble. Don’t worry about who receives the credit. Never let power or authority go to your head.</li>
<li>Take a moment of self-reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself if you did your best.</li>
<li>True satisfaction comes from getting the job done. The key to a successful leader is to earn respect—not because of rank or position, but because you are a leader of character.</li>
<li>Hang tough!—Never, ever give up.</li>

  <title>2 Nephi 25 - We Talk of Christ</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-25-talk-of-christ.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>There is one purpose of a law: to prevent something. Or to ensure something happens. But you really can’t prevent bad things from happening by creating a law because laws are just rules. They define what’s bad.</p>
<p>Consider the law of Moses. It defined what was bad. The Ten Commandments. The ordinances. The many rituals and performances.</p>
<p>But the law was dead.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-25.24">2 Nephi 25.24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the <strong>law hath become dead</strong> unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments. 26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-25.25-26">2 Nephi 25.25–26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forgetting even the spirit of the law, we can just focus on Christ. Just men need no law. # Meaning</p>
<p>The goal of following Christ isn’t to follow him. It’s to become like him. To experience what He experienced. To feel what He felt. The law is dead once you know that and pursue that.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Sun on turf</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/sun-on-turf.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Growing up I played a lot of sports, namely football and lacrosse. One of the best things about playing lacrosse was that it happened in the spring, as the snow was melting and the town warming.</p>
<p>When it was cold in the early season, players would lay close to the artificial turf. It was soft, and retained the heat of the sun. It was sometimes the best way to warm up.</p>
<p>I think of that warmth when I lay in my backyard.</p>

<p>Today I began a new job. It’s a new opportunity to get to know people, to build relationships, and to learn. It’s a chance to change, adapt, and develop.</p>
<p>Each company is its own little world, proving that there’s no one right way to build a business. There are millions of ways.</p>

  <title>A Costly Mistake</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/a-costly-mistake.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>“This is the moment I’ve been waiting for”…until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Several years ago as a budding data scientist I got excited by using a massive compute cluster. This is it. This is when I get to do Big Data Science, baby!</p>
<p>A few thousand dollars later, I realized my hundred-dollar-an-hour cluster wasn’t doing the thing I hired it to do.</p>
<p>My patient manager David Mantilla ssh’d into my cluster and discovered that out of the 64 cores I paid for, I was using only 1.</p>
<p>A good manager goes a long way. He just laughed as I stared in horror at my gross misconduct.</p>
<p>Be kind to the noobs. Because you still are one in many ways…</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It’s the first Sunday of the month, and it’s tradition in the church to publicly bear one’s witness of Christ should they feel inclined. I’ll do that here today…</p>
<section id="the-myth-of-a-messiah" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>The Myth of a Messiah</h1>
<p>I just watched the movie Dune, part 2 last night. Having been slightly captivated by the story, I first watched the Dune Part 1 movie in November and then proceeded to read <a href="../book-review/dune.html">Dune</a> and <a href="../book-review/dune-messiah.html">Dune: Messiah</a> before just seeing Part 2. <a href="../concepts/frank-herbert.html">Frank Herbert</a>’s main ethos in all the interviews he does is to show the horrors that arise when man puts his faith in <em>heroes</em>. He cites Hitler, Roosevelt, Kennedy, and others that seem mythic from human comparison and they’re only mythic because we made them so. That’s the problem. We made them mythic, he might argue.</p>
<p>Frequently, Paul Atreides says things like “these are my followers, but they used to be my friends.” In one moment he asks himself “have I lost you too, Gurney?”, who is his right hand man. He watched himself go from a 15 year old boy to a worshipped messiah. Paul keeps saying “they only see what they were told to see.”</p>
<p>Separately, I recently read <a href="../book-review/the-inklings.html">The Inklings</a>, which explains Tolkien and CS Lewis’s relationship, and how one of the turning points for Lewis in his atheist-to-Christian conversion was the argument over myth.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-the-myth-of-christ.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">The myth of Christ</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Lewis chides Christ as just a myth - something people wanted him to be. A story as old as time.</p>
<p>Tolkien’s viewpoint is of the effect “and why is that a problem?” He posits along the lines that myth is to creation as mathematical theory is to discovering theorems and proofs. It’s the imaginative, creative process to discovering truth. So while Lewis calls Christ a Pagan myth, Tolkien responds as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now the story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God’s myth where the others are men’s myths: i.e.&nbsp;the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call ‘real things’. <a href="https://inspirationdaybook.wordpress.com/2018/06/11/j-r-r-tolkien-c-s-lewis-and-the-idea-of-the-true-myth/">J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and the Idea of the “True Myth” | Russell’s Inspiration Daybook</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s the relationship here?</p>
<p>I’ve often heard Lewis’ argument in my life - “why believe in Christ? it’s just a story that’s been told throughout the centuries.” Dune is one latest example of this, but for millenia there’s been a prophecy of some savior of sorts. It’s all just hogwash.</p>
<p>In Dune, there’s a prophesied messiah of the people. But he’s not deity - he’s the product of selective breeding, excellent combat training, and psychoactive enhancement through drugs. And Paul’s story is also just a story invented by an author. But reflects so many similarities of religious archetypes we hear. Herbert was likely not religious, or perhaps anti-religious, but i can’t find a direct quote.</p>
<p>The point is, where Tolkien espouses the virtues of a savior via Gandalf showing up in the Third Day on the east, and Herbert creating a powerful mortal messiah, we are left to wonder: who is this Christ whom we’ve never met?</p>
<p>Is he an invented story - one I want to desperately believe? A myth concocted to control the masses? # Stories that Lead to Christ</p>
<p>I’m going to diverge for a second and then come back to this point above.</p>
<p>Assume I have an eternal truth to teach you: 1+1=2. Let’s unpack the fact that we have this so deeply memorized that we forget how profound a concept it really is.</p>
<p>Assume I didn’t have numbers to teach you this truth. All I had was leaves from the backyard. One leaf and another leaf is…two leaves? And one blade of grass and another blade of grass is two grass(es)?…nvm. Two blades of grass?</p>
<p>Now imagine I’m a caveman - how do I recognize this story of “1+1=2” without inventing first the concept of “one” and “two”? Can you invent “two” without first inventing “one”? No!</p>
<p>So the caveman first must realize there’s this thing called “one”. Or maybe the caveman called one “oof” and two “doof”, but it’s the same thing. Take some <em>oofs</em> and you get a <em>doof</em>.</p>
<p>Get where I’m going?</p>
<p>The same story said in other languages is still the same story.</p>
<p>Meaning, Christ’s myth told in Tolkien’s fantasy or Herbert’s possibly pseudo heresy can tell the same story.</p>
<p>Let’s unpack some more.</p>
<p>What if that story is not just 1+1=2 but “999+345=1344”. Or the story is “999+344=1345” or “998+347=1343”.</p>
<p>Same concept: two numbers added together to equal a third.</p>
<p>Did you check my math above though?Which statement above is “true”? They’re all just stories. All three of them <em>look</em> correct. But if you check my math, you’ll see that one of those additions is a lie.</p>
<p>Only one of them represents valid truth. The other two aren’t added right, so the story of “+” and “=” doesn’t add up.</p>
<p>In other words, the story of Christ’s can be spun in any direction or it can be told in other forms that appear similar. And they do - lots of religion have a belief in chosen people, a final glory for the “righteous”, etc.</p>
<p>So which is true?</p>
</section>
<section id="the-story-of-christ" class="level1">
<h1>The Story of Christ</h1>
<p>There are many moments in Dune that approximate the story of Christ. But there are crucial components that don’t add up. Paul is a fallible human (though not fallible to his followers). Instead, Christ was actually infallible, regardless of whether he was believed in or not.</p>
<p>He <em>was</em> and <em>is</em> the chosen Messiah. Chosen by Heavenly Father. Chosen to lead. Chosen to redeem. To save. To suffer. To die. To rise. To return.</p>
<p>But why is <em>His</em> story true?</p>
<p>A few years ago, a friend said “the universe opens doors when you ask for it”. I responded “yea, there’s a scripture ‘ask and ye shall receive’”. He responded “that’s great we both come to the same truth but with different belief systems”. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Though I agree that we both got to the same destination and piece of wisdom, my perspective requires in my mind Christ to either have existed or not. Either he was the messiah or not.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-do-i-believe-in-the-messiah" class="level1">
<h1>Why do I believe in the Messiah?</h1>
<p><em>I have a deep and abiding respect for the beliefs of others. I’m merely stating my own, and wish all the privilege of worshipping how, where, or what they may. In that spirit, I want to share my belief.</em></p>
<p>Frankly (pun intended), it doesn’t matter what Tolkien says or what Herbert says. Doesn’t matter what CS Lewis says. These guys were all just humans - like you and me. And none of them can prove or disprove the existence of Christ.</p>
<p>I believe in logic - it’s a form of learning truth. One plus one <em>is</em> two, by definition. Meaning, one plus one is two because that’s how we defined it to be. We have that concept a name.</p>
<p>Also by definition Christ either existed or didn’t exist - regardless of the world’s opinions about His philosophy and theology. It’s simply illogical that He could be both my Messiah but not someone else’s, because someone can choose to believe the earth is flat but it can’t be flat for someone and round for another.</p>
<p>So why am I convinced Jesus Christ is the Messiah of the world He created, the Prince of Peace, the Good Shepherd, the Mediator and Redeemer? Why do I know Him to be real and not just myth?</p>
<p>I can’t describe in words what I feel and know to be true. But I know He lives the same I know one plus one is two.</p>
<p>I’ve read His words in the Bible and <a href="../concepts/the-book-of-mormon-another-testament-of-jesus-christ.html">The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ</a>. I’ve pondered His teachings. And while some say they present a good social contract, they’re more than that. They bring joy because there <em>is</em> light. Treating others with kindness and dignity is more than just a good feeling. It is truth.</p>
<p>Choosing to love one another instead of finding fault isn’t just what a Philosopher taught 32 AD. It’s truth.</p>
<p>Even more than these things though - the reality of Christ isn’t just the presence of good feelings according to following a good teaching, I testify He’s a worker of miracles.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe not only in the good teachings of Christ, but the Living involvement of Him in my life. And this is where I’ll be sparse in my speech, but I’ll recount that miracles have happened in my life in ways only explainable by the existence of a God. Things like praying for guidance and a friend calls me thirty minutes later saying “I don’t know why I felt to call you…” Or, praying for power over the obstacles I face in my life and as I turn to God in prayer a door opens suddenly.</p>
<p>There have been enough of these events that I can only testify He lives. And it’s not just <a href="../concepts/confirmation-bias.html">confirmation bias</a> or a set of coincidences. Because people have seen Him. Have been ministered to by Him. They wrote His teachings. They prophesied of His arrival and the manner of His arrival, and so He did arrive. And what more, they were wrong about what he came to do - he didn’t come to free them from the Romans. He came to free them from themselves.</p>
<p>How else can you know truth other than to be guided to it, and experience it yourself as promised you’d experience it?</p>
<p>He loves all of us. And He is seeking all of our happiness by showing us the way to truth. I believe he loves all religions, even those who don’t believe in Him, because he practices what He preached: love thy neighbor. And I also believe He is the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for a Lord who teaches us all. I’m grateful for His truth taught in stories all around the world in different forms. It’s not evidence of some irrelevant myth. It’s the myth surrounding the incomprehensible truth that He did come, and He did rise on the third day, and He did prepare the way for all of us to live with Him again after this life.</p>

  <title>Implementing Culture</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/implementing-culture.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>One of the most important asset a company wields is its culture.</p>
<p>A culture is hard to define, but you know it when you see it. It’s the collective personality and written and unwritten rules of engagement. Since corporate employment is a social contract of two at-will parties, the culture emerges from the rules of conduct in which the employer is satisfied with continuing employment of the employee.</p>
<p>Values are lip service without implementation. Assume your company has the value “be kind”. Everyone has a different interpretation of what that means to them.</p>
<p>How do you know what a good culture is? People know the values of the culture and can highlight practices examples of it. The culture should live naturally, but also mechanically. Meaning, an employee will be kind while holding the door open for someone (be kind), but also provide explicit growth-oriented feedback.</p>
<p>Signs of a bad culture are therefore evident in the opposite of my definition. Like Lord of the Flies, employees are fending for survival and constantly exploring the boundaries because there are now rules of government. Employees that can’t recount what the values are or demonstrate how the company mechanically employs them are hoping for natural demonstration but get confused when they get mixed signals.</p>
<p>Toxic cultures can achieve financial success. “Toxic” has no concrete definition, but probably reveals people trying to survive on the island rather than thrive in a civilization. It stands, therefore, that a great culture will endure the battles of business, and come out tighter. At some point it won’t matter how bright your people are, how clever your IP is, or how many customers you have: culture is the rudder.</p>

<li>the book is a review of battles in incredible detail. Lots of details on maneuvers. But also shows the desperation. Of the situation.</li>
<li>things that impacted me:

<li>The war breaks some people. They go crazy.</li>
<li>Some shot their own hands to avoid the war</li>
<li>Million dollar</li>
<li>Cover fire.</li>
<li>Looting. Lent up energy. 60+ days no showering. Digging own fox holes deep. Friendly fire and shooting or bayoneting own people. Miracle of a stray bullet not killing you.</li>
<li>Polish with guns behind their back (from Germany) so they’d fight.</li>

  <title>Nothing to Lose</title>
  <dc:creator>Bryan Whiting</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/posts/nothing-to-lose.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There was a moment when I had everything to lose. When I was junior in high school, I was scared I’d be cut from the lacrosse team. There was only one coach and he didn’t have space for everybody. Coach held try outs.</p>
<p>My dad was traveling the week of try outs. I gave him a call. “What if I don’t make the team?”</p>
<p>He waits till I finish. And in a way characteristic of my Dad, he re-emphasizes the question. “<em>What</em> if? You go out there, you play your hardest, you give it your all. The rest is out of your hands. If you get cut, you get cut.”</p>
<p>He didn’t give me false praise or reassurance. He gave me perspective on life. He gave me “nothing to lose.”</p>
<p>I never worked harder in my athletics than that week. I just didn’t want to get cut.</p>
<p>Well, I passed try outs. So did everyone else because it was just a coaching trick to motivate us…but that’s beside the point. But my dad’s advice was never lost on me.</p>
<p>I had low confidence the whole season. Yet my coach took a surprising interest in me. I got playing time as a junior. I was a part time defender.</p>
<p>Little did I know, nor could I ever have imagined as a defender who could barely pass or catch, that in my coach’s last game, I would be sitting on the wrong side of the field. I would be standing, as a defender, right in front of the opposing team’s goalie crease. I’m not quite sure how I got there as the whole season I always sprinted off the field whenever we transitioned from defense to offense.</p>
<p>My coach always yelled at me. “Stay on the field!! It’s a fast break!” But I was always terrified of dropping the ball. I was great at defense. Great at scooping the ball. Great at passing it to an offender. This was my safe place.</p>
<p>Yet here I was, in the final minutes of the game. We had three, they had five. And I’m on the crease. What was I doing here?</p>
<p>My eyes and voice called to my teammate who saw me. My teammate who knew full well I had no intention of actually catching the ball. My teammate who would love to pass it to me if he had any assurance I’d actually catch it. I could see his eyes lock with mine and it only takes 8 years playing a sport to recognize that split-second glance, “Are you going to actually catch this?” My eyes asserted in that moment with my stick extended and ready “I really don’t know. But I’m wide open and I’m on the crease. And you have the defender and not me. So make a call.”</p>
<p>To my surprise he actually passed it. It didn’t have to be a just perfunctory vanity motion to please the coach. Because I’ve called for the ball many times in that wrote script, “oh please pass it I swear it’s worth all our time okay I did my thing now you guys go score because I’m outta here!”</p>
<p>I catch. I turn. I dunk. 4-5.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>I asked Teddy later why he actually passed it to me. “I figured, what the heck? Maybe he’ll catch it!!” We both laughed. He had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>I didn’t know it then, but it was the last goal anybody would score for my coach. It was the last game of the season. The last game of his 35 year career at our school. I was wholly undeserving.</p>
<p>And that’s when you stand most to gain.</p>

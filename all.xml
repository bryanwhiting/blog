  <title>2 Nephi 4 Ask</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-4-ask.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Do you believe in what Nephi came to know?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-4.35">2 Nephi 4.35</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the limitations we can put on the Lord? Here are a few that get me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord wants me to struggle on this one</li>
<li>I don’t want to ask too much</li>
<li>This isn’t that big of a deal. I should pray about more important things instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these are easily contradicted by scriptures. He <em>does</em> want us to struggle but struggle <em>with</em> him and overcome (<a href="../scriptures/1-corinthians-10.13">1 Corinthians 10.13</a>). The Lord wants us to ask for all the blessings He’s capable of giving us (<a href="../scriptures/malachi-3.10">Malachi 3.10</a>), and pour out endless blessings.<sup>1</sup> And lastly, the Lord works by small and simple means (<a href="../scriptures/alma-37.7.html">Alma 37.7</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps instead those three things should be exactly what we pray for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can we struggle on together? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-11.28-30.html">Matthew 11.28–30</a>)</li>
<li>What’s the gift that thou art willing to bless me with? (<a href="../scriptures/matthew-6.8.html">Matthew 6.8</a> )</li>
<li>What’s the smallest piece of help I could possibly ask for? (<a href="../scriptures/ether-2.23">Ether 2.23</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase “ask not amiss” isn’t some indication that a secret code needs to be enacted. That to unlock the heavens, the prayer needs to be offered in the right way at the right time by the right person.</p>
<p>How can you ask amiss? The scriptures teach us. If we’re selfish, seek our own, are puffed up, are easily provoked, want revenge, are greedy, etc. then we’re asking amiss.</p>
<p>But if we’re trying to do our best to be good people and dealing with the challenging responsibilities of being a father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, neighbor, coworker, manager, etc. then we’re just dealing with life.</p>
<p>What is life without these titles? Who doesn’t work? Who doesn’t have someone to care for?</p>
<p>It’s precisely <em>these</em> things that are worthy of our prayers and divine supplication.</p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><a href="../christianity/the-power-of-habitual-prayer.html">The Power of Habitual Prayer</a> is a theme I’ve tried this year. I’ve grown deeply in finding healing by making sure I can have a private place to pray.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen how prayers have been answered in ways I didn’t expect. That something comes unexpectedly and it turns out to be really good. But it wasn’t in the plans.</p>
<p>This is kind of like a personal manna. God delivers. Not expected. But welcomed.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Chicken Sliders</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/chicken-sliders.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I sit down for lunch with a friend. The seat is leather. The booth is warm. The table is glossy with that restaurant-style gloss. And the paper in front of me invites me into a world of tasteful possibilities. The most appealing one is that of the chicken biscuit slider.</p>
<p>Moments later a plate of sliders appears next to a side of truffle fries. The aioli sauce invites a potato’s partnership. The crispy crunch of the fried chicken echos within the cavern of my bite. Eyes close. Satisfaction is earned.</p>

  <title>War Tech</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/war-tech.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://time.com/6691662/ai-ukraine-war-palantir/">Tech Companies Turned Ukraine Into an AI War Lab | TIME</a> details the fight in Ukraine and how Palantir specifically has used it as a testing ground for its digital surveillance and weaponry .</p>

</div>
<p>Obviously war profits defense contractors. This isn’t anything new.</p>
<p>And putting aside beliefs about the war itself, I see the angle here as somewhat inauthentic. It assumes tech is somehow awful.</p>
<p>Arms dealers will always be in the race for selling more arms, whether in peace or in war. But providing services at a discounted rate to defend an invaded ally seems reasonable.</p>
<p>My point: I wish we had more positive tech news. Tech is how we won WWII and almost how we lost it. That same awful WWII tech is how we now power homes with cleaner energy across the world. Some argue it’s how we’ve avoided a WWIII so far because it’s a nuclear war is an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>Tech cannot control the hearts of the men and women who wield it. It can only enable them. May we all strive for wars of words and code not wars of people or weapons, and I actually think tech helps enable that. And hopefully, we can use tech to facilitate misunderstandings and bring people to better diplomacy, ending the need for war. But that’s up to the leaders. Desires for war rage within hearts long before those desires rage within bullets.</p>
<p>As for the main stream media, I’d hope for more nuanced discussions around the uses of tech. Perhaps that’s what it’s alluding to - that war mongers are being fueled by this war.</p>
<p>But then let’s get more diplomatic leaders into office that can manage peace talks. It’s a people problem. Our government shouldn’t be run by the war machine, but by the people. And tech will always enable the people to do what they do best: be human.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Enticement is Agency</title>

  <description><![CDATA[

<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>What’s enticing you right now?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.16">2 Nephi 2.16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you make a decision without being presented at least two options?</p>
<p>If you feel like you made a decision on something, what did you decide and what was the alternative option?</p>
<p>If you’re torn about a decision, why? What’s on the other side?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-enticing-apple.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Why that apple, of all the apples?"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Life is full of enticing things. Sometimes, self defeating thoughts can be enticing. We have a bias towards negativity as humans. But thankfully we always have a choice.</p>
<p>Recognize the behavior. And then find the perhaps less <em>enticing</em> but far more healthy thought pattern.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Gatherings for the Super Bowl</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/gatherings-for-the-super-bowl.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I remember a few fun memories of gathering with friends and family for the Super Bowl while growing up. Often there might be a contest, with random questions like “how long is the opening anthem going to be sung for: longer or shorter than 60s?” Fill out a page of such questions and the person with the most correct answers wins.</p>
<p>Football is a fun sport. I grew up playing it for nearly 12 years - from 2nd grade through senior year. There’s something about playing a sport for that long that you grow an experiential appreciation for what these guys can do.</p>
<p>I don’t follow football much, or any sport for that matter. I don’t have the patience for tracking who goes where. But I love playing it and, when the Super Bowl is on, watching it.</p>
<p>That’s the cool thing - even people who don’t care much for football enjoy watching the game.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Old Movies</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/old-movies.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)">Casablanca (film) - Wikipedia</a> last night for the first time in 10 years. The writing. The angles. The one liners. The implementation of <a href="../posts/the-iceberg-theory-theory-of-omission.html">The Iceberg Theory - Theory of Omission</a>. There are so many cool things.</p>
<p>Great writing is timeless. What connects us to stories are the people that wrote them. The people in them. The Iliad is thousands of years old or whatever. Same with the Bible. They’re both written in language that doesn’t match modern times. But they’re still beautiful because of what they represent.</p>

  <title>Create AI images with Google’s Gemini model</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/create-ai-images-with-googles-gemini-model.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>First seen on: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_i-think-that-google-may-have-come-out-of-ugcPost-7162219043054170112-73pn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios">Ethan Mollick on LinkedIn: I think that Google may have come out of nowhere to have the best LLM… | 19 comments</a></p>
<p><a href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx#">ImageFX</a> Is the tool to generate images with Google’s Gemini. I’ve been a huge fan of using ChatGPT on iOS to get images for this blog. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually good or not. But it’s helped me associate a post with an idea (image), which I think is incredibly helpful for memory retention. So my theory has been: some content is better than no content. The other thought is: better learn now what these tools are and how to use them because you never know where you’re going to be able to take them. They’re like learning how to drive a car: if you can drive, you can go places.</p>
<p>So how does ImageFX compare?</p>

<p>Interestingly, ChatGPT added a camera <em>and</em> had the identical photo inside the camera’s viewport. I’m really not sure how LLMs are that capable, that’s some diffusion inside diffusion.</p>
<p>But winner goes to Gemini here! That nails the image best.</p>
<p>Also, Gemini has an editor that pops up that lets you swap out backgrounds or objects. Pretty neat!</p>

<p>Winner here is Google Images search! Both of those photos are bad. ChatGPT nailed the fog, which Gemini omitted. Gemini is much closer to the mark but made up a city to the right. Both of them couldn’t produce the right angle for the sun. But hey, they’re both better than nothing!</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Gemini is here! I can now use it to create images from my phone.</p>
<p>As a consumer, I think the mobile experience of ChatGPT is really great. But if I’m on desktop I may use Gemini because it gives me four variations for each prompt. And it’s free. Can’t beat free.</p>
<p>But ChatGPT can do crazy things that Gemini can’t, such as the head to head battle.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Redemption</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-redemption.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Notice the words “in” and “through”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.6">2 Nephi 2.6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This provides some meaningful words. Rambling a bit here:</p>
<ul>
<li>in: because of?</li>
<li>through: by means of</li>
</ul>
<p>How are these two words different? One, Christ is a Being. He’s not an “amorphous entity”. By means of what He did for us, we can be redeemed. But it’s also because of who He is (presently as the Living Christ) in granting us forgiveness.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-risen-christ-by-the-tomb-redemption.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Risen Christ"> # Meaning</p>
<p>Christ’s atonement is infinite. It’s empowering to know that he’s already suffered for my sins of today and yesterday as well as tomorrow and beyond. Meaning, he already knows the mistakes I’m going to choose to make, which is kind of trippy in a way, but also comforting thinking about how He still loves me and knows how I’ll falter. That brings me peace knowing He knows me, who I am today, who I’ll develop into tomorrow.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Skimboarding</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/skimboarding.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Skimboarding is one of those oddly satisfying sports that isn’t exactly thrilling but just delightful enough that you can’t get enough. It’s like popcorn. Always delicious, but you want just one more.</p>
<p>The perfect setting is a beach with a long shore, so the tide comes in and slowly ripples out. This is when you can really glide.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 2 - Consecration</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-2-consecration.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Lehi, now in America after a long journey, sits his son, Jacob, down for a chat. He told him all his hard times would be rewarded:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall <strong>consecrate</strong> thine afflictions for thy gain. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-2.2">2 Nephi 2.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will <strong>consecrate</strong> thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-32.9.html">2-nephi-32.9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To consecrate is to “make or declare something sacred” (Oxford), or “to devote or dedicate exclusively to a purpose”.</p>
<p>From this lens, Jacob’s trials (like all his brothers and sisters) could be declared sacred (for the purposes of the Lord) and dedicated to the Lord’s purposes and cause.</p>
<p>Likewise, through prayer we can consecrate all of our acts. We can make them sacred devotions. What would your life be like if every day you dedicated it to the Lord? Where you did everything with a sacred purpose and cause?</p>
<p>And what if He made all those things consecrated for your spiritual gain?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-consecration-gift-to-cloud.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Consecration feels fuzzy, but it’s just giving yourself to something greater. It’s a mindset"> # Meaning</p>
<p>I can find more ways to consecrate my day and actions. To give myself with greater purpose.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Long Runs</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/long-runs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2020 my friend invited me to train for a marathon. Against better judgment, I accepted. I started training in Jan of 2021, prepping for a June marathon.</p>
<p>I said yes because I needed an excuse to work out and I like listening to audio content. Also, I began running a lot in college, which was good times. The best part is getting to the top of a mountain, running a mountain trail, or discovering a new route. It all seems so natural and human. Just you and the land.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-long-runs-wilderness.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">I actually did enjoy some beautiful scenery not too dissimilar to this while training.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There’s something enlivening about a long run. There’s an endorphin kick that boosts your mental state. Then while running, you keep finding ways to make the same route a little bit longer. Or make it exactly 5 miles.</p>
<p>I often would push my kids in the stroller. I’m not sure how they survived, but they did. There was a great long lath that was a perfect 5 mile there and back, with hardly any interruption.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why this memory came back to me, because I’m pretty sure I never want to train for a marathon again. It’s horrible. It takes so much time. And then I got injured so I couldn’t even compete. But deep down there’s still a longing for a long run.</p>

  <title>Protobufs - Everything I don’t know</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/protobufs-everything-i-dont-know.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>If you want a guide on Protobufs this isn’t it. These are my notes. Just stumbled on this tonight after having seen these all over the place at Google and I wanted to learn something.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffers Documentation</a> and ChatGPT. <a href="../tech/pkl-for-configuration-management.html">Pkl for Configuration Management</a> made me think of this. # The point of a Protobuf</p>
<ul>
<li>write one file</li>
<li>This file defines data structure, but not the data itself</li>
<li>Compile it to different languages (like Python)</li>
<li>A file in Python will be have a class defined with the properties in it</li>
<li>When you serialize data (send via JSON or something over an API) the other service knows how to read that data file immediately (if you built it and gave it the proto)
<ul>
<li>This makes sense to me why Google used this everywhere. They have one service in Python and another in Java and another in Go. To get them talking to each other they need a common data structure to read from.</li>
<li>The setters and getters help with the parsing a JSON blob for example.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Like first you define the protobuf</p>

<p>And then you compile it via a bash command and it turns to this:</p>

  <title>Pkl for Configuration Management</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/tech/pkl-for-configuration-management.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://pkl-lang.org/blog/introducing-pkl.html">Pkl</a> is the new kid on the block.</p>
<p>Have you ever built a config for a modeling pipeline? Surely, if you’ve built a pipeline to do experiments you’ve wondered how you can quickly iterate through a bunch of different settings to see which model is the best for your use case.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to generate a list of hypothesis to test, and then compare and contrast them.</p>
<p>Like any good data scientist you’ve created a system to loop over some settings.</p>
<p>It’s the big challenge of data science: how do I configure something? Should I build this function to do one thing or should I build a development environment where I can explore a thousand things? If I build a development environment how do I know if all the things I’ve configured aren’t going to be moot in a few weeks or months?</p>
<p>I don’t have the answer to those questions. But perhaps how we design our configs can affect those design decisions.</p>
<p>Pkl is cool because it lets you do a for loop to output configs.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic config file per their docs:</p>

<p>And here’s that config looped and rendered:</p>

<section id="application-to-ds" class="level1">
<h1>Application to DS</h1>
<p>I’m not 100% sure that this is any easier for a Python developer than just using ChatGPT to loop some parameters and spit out a bunch of yaml files. Because YAML does have some validation to it. And YAML has been around a long time.</p>
<p>Anything’s better than Python’s ConfigParser…yuck.</p>
<p>Reminds me of <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffers Documentation</a> but honestly I don’t know much about this stuff. See <a href="../tech/protobufs-everything-i-dont-know.html">Protobufs - Everything I don’t know</a></p>
<p>But it’s nice to see people are thinking about configs…</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Shake off the Chains</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-shake-off-the-chains.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures" class="level1">
<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>Keeping the commandments brings blessings:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.20">2 Nephi 1.20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it. Keeping the commandments means being honest, being kind, being respectful, finding a way to help others. Not being lazy. Being productive.</p>
<p>Literally, nobody can prosper without keeping some commandment. Without finding a way to meet someone’s need.</p>
<p>I also like this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.23">2 Nephi 1.23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a rallying cry we can all relate to. We are all bound with chains in life. But we don’t have to be. The call to “rise up” is a call to shake the chains to hold you bound. Arise from the dust!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-breaking-free-from-the-chains.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Break free from the chains"> # Meaning</p>
<p>It makes me wonder: what are the chains that hold me bound? Perhaps there are limiting beliefs.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for New York</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/new-york.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Since I was a kid, going to the city was a quarterly event. Whether going to the Bronx Zoo or the Met for a class field trip or a Yankees game, the city was always an adventure. As I grew up, it’d be the place to go to shows and concerts and visit family members who lived there.</p>
<p>Then when I was 22, I spent a summer as an intern there. Living in the city taught me what it means to be in the city.</p>
<p>From a guy who’d come up to help me with something on the Subway, to the lady who gave me some of her loose change to take the cross town bus, I was humbled by how people there look after each other. It’s hard to notice when the people are tough on the surface. But deep down they care for each other.</p>
<p>I’ve been to LA, and lived near SF, and DC and nothing compares to “city”.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/">Galileo AI</a>. It lets you mock up UI interfaces. Great story in their blog: <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/blog/seed">Galileo AI - Feb 6 Launch Announcement</a></p>
<p>It doesn’t export the code itself, but for a fee it’ll export to Figma for you. The cool thing is they trained or fine tuned an LLM specifically on design components. This is a cool use case of how people with specialized skill sets will create custom LLMs to compete in areas ChatGPT won’t be able to.</p>
<p>This is also showing the emergence in new software: don’t build a rules engine, train an LLM to solve the problem.</p>

  <title>2 Nephi 1 - Obtaining a Promised Land</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/christianity/2-nephi-1-land-of-promise.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="scriptures-a-land-of-promise" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Scriptures: A Land of Promise</h1>
<p>I thought about the phrase “land of promise” in <a href="../christianity/1-nephi-2-receiving-a-promised-land.html">1 Nephi 2 - Receiving a promised land</a> and there’s the verse in <a href="../scriptures/1-nephi-5.5.html">1 Nephi 5.5</a> where Lehi says “I have obtained a land of promise”. He says that years before arriving in the promised land.</p>
<p>But now, years later, he testifies:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>notwithstanding our afflictions, <strong>we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands</strong>; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. <a href="../scriptures/2-nephi-1.5">2 Nephi 1.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long did it take for them to receive that land? Many years. And many hardships. Lehi complained and was chastised at some point (1 Nephi 16). So the journey isn’t without its struggles.</p>

<section id="meaning" class="level1">
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p>The Lord is with us. Even if we complain and struggle, He wants to help us get to a better place, our promised lands.</p>
<p>We can be like Lehi and seek to obtain that personal vision. And receive a personal covenant of how the Lord wants to bless us in our lives.</p>

  <title>I’m Grateful for Kindness</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/gratitude/kindness.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been the recipient of a lot of kindness in my life. I know anyone reading this has too. Kindness is a wonderful gift to give someone. It doesn’t cost anything to be kind.</p>
<p>Ways people have been kind to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone called me when they knew I was making a big decision to listen to me.</li>
<li>Parents who showed me how to be kind to each other.</li>
<li>A friend who complemented me.</li>
<li>My wife who goes on dates with me and hangs out with me.</li>
<li>A child who wants to give dad a hug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindness does need to be <em>received</em>, I’ve learned. Kindness can be received when things are going well, as well as when life is tricky, though kindness is probably most poignantly felt and appreciated during hard times. I think that’s a gift: to receive kindness. It’s also a gift to give. Who do you know that could use some kindness today?</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">“Kindness. Watercolors. Expressionist.” Seems like kindness takes the form of an angel per Dalle. I think that’s appropriate.</figcaption>

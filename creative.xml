  <title>Prayer of Perspective</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/creative/prayer-of-perspective.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="prayer-of-perspective" class="level1">
<h1>Prayer of Perspective</h1>
<p>It’s has been worse for others, it’s currently worse for others, I’m grateful it’s not worse for me. May God bless those who suffer more than me, that they may feel the love and comfort of He who suffered beyond them all.</p>
<p>It’s hard for me. The fact it could be worse does not change the validity of my challenge. Perhaps it’s the hardest it’s ever been. But it will be harder yet, and I do not worry about that, do I? So why worry about the difficulty now. This too shall pass, because He has created a way for healing for me and for all.</p>
<p>It will be better. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe today. I know not what life holds. But because He has overcome all, it will be better. Through Him, I can</p>
<p>I will pursue better. More healthy. More happy. The suffering of others or the suffering of myself does not preclude me from greater happiness any more than I should let the greater happiness of others prevent my current suffering.</p>
<p>Life is all of this. The suffering and happiness of self. The suffering and happiness of others.</p>
<p>The choice therein is to pray for others. To pray for self. To invoke the divine on behalf of all of us with great charity and love, and to pursue the available happiness in all circumstances beyond our control. And to pursue better circumstances within my control. And to ask for sacred circumstances only accessible through asking and only gift able under His control.</p>
</section>
<section id="context" class="level1">
<h1>Context</h1>
<p>I read <a href="../book-review/the-happiest-man-on-earth.html">The Happiest Man on Earth</a> and wondered: how do I take Eddie’s story and use it to better my life. That was His wish after all “I do not seek revenge. I chose to have a happy life - the greatest revenge possible.”</p>
<p>Just because life is worse for others it dormant mean I can’t improve my own. It’s bad for others. It’s been worse for me. It’s been better for me. It’s been worse for Christ. But Eddie wants us all to experience happiness.</p>
<p>This is a prayer of perspective. Of acceptance.</p>

  <title>Nuzzle</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="nuzzle" class="level1">
<h1>Nuzzle</h1>
<p>It’s a strange thing. I can’t help but wonder if she knows what’s good for herself. But there she is, doing what she knows best. Night after night, more drinking.</p>
<p>Her eyes roll back and I can see the eyelids bulge slightly. She’s quite far gone at this point. I don’t mind.</p>
<p>I lean in and kiss her head. She lets out a little groan and drool drips out of the corner of her mouth. She leans in and falls on me. I let her. I nuzzle in. This is how it’s always been between us. You’d figure I’d find a way to work through it but we don’t talk much. It’s never really been her thing. And so here we are, night after night and I find myself talking care of her. Just more drinking and sleeping. She doesn’t even eat.</p>
<p>But that’s how it it’s always been…I’ve been in love with her since we first met a few months ago. When I found her she was helpless. Just laying there, crying - not knowing where she was or what her name was. So I gave her one. And in time she’ll call me dad.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanwhiting.com/img/dalle-nuzzle.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Nuzzle by the night sky"> *** Reading <a href="../book-review/the-sun-also-rises.html">The Sun Also Rises</a> right now and can’t help but think of the association. But with a twist.</p>

<h1>Breath on</h1>
<p>2024-02-12 Bryan Whiting</p>
<pre><code>You lay here on me
And I wonder
Are you breathing?

You are. 

How?

I wonder. How? You're only so little yet you know the key to life itself:

Breath. 

Breathe on. 

Your little chest rises and falls. 

Up. 

Down. 

Breath. 

You breathe on. 

My hand from palm to tip touches across the entirety of your rib cage. You're tiny. 

Yet you breathe. 

You breathe on me. </code></pre>

<h1>The Stairwell Scoop</h1>
<pre><code>Left hand: hotwheel
Right hand: Thomas book
In front of me: Mt Everest. 
Objective: descend. 
Difficulty with hands occupied: impossible
Expectation: ride on a Sherpa 
Request: grunt. "Ehhh!!" Paired with helpless eyes and full hands. Eyes that sag with "what am I supposed to do?"
Observation: dad approaches. Request accepted. 
Engagement: giant left arm behind my right hip. Diaper fully supported. Knees open, then latch like a Koala onto love handles. Maintain proper tension between knees and toes. 
Payment to Sherpa: a kind coo and pleasant, soft smile, like I own him. 
Response: more cuddles. I do own him. Probability of next successful Sherpa request: 97%. Probability heightens if I scuttle away fast at the bottom of Everest, shaking my hips. </code></pre>

  <title>The Thief of Time</title>
  <link>https://www.bryanwhiting.com/creative/prose-the-thief-of-time.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There are only two robbers of childhood: death and time.</p>
<p>Time is a death in a way. A cessation of your four year old self. Of your 10 year old self. Of your ignorant self. Of your yesterday self.</p>
<p>Time is constant, pushing us closer to one inevitable.</p>
<p>Time is a gift, the only gift we all share while here on earth.</p>
<p>What is the time constant? There’s a gravitational constant. A Planck constant. What about a time constant - the rate at which time ticks? At which our molecules age. At which our beings move from one state to another?</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll get the time to answer that…</p>

<p>How would you like to sleep next to a stranger?</p>
<p>How about <em>between</em> two strangers?</p>
<p>And sometimes you cuddle! But you can’t pick the strangers.</p>
<p>Oh! And all three of you are sleeping in chairs!</p>
<p>Does that sound like something you’d like? No? Hmm…</p>
<p>But what if you got a midnight snack, would that make it better?</p>
<p>Or if someone interrupted your sleep at 4am with an irrelevant megaphone announcement?</p>
<p>But what if there were not two, but 200 strangers?</p>
<p>…Why can’t I convince you? Okay, last try:</p>
<p>What if you all were sleeping in a moving object?</p>
<p>Going 700mph?</p>
<p>And everyone is suspended at 30,000 feet?</p>
<p>Yea, you’d like that? You’d pay a <em>lot</em> of money for that experience? Wow.</p>
<p>Well, I guess everybody has their limit.</p>

Black and shiny, half a square

You've got me smiling and I don't care</code></pre>

  <title>The Dove (Forevermore)</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A twist on “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven">The Raven</a>”, from <a href="../book-review/the-best-of-edgar-allen-poe.html">The Best of Edgar Allen Poe</a>. Poe got it all wrong.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven">The Raven</a>” recently, take a moment first to remember, remember that Raven of yore.</p>
<section id="the-dove-forevermore" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>The Dove (Forevermore)</h1>
<p><em>A twist on “The Raven”</em> by Bryan Whiting</p>
<pre><code>Three A.M., I hear you wrapping.
Desitin, I keep slapping.
Diapers fresh, for poop, post napping.
Diapers fresh, for my Adore.

It was a cold and bleak December.
Dark and dreary, I remember.
Sleepless nights and occasional frights,    
I'd forgotten the parent's implore:
  please protect my Sweet Adore   

Nothing strange, just parents living.
Babies growing, always swimming
through the tides of life they're dipping,    
  dripping, 
    tripping, slick socks 
        slipping    
    lovey, pants, they all keep ripping    
"Will it stop?", my mind is tipping
I love them so, my Adore.   
But I just ask rest, I implore.    
Will I get it? 
  "Nevermore."    

What's that I hear, is something slapping?    
No! by Jove! A creature crapping!    
Crapping on my kitchen floor!! 
Right next to the. bathroom..door...
I just cannot believe for sure.
Not another chore.
I just mopped there, I can assure.
I feel denial swelling more.
  That creature must be 
    her 
  Adore.  

Then in Jan the rain starts stalling.  
On my chest, her eyes are falling,  
Napping, cooing, smiling, fawning,
My bedroom window, in Jan is calling
Calling in a creature, sure.

"What's this?" I wonder, as I slumber.
Is it just me, or am I dumber?    
Is that a bird?! What's that number? 
"Animal control!" I now thunder,
"For the dove! Not one mess more!!"
"Begone, you bird!" I implore!
It cocks its head, 
  "Nevermore."

Something changed, as I remember,
after that, cold, bleak December.
The sleep rolled in, and so I weather,
  weather just a little bit more.

The baby's coos I now see freshly.
The piqued smiles now enmesh me.
The drools of milk now refresh me.
"Refresh me, my Adore."
How could I ever
  have seen anything more?
    Please don't let it end, I implore.
The dove then whispers, 
  "Evermore."

The children calling, wailing, falling
at my feet, screaming, brawling,
incessant thumping, pounding, hounding,
  is pleasant to my ears once more.
Pleasant because they're my Adore.

I see it now, that bright December.
It wasn't dark, I now remember.
Just a dog, a fog, but nothing more. 
But now it's gone, and nevermore.
I took photos, Polaroids, sure.
But now it's gone. 
  And I want more. 

Remembered now are the cuddles.
Long forgotten: spilled milk puddles.
Spilled milk puddles are 
  nevermore. 

Days asleep and nights awake.
Dream eyes open, for goodness sake.
What I wouldn't give to take
another look at my Make.
Another look at 
    my 
  Adore.

When I could hold her, and nothing more. 
When in my hands, and on the floor
we cuddle, huddle, muddle more.
"Bring it back", I implore
"Turn back time", I plead pure.

Then entered in that dove once more, 
the welcomed bird, the dove of yore.
"The past is gone, time pressed its seal.
But yours to keep, for it is real
past and present, space time is traveled
In eternity, your gift unravels
  Forevermore."</code></pre>
<p>The tides of parenting are just phases. The good, the bad, the guilt, the love, the denial you even have kids to the overwhelming joy you could never express adequately in words…it all comes and goes - sometimes within the same hour.</p>
<p>Then suddenly we realize it’s all gone before we can blink.</p>
<p>The newborn is now walking at my feet. The eighteeen-month-old-diaper-generator is now riding his bike. The four-year-old brother slapper is now six and creating “Daddy, I love you” cards. Thankfully families are forevermore.</p>
<p><em>(Mostly) written 5:02am on Jan 5, 2024, after a sweet midnight feeding, where she cooed and smiled right before passing out peacefully on my chest.</em></p>

<p>Other lines…</p>
<pre><code>Pints of puke are never more
Once held lovey is now a bore
once scraped knees now never sore
going to the park now a chore</code></pre>

The weeks pass by like days.
The sun continues to set

restful nights, a delusion,

But still my kids want to play</code></pre>
